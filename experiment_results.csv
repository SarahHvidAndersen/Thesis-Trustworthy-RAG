Even with a small number of variables, the number of possible questions grows astronomically. Say that we have 10 causal variables, each of which takes only two values (0 or 1). There are roughly 30 million possible queries that we could ask, such as “What is the probability that the outcome is 1, given that we see variable X equals 1 and we make variable Y equal 0 and variable Z equal 1?” If there were more variables, or more than two states for each one, the number of possibilities would grow beyond our ability to even imagine. Searle’s list would need to have more entries than the number of atoms in the universe. So it is clear that a dumb list of questions and answers will never be able to simulate the intelligence of a child, let alone an adult. Humans must have some compact representation of the information needed in their brains, as well as an effective procedure to interpret each question properly and extract the right answer from the stored representation. To pass the mini-Turing test, therefore, we need to equip machines with a similarly efficient representation and answer-extraction algorithm. The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect – Pearl and Mackenzie 20 Such a representation not only exists, but it has childlike simplicity: a causal diagram. We have already seen one example, the diagram for the mammoth hunt. Considering the extreme ease with which people can communicate their knowledge with dot-and-arrow diagrams, I believe that our brains indeed use a representation something like this. But more important for our purposes, these models pass the mini-Turing test; no other model is known to do so. Let’s look at some examples. Suppose that a prisoner is about to be executed by a firing squad. A certain chain of events has to occur for this to happen. First, the court has to order the execution. The order goes to a captain, who signals the soldiers on the firing squad (A and B) to fire', 'distance': 0.39221593737602234}, {'id': 'Decision_making_microsoft_word_-_ch-1_final_withfigs.docx_page-1-33.json_chunk_18', 'metadata': {'author': 'Dana Mackenzie', 'chunk_id': 'Decision_making_microsoft_word_-_ch-1_final_withfigs.docx_page-1-33.json_chunk_18', 'course': 'Decision_making', 'date_published': '2017-10-17', 'document_type': 'book', 'keywords': '', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Decision_making\\pdf_material\\Book_of_why_chapter_1.pdf', 'title': 'The Book of Why - chapter 1'}, 'text': '. Without a representation, we wouldn’t know how to store information for future usage. Even if we could let our robot manipulate its environment at will, whatever information we learned this way is destined to be forgotten, unless our robot is endowed with a template to encode the results of those manipulations. One major contribution of AI to the study of cognition has been the paradigm: “Representation first, acquisition second.” Often it turned out that the quest for a good representation led to insights on how the knowledge ought to be acquired, be it from data or a programmer. The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect – Pearl and Mackenzie 19 When I describe the mini-Turing test to people, one common reaction is to claim that it can easily be defeated by cheating. For example, take the list of all possible questions, store their correct answers, and then read them out from memory when asked. There is no way to distinguish (so the argument goes) between a machine that stores a dumb question-answer list and one that answers the way that you and I do it, that is, by understanding the question and producing an answer using a mental causal model. So what would the mini-Turing test prove, if cheating is so easy? This cheating possibility, known as the “Chinese Room Argument,” was introduced in 1980 by the philosopher John Searle to challenge Turing’s claim that the ability to fake intelligence amounts to having intelligence. Searle’s challenge has only one flaw: cheating is not easy; in fact it is impossible. Even with a small number of variables, the number of possible questions grows astronomically. Say that we have 10 causal variables, each of which takes only two values (0 or 1)', 'distance': 0.3932468295097351}]"

The same collections of weights W , U and B are used as each element of the sequence is processed. The output layer produces a sequence of predictions O l from the current activation A l , but typically only the last of these, O L , is of relevance.

Many in the field believe that the major reason for these successes is the availability of ever-larger training datasets, made possible by the wide-scale use of digitization in science and industry. In this chapter we discuss the basics of neural networks and deep learing, and then go into some of the specializations for specific problems, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification, and rcurrent neural networks (RNNs) for time series and other sequences.

The hidden layer computes activations A k = h k ( X ) that are nonlinear transformations of linear combinations of the inputs X 1 , X 2 , , X p . Hence these A k are not directly oserved. The functions h k ( · ) are not fixed in advance, but are learned during the training of the network. The output layer is a linear model that uses these actvations A k as inputs, resulting in a function f ( X ) . will also demonstrate these models using the Python torch package, along with a number of helper packages. The material in this chapter is slightly more challenging than elsewhere in this book. 10.1 Single Layer Neural Networks A neural network takes an input vector of p variables X = ( X 1 , X 2 , , X p ) and builds a nonlinear function f ( X ) to predict the response Y . We have built nonlinear prediction models in earlier chapters, using trees, boosting and generalized additive models. What distinguishes neural networks from these methods is the particular structure of the model. Figure 10.1 shows a simple feed-forward neural network for modeling a quantitative response feed-forward neural network using p = 4 predictors. In the terminology of neural networks, the four fetures X 1 , , X 4 make up the units in the input layer .

Even with a small number of variables, the number of possible questions grows astronomically. Say that we have 10 causal variables, each of which takes only two values (0 or 1). There are roughly 30 million possible queries that we could ask, such as “What is the probability that the outcome is 1, given that we see variable X equals 1 and we make variable Y equal 0 and variable Z equal 1?” If there were more variables, or more than two states for each one, the number of possibilities would grow beyond our ability to even imagine. Searle’s list would need to have more entries than the number of atoms in the universe. So it is clear that a dumb list of questions and answers will never be able to simulate the intelligence of a child, let alone an adult. Humans must have some compact representation of the information needed in their brains, as well as an effective procedure to interpret each question properly and extract the right answer from the stored representation. To pass the mini-Turing test, therefore, we need to equip machines with a similarly efficient representation and answer-extraction algorithm. The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect – Pearl and Mackenzie 20 Such a representation not only exists, but it has childlike simplicity: a causal diagram. We have already seen one example, the diagram for the mammoth hunt. Considering the extreme ease with which people can communicate their knowledge with dot-and-arrow diagrams, I believe that our brains indeed use a representation something like this. But more important for our purposes, these models pass the mini-Turing test; no other model is known to do so. Let’s look at some examples. Suppose that a prisoner is about to be executed by a firing squad. A certain chain of events has to occur for this to happen. First, the court has to order the execution. The order goes to a captain, who signals the soldiers on the firing squad (A and B) to fire', 'distance': 0.3855539858341217}]"
what is parameter recovery in cognitive modelling?,"Parameter recovery refers to the process of using model-based methods to estimate the parameters (such as learning rate, softmax temperature) that govern a model's behavior. These parameters are typically learned during training and can significantly influence the predictions made by the model.

In other words, parameter recovery is about re-estimating the underlying parameters that make up a model, often after the data has been generated or simulated under those specific conditions. This process involves using the model to generate new data, then fitting those new data points back into the original model to refine the estimates of the parameters.

Parameter recovery is an important aspect of cognitive modeling because it allows researchers and practitioners to:

1. **Verify model predictions**: By re-estimating the parameters, researchers can ensure that their model is generating accurate predictions under different conditions.
2. **Improve model performance**: Refining parameter estimates through parameter recovery can lead to better-performing models that are more effective at predicting or classifying new data.
3. **Increase confidence in model interpretation**: When parameter recovery yields consistent results across multiple experiments, it provides a stronger basis for interpreting the findings of cognitive modeling.

Parameter recovery is often contrasted with cross-validation, which involves splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data. While cross-validation helps ensure that models are not overfitting or underfitting, parameter recovery allows researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving the model's behavior.","[""Parameter recovery refers to the process of using model-based methods to estimate the parameters (such as learning rate, softmax temperature) that govern a model's behavior.

As before, we set the means of each bandit at 1 1⁄4 0 : 2 and 2 1⁄4 0 : 8 and the number of trials at T 1⁄4 1000 . We then simulated the actions of the model according to Equtions 3 and 4 , with learning rate, a , and softmax temperature, b , set according to a ~ U ð 0 ; 1 Þ and b ~ Exp ð 10 Þ (9) After simulating the model, we fit the parameters using a maximum likelihood approach to get fit values of learning rate, a , and softmax parameter, b . We then repeated this process 1000 times using new values of a and b each time. The results are plotted in Box 4—figure 1 below. As is clear from this plot, there is fairly good agreement between the simulated and fit paramter values. In addition, we can see that the fit for b is best with a range, 1 < b < 10 , and that ouside this range, the correspondence between simulation and fit is not as good. If we further select points where parameter recovery for a is bad (i.e., when j a sim a fit j > 0 : 25 , grey dots in Box 4—figure 1 ), we find that parameter recovery for a is worse when b is outside of the range. Depending on the values of b that we obtain by fitting human behavior, this worse corrspondence at small and large b values may or may not be problematic.

A note about parameter differences between different populations or conditions: a growing use of model fitting is to compare parameter values between populations (e.g. schizophrenia patients vs healthy controls [ Collins et al., 2014 ]) or conditions (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation to one area or another [ Zajkowski et al., 2017 ]). If your primary interest is a difference like this, then paraeter recovery can be used to give an estimate of statistical power. In particular, for a proposed effect size (e.g., on the average difference in one parameter between groups or conditions) you can simlate and recover parameters for the groups or conditions and then perform statistical tests to detect group differences in this simulated data set. The power for this effect size is then the frequency with which the statistical tests detect no effect given that the effect is there. Remember that even successful parameter recovery represents a bescase scenario! What does successful parameter recovery tell you? That data generated by a known model with given parameters can be fit to recover those parameters. This is the best case you could possibly hope for in the model-based analysis and it is unlikely to ever occur as the ‘true’ generative process for behavior — that is, the inner workings of the mind and brain — is likely much more complex than any model you could conceive. There’s no easy answer to this problem. We only advise that you remember to be humble when you present your results! Box 4. Example: parameter recovery in the reinforcement learning model. We performed parameter recovery with Model 3, the Rescorla Wagner model, on the twarmed bandit task. As before, we set the means of each bandit at 1 1⁄4 0 : 2 and 2 1⁄4 0 : 8 and the number of trials at T 1⁄4 1000', 'distance': 0.2956114411354065}]"
