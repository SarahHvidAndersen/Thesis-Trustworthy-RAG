This will provide students with a deeper knowledge of conceptual theories of cognition, and with skills in formalising theory and applying it to data. It will also prepare students to use theories from cognitive science in the development of software agents capable of performing simple cognitive tasks (i.e. artificial intelligence systems).\nThe course includes 1) an introduction to general frameworks for formalising cognitive theories, including specific mathematical models; and 2) the application of advanced statistical methods for evaluating formal models of cognition, and for applying models to data.\nThis course integrates conceptual and theoretical knowledge about cognitive functions with 1) formal modelling tools, and 2) statistical methods for fitting theory to data. The course builds on the decision-making course. The course places theoretical knowledge in cognitive science within the broader perspective of philosophical issues surrounding theory construction in cognitive science.\nAcademic objectives:\nIn the evaluation of the student’s performance, emphasis is placed on the extent to which the student is able to:\nKnowledge:\n- describe common mathematical and computational approaches to modelling cognition\n- explain the relationship between conceptual theories of cognition and mathematical/computational models\n- show how specific mathematical and computational models express conceptual theories\n- reflect on philosophical issues surrounding theory construction in cognitive science.\nSkills:\n- use advanced statistical methods to evaluate and compare different models when applied to the same data set\n- design simple software agents implementing theories of cognitive function.\nCompetences:\n- formalise verbally stated conceptual theories of cognitive function.\nSee all\nECTS\n10\nLevel\nMaster\nSemester\nMA, 2nd semester\nLanguage of instruction\nEnglish\nHours - week - period\nTime and place will be announced no later than at the start of the semester here:\nhttps://timetable.au.dk/schedule\nType of course\nOrdinary\nPrimary programme\nMaster's Degree Programme in Cognitive Science\nDepartment\nSchool of Communication and Culture\nFaculty\nArts\nLocation\nAarhus\nSTADS UVA code\n147222U006\nCopy UVA code\nTeaching\nForms of instruction\nLecture and classroom instruction\nInstructor\nSee all\nRiccardo Fusaroli\nInstitut for Kommunikation og Kultur - Kognitionsvidenskab\nComments on the form of instruction\nRead more\nLectures and classroom instruction\nStudents produce a number of assignments during the course. At the start of the semester, the teacher will inform the students of the number of assignments, their form, length and deadlines both on Brightspace and orally. The assignments can provide the basis for various forms of feedback and further development related to the teaching, but the individual assignments are not assessed on a continuous basis. All or some of these assignments can provide the basis for the student’s exam.\nLanguage of instruction:\nThe rules governing language of exam and teaching are stated in section 2.1 of the academic regulations.\nLiterature\nRead more\nWill be announced on Brightspace at the start of the semester.\nExamination\nForm of examination\nTake-home assignment (Assign)\nForm of co-examination\nInternal co-examination\nAssessment\nPassed /failed\nPermitted exam aids\nNot specified\nComments\nRead more\nOrdinary exam and re-examination:\nThe exam consists of a portfolio containing 3-7 of assignments. The number of assignments as well as their form and eventual length will be announced on Brightspace by the teacher at the start of the semester. The portfolio may include products. Depending on their length, and subject to the teacher’s approval, these products can replace some of the standard pages in the portfolio.\nIt must be possible to carry out an individual assessment. So if some parts of the portfolio have been produced by a group, it must be stated clearly which parts each student is responsible for, and which parts the group as a whole is responsible for.\nThe complete portfolio must be submitted for assessment in WISEflow before the deadline set in the examination plan. Each student submits a portfolio.",
