Key Takeaways • Make important information or key actions visually distinctive. • Use restraint when placing emphasis on visual elements to avoid them competing with one another and to ensure salient items don’t get mistakenly identified as ads. • Don’t exclude those with a color vision deficiency or low vision by relying exclusively on color to communicate contrast. • Carefully consider users with motion sensitivity when using motion to communicate contrast. Overview Thousands of years of evolution have given humans an incredibly sophisticated system of vision and cognitive processing. We can identify objects in fractions of a second, we possess superior pattern processing capabilities in comparison to other living things, and we have an innate ability to spot small differences in 77 \n1 Mark P.

Our focus is not only dictated by the goals we seek to accomplish, but also directed by these instinctual abilities. They also affect how we encode information in memory, and therefore our ability to recall items and events at a later point—recognition is prioritized over recall. When it comes to digital interfaces, an interesting consideration is the ten- dency of contrasting elements to draw our attention faster. A primary challenge we have as designers is managing what users will focus on in an interface, while supporting them in achieving their goals. On the one hand, visual emphasis can be used to guide users toward a goal by capturing their attention. On the other hand, too many points of visual emphasis will compete with one another and make it harder for people to find the information they need. Color, shape, size, position, and motion are all factors that come into play in directing the attention of users, and we must carefully consider each of these when building interfaces. Origins The von Restorff effect is named after German psychiatrist and pediatrician Hed- wig von Restorff, who found in a 1933 study employing the isolation paradigm that participants presented with a list of categorically similar items best remem- bered ones that were distinctly different. 2 In other words, memory is improved for items of a set that are visually or conceptually isolated from the other items. While von Restorff wasn’t the first to investigate the effects of this paradigm on memory, it became closely associated with her and the study of distinctiveness. Her initial findings would later be corroborated by research, such as that by Shel- ley Taylor and Susan Fiske (1978), suggesting that people are drawn to salient, novel, surprising, or distinctive stimuli. 3 \n4 Klaus Oberauer, “Working Memory and Attention—A Conceptual Analysis and Review,” Journal of Cognition 2, no. 1 (2019): 36. 5 Kara Pernice, “Banner Blindness Revisited: Users Dodge Ads on Mobile and Desktop,” Nielsen Norman Group, April 22, 2018, https://www.nngroup.com/articles/banner-blindness-old-and-new-findings . PSYCHOLOGY CONCEPT Selective Attention, Banner Blindness, and Change Blindness Simply put, humans live in a world of distraction. Every day, at any given moment, we are subjected to a plethora of sensory information. While driving, at work, when attending a social event or simply shopping online, most people have a multitude of signals competing for their attention. Objects within our field of view might be visible, but we don’t always see them. The reason for this is because attention plays a fundamental role in how we perceive the world around us. In order to maintain focus on information that is important or relevant to the task at hand, we often filter out information that isn’t relevant. In other words, our ability to focus on the things around us is limited in terms of capacity and dura- tion, so we focus on relevant information to the detriment of nonrelevant information. It’s a survival instinct known in cognitive psychology as selective attention , and it’s critical not only to how we humans perceive the world around us but also to how we process sensory information in critical moments that could mean the difference between life and death. Like we saw in Chapter 4 regarding Miller’s law and the capacity of short-term memory, attention is also a limited resource. Though there are different ways of conceptualizing memory and attention, there is broad agreement in the psychological community that working memory is closely related to attention. 4 The implications of this with regard to dig- ital products and services is significant, since the interfaces people inter- act with must guide their attention, prevent them from being overwhelmed or distracted, and help them in finding the relevant infor- mation or action. One example of selective attention that is common in digital inter- faces is the user behavior known as banner blindness . Banner blindness describes the tendency for people to ignore elements that they perceive to be advertisements, and it is a strong and robust phenomenon that’s been documented across three decades. 5 When you consider banner \nblindness in the context of our limited capacity for attention, it makes sense that we’d ignore anything that we don’t typically find helpful (e.g., digital ads). Instead, people are more likely to search for items that help them achieve their goals—especially design patterns such as navigation, search bars, headlines, links, and buttons (as Jakob’s law dictates, they will also instinctively look for these items in common locations). Even legitimate content elements may be ignored if they remotely resemble ads or are placed in close proximity to them. Therefore, it’s good to be aware of when visually differentiating content could inadvertently lead to it being mistaken for an ad. Related to banner blindness is change blindness , which describes the tendency for people to fail to notice significant changes when they lack strong enough visual cues, or when their attention is focused else- where. Since our attention is a limited resource, we often ignore informa- tion we deem irrelevant in order to complete tasks efficiently. Because our attention is focused on what appears to be most salient, we may overlook even major differences introduced elsewhere. If it’s important that the user be aware of certain changes to the interface of a product or service, we should take care to ensure that their attention is drawn to the elements in question. Examples As you can imagine, examples of the von Restorff effect can be found in every digital product and service, some of which make use of it more effectively than others. The need to make specific elements or content visually distinct is funda- mental in design. When this technique is used sparingly and strategically, the contrast that it affords not only helps draw attention but also directs people to the most valuable information. A common example of this visual phenomenon can be found in the design of interactive elements such as buttons, text links, and the like. The visual differ- entiation of these elements can help draw people’s attention and inform them of the actions available to them, guiding users in completing tasks and preventing them from taking actions they didn’t intend to. To demonstrate, take a look at the example in Figure 8-1 , which depicts two versions of a confirmation modal: one with buttons that are visually indistinct from one another, and another with emphasis placed on the most important button. The lack of visual contrast in the \nmodal on the left could easily lead to people accidentally selecting the wrong action. By placing a visual emphasis on the destructive action, the version on the right will not only help guide users who want to delete their accounts to the cor- rect option but will also help those who don’t intend to delete their accounts avoid accidentally selecting this option. For extra safety, there is also a warning icon included in the header of the modal on the right to help draw attention and communicate the importance of the content within the modal. Figure 8-1. Example of how contrast can be used to draw attention to important actions and help users avoid accidentally selecting the wrong option Let’s take the button example a step further and look at an interface that moves beyond the simple use of color to create contrast. The floating action but- ton (FAB), a design pattern introduced by Google’s Material Design ( Figure 8-2 ), “performs the primary, or most common, action on a screen.” By providing guidelines around the design of this element, its placement on the screen, and what actions it should perform, Google ensures its consistency across various products and services. As a result, it has become a familiar pattern that people recognize and that therefore helps to guide their experience (so this is also an example of Jakob’s law in action). \nFigure 8-2. Examples of the floating action button from Material Design (sources: Gmail and Google Calendar, 2019) Another common example of the von Restorff effect can be found in pricing tables. Subscription plans are available for most of the services we use, and often companies will emphasize one option over the others. To achieve this emphasis, designers frequently differentiate the option they want to call out by adding vis- ual cues. Take, for example, Dropbox, which places emphasis on the “advanced” option ( Figure 8-3 ) through the use of color (an accent color is applied to the “Try free” button), shape (the card appears slightly larger due to the “Best value” ele- ment at the top), and position (placing the card in the center of the display). Figure 8-3. An example of the von Restorff effect in a pricing table (source: Dropbox, 2019) \nThe von Restorff effect can also be seen in design elements intended to grab our attention. Take notifications, for example ( Figure 8-4 ), which are meant to inform users when something requires them to take action. These ubiquitous elements can be found in almost every app or service and are designed to grab our attention, for better or worse. Figure 8-4. Employing the von Restorff effect to call attention to notifications (source: iOS, 2019) We can extend the thinking behind the von Restorff effect and apply it to design going beyond singular elements as well. Take, for example, news web- sites, which commonly place emphasis on featured content in order to make it stand out against lots of other headlines, images, and ads ( Figure 8-5 ). The con- sistent pattern you’ll notice on these websites is the use of scale to create contrast between the featured content and adjacent content. The reader’s attention is drawn to the information that breaks out of the implied columns of content. As these examples illustrate, visual contrast can be created in many ways. Color is a common way to differentiate elements, but it is by no means the only way to create contrast. Scale, shape, negative space, and motion are additional properties that can make specific elements or content stand out in comparison to adjacent information. \nFigure 8-5. News websites often use scale to emphasize featured headlines (sources [clockwise from top left]: Bloomberg, ProPublica, the New York Times, and the Boston Globe, 2019) KEY CONSIDERATION Moderation and Accessibility There are some important things to consider when it comes to applying the von Restorff effect in design. The first is when and how often contrast should be created—this effect should be used with intention, and not overused. The only thing worse than no contrast is way too much, which can not only dilute the power of the elements or content that you intended to stand out but also visually overwhelm people. It’s wise to use restraint when placing emphasis on visual elements to ensure they don’t compete with each other. The importance of moderation is even clearer when we take into account factors such as banner blindness and change blindness. If the visual emphasis on content causes it to be mistakenly identified as an advertisement, then it’s likely to be ignored. Additionally, if too many items are emphasized, people are less likely to notice important informa- tion or changes when they occur: they may either be distracted or auto- matically tune out the “noise.” The next consideration is accessibility. It’s crucial to have an aware- ness of which visual properties you are using to create contrast and how they affect different people. Take, for example, people with color vision deficiency, who are unable to distinguish certain shades of color (or, in \nsome cases, see any color). For these users, relying solely on color to communicate visual contrast is problematic and will result in a less than ideal user experience. Further, vision impairments such as cataracts can affect how people perceive detail and difference, causing them to miss subtle differentiations between elements. In addition to these considera- tions, it’s important that we ensure sufficient color contrast exists between foreground and background elements to help those who have trouble seeing specific colors or have an impairment that results in low vision. Contrast is also sometimes provided through the use of motion, but it’s important to consider how this might affect users with a vestibular disorder, or with any disease, damage, or injury to the system connected to the inner ear and brain that processes the sensory information involved with controlling balance and eye movements. Take, for example, those with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) or labyrinthitis, in whom motion can trigger dizziness, nausea, headaches, or worse. In addition, motion can affect those with epilepsy and migraine sensitivi- ties. We must carefully consider when and how we use motion in our designs to ensure users with motion sensitivity aren’t negatively affected. Conclusion The von Restorff effect is a powerful guideline for how to use contrast to direct people’s attention to the most relevant content. It can help to inform our design decisions when we want to place emphasis on critical or important actions or information, and help to ensure that users of our products and services can quickly identify what they need to achieve their goals. Contrast can also become problematic when not used with restraint. When designers differentiate elements visually, the effect is to draw the user’s attention. If too many elements are visu- ally competing with each other, their power is diluted and they no longer stand out amongst the other elements. Additionally, we must be aware of how visual properties we use to create contrast are perceived by those with vision deficien- cies and how they might affect people with motion sensitivities."
