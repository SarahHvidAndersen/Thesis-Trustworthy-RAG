If you did, you probably know that it’s not easy. It is an example of stimulus–response incompatibility. Back in the 1950s, the psychologists Paul Fitts (well known in human–computer interaction for thelaw that bears his name) and Charles Seeger ran a series of experiments which demonstrated this concept. They asked people to respond to a stimulus that appeared on their left or right side by pressing two buttons: Fitts found that participants were faster in the first condition, which presented a stimulus–response compatibility. Definition:Stimulus–response compatibilityis the degree to which the physical arrangement of the stimuli matches the location of the expected responses. Stimulus–response compatibility is highly relevant for design. When an object or an interface violates it, its usability decreases significantly. Consider these two stoves. Which knob controls which burner? Does one stove make you feel more confident in your guess? Consider this picture I took not long ago of a ticket machine at a train station. After paying with a credit card, the machine asked for my ZIP code as a security measure. But, to my confusion, the yellow numbered buttons were not touchable. Dumbfounded, I repeatedly tapped the yellow on-screen numbers, thinking that maybe the screen was frozen or had a slow response time. Then, I noticed the column of metal buttons on either side of the screen. Each column was numbered 1-6. To my surprise (and horror), pressing the button marked ‘1’ on the right column, caused a ‘6’ to appear in the zip code field. Pressing the metal button for 2 caused a ‘7’ to appear on the screen. I couldn’t believe it. It felt physically and cognitively unnatural to press one number to get a different number to appear. My slow reaction time to press each button was a direct result of stimulus–response incompatibility. The concept of stimulus–response compatibility can be extended beyond its spatial dimension. This is exactly what Don Norman does in his book “The Design of Everyday Things”. Definition:Natural mappingrefers to a design in which the system’s controls represent or correspond to the desired outcome. When controls map to the actions that will result, systems are faster to learn and easier to remember. Natural mappings bridge thegulf of execution, helping users to understand how a system can be used and what actions are required to accomplish their goal. Designers can create natural mappings in several ways, including the three common patterns below: For a system to be easy to learn, people need to quickly understand how it works, what actions are possible, and how to accomplish their goals. Designs that have a high stimulus–response compatibility and take advantage of natural mappings can help users act faster and with more confidence. Fitts, P. M., & Seeger, C. M.
