    "text": "The Five Mistakes You’ll Make as a Usability Test Moderator What are the most common mistakes that test moderators make? We’ve observed  usability tests moderated by consultants, in-house researchers, junior UX researchers and experienced practitioners and there are some common mistakes we come across time and again. These mistakes are like a rite of passage on the route to becoming a UX researcher, but even experienced practitioners aren’t immune from making them. Moderating a usability test is full of bear traps. The moderator may fail to set expectations (by reviewing the purpose of the test and describing the moderator’s role), forget to reassure the participant (“We’re not test- ing you”), or fail to check for understanding (by asking the participant to repeat the task in his or her own words). other common mistakes include asking leading or biased questions, and quizzing participants on how they would design the interface. But there are five mistakes that we see usability test moderators make fre- quently and that eclipse all of these. They are: • Talking too much. • Explaining the design. • Answering questions. • Interviewing rather than testing. • Soliciting opinions and preferences. Talking Too Much When moderating a usability test, you need to fight against the tendency to talk too much. This can happen in two places: at the beginning of the test; and during the session itself. It’s true that you need to provide an introduction to the session to put the participant at ease; and you also need to explain the kind of feedback that you want from the thinking aloud technique. But you shouldn’t go over- board in your introduction: Five minutes or so is usually enough. \nUsability testing is about observing participants while they carry out real- istic tasks. This means the golden rule is to shut up. Although moderators tell us they know this, we still see many of them (even some experienced ones) failing to practice it. In the white heat of the test session, they can’t stop themselves from filling the silence. This happens partly because people are not comfortable with silence and partly because there’s a misconception that if the participant isn’t speak- ing, then you’re not learning anything. But because you’re interested in participant behavior, it’s fine to have periods of silence. of course you want participants to think aloud—but at the same time, you need to allow par- ticipants space to read, make judgments and generally think about what they are doing. You can avoid this trap by learning to embrace the silence. Ask partici- pants to do the task. Then shut up, observe, and listen to what they say. If you feel the urge to speak, use a phrase like, “Tell me more about that.” If you force yourself to use the same stock phrase, and none other, it will help you stay silent (you’ll sound stupid if you use it incessantly to fill the silence)—and you won’t do too much damage because you’ll encourage the participant to talk. Explaining the Design If you ever find yourself saying to a test participant, “What the develop- ers are trying to do here is…,” or “The reason they designed it this way is because…,” or “What you don’t understand is…,” then you should slap your- self. When you explain the design of your product to a test participant, it causes two problems. First, you’re no longer able to find out how someone will really behave when they first encounter the design. This is because you’ve given the partici- pant some background information that real users probably won’t have. And second, even if you were never involved in the design of the prod- uct, you affiliate yourself with it. Because what the participant hears isn’t an explanation of the product but a defence of the product. This prevents you being seen as a neutral observer and makes it more likely that participants will self-censor their comments. The point where this problem occurs most frequently is during the test tasks themselves. The participant may use the product the “wrong” way and the mod- erator feels the need to explain how to use it “properly.” or the participant may be critical of something in the interface, and the moderator feels the urge to defend \nthe design with a phrase like, “The development team thought about doing it that way, but…” or the participant may completely misunderstand something in the interface, at which point the moderator will want to correct the participant’s mis- understanding. In particularly bad situations, this moderating style risks turning the usability test into a coaching session, or even an argument. Believe us when we say that no usability test moderator ever won an argu- ment with a participant. If you ever feel the urge to explain the interface or use a phrase like, “Yes, but…,” then instead say, “Tell me what you’re doing right now.” You’ll then get behind the behavior without influencing it too much. If you really, really want to explain how to use the product or correct any misconceptions, then wait until the end of the session, once participants have tried it without your help. Answering Questions Here’s another trap we see moderators walk into. It’s like watching a slow- motion replay of a dog chasing a stick over a cliff. The participant sets the trap and the moderator runs towards it. Like most traps, it seems fairly innocuous. The participant simply asks a question. now, participant questions are like gold dust. You want participants to ask questions because this indicates they are experiencing a problem with the product: They’re not sure how to proceed, so they ask you. Gold dust, but not gold. You find the gold by observing how the participant answers their ques- tion: What do they do to solve the problem? Do they find it easy to fix or do they consistently take the wrong path? It’s their behavior that helps you distinguish a low priority problem from a critical one. This means the route to the gold is to refuse to answer the question. But to any normal human being, refusing to answer a question is alien. From childhood, we’re conditioned to think that ignoring a question makes us appear either rude or stupid. That’s why so many test moderators walk blindly into the trap of answering participants’ questions. Here’s the way to fix this in your own practice. First, in your preamble, tell par- ticipants you want them to ask questions but you won’t answer, because you want the session to be realistic. Use a phrase like, “Just do what you would do if I wasn’t here.” This then gives you permission not to answer any questions you’re asked. Then, when the inevitable question comes at you during the session, use the “boomerang” technique: Answer the question with a question. So, if \nthe participant asks, “How do I get back to the beginning?,” you respond: “How do you think you get back to the beginning?” If the participant asks, “Whereabouts is the registration form?,” you reply: “Where would you look for it?” Interviewing Rather than Testing If you’ve invested time in getting participants to attend your session, it makes sense to get as much out of them as possible. So you should certainly run a pre-test interview with participants before they start the test tasks to find out more about them and their relevant goals. But while the participant carries out the test tasks—which should represent the bulk of their time in a usability test—you’re an observer. Here’s a common situation that causes a usability test to degrade into an interview: When the development team don’t know much about users. The team may not have done any field research in the past and want to milk this session for all its worth. This shows itself when the participant is interrupted mid-task and asked questions about the way they do this task at home. or when the marketing lead asks you to shoe-horn in a shopping list of questions during a task. As a consequence, the research falls between two stools: It’s neither an interview nor a usability test. Another situation where this can happen is when you have a particularly loquacious participant who wants to engage the moderator in conversation, rather than do the tasks. The participant will continue to look over to the moderator for reassurance and try to make eye contact. The best approach is to prevent this problem from happening in the first place. Adjust your body language to be more of an observer than an inter- viewer. Position yourself so you are behind and to one side of the participant. If you sense the participant looking toward you, pretend to take notes and decline the offer of eye contact. Also make it clear to the development team that you’ll run a post-test interview to get an overall assessment and encourage comments regarding topics not raised during the session, and that’s where you’ll cover their shop- ping list of questions. Soliciting Opinions and Preferences This final mistake is one we see often in people who are new to moderating a usability test. This is because they have confused usability testing with \nmarket research. They think their role is to solicit opinions rather than to observe behavior. The way this manifests itself in a test is the moderator will ask the partic- ipant to compare different designs to see which one they prefer, or they will continually ask the participant if they like or dislike some design feature. Usability testing isn’t about finding out what users like, but rather what works best for them. How to Continuously Improve as a Test Moderator These mistakes almost always occur in novice test moderators as they earn their spurs. But even experienced test moderators make these kinds of mis- take during a usability test. The best way to avoid mistakes is to continuously reflect on your own moderating skills. After each usability test, look back over the recordings, especially sessions that you feel went particularly well or badly. Make it part of your personal development to identify three things you can build on or that you could have done better. THINK LIKE A UX RESEARCHER • It’s difficult to assess one’s own competence as a usability test moderator. We mention listening back to a participant record- ing, but it can be hard to be objective. one way around this is to use the five mistakes as a checklist as you reflect on your perfor- mance. Another approach, but more challenging to listen to, is to ask for critical feedback from usability test observers after each participant session. • Some members of development teams misunderstand the purpose of a usability test and expect you to solicit opinions and preferences. They may want you to ask if the participant likes the design or prefers one version over another. How would you manage that expectation? ( Continued ) \n• We’ve run tests in the past where it’s clearly the test partici- pant’s style to continually ask questions. It’s how they think aloud. “Where’s the link for the basket? oh, there it is. But how do I find out the shipping costs? Maybe I need to click the basket icon. Where’s the basket icon?” You get the idea. These can be one of the more challenging participants to moderate because the “boomerang” technique can become wearing after a while (both for you and the participant). When is it acceptable to ignore a participant’s question and treat the question like a statement? How could you practice dealing with a participant like this? • We discourage you from explaining the design to the participant but of course you’ll need to step in if the participant gets totally lost or confused. At what point should you step in to bring a participant back on track? How “lost” do participants need to get for you to know this is really a problem and not one that they can solve themselves? • Imagine you have a test participant who seems more interested in turning the session into an interview than in doing the test tasks. He turns away from the screen, faces you and tells you anecdotes tenuously related to what he’s meant to be doing. How would you bring the participant back on track?
