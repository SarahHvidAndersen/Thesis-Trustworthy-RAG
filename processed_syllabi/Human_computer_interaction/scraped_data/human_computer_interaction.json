The emphasis in the course will be on the application of theories and methods from cognitive science to the field of HCI. Students will learn to apply methods from cognitive science in the analysis, and evaluation of information technology designed for human use, and they will learn how to apply theories from cognitive science to inform the design of new human-computer systems.\nThe course includes an introduction to human-computer interaction from the perspective of cognitive science. The course will focus on how knowledge of human cognitive processes, and different methodologies can inform the evaluation and design of information technology systems intended for human use. It will also discuss opportunities and limitations of using artificial systems in direct interaction with humans.\nThis course builds on earlier theoretical and methodological courses in cognitive science, to enable students to understand basic design principles used in the development of information technology systems.\nAcademic objectives:\nIn the evaluation of the student’s performance, emphasis is placed on the extent to which the student is able to:\nKnowledge:\n- explain common theories in human-computer interaction\n- describe opportunities and limitations of human-computer interaction.\nSkills:\n- apply statistical tools and measurement techniques to evaluate information technology systems with respect to usability and user experience\n- apply theories of cognitive function in the design of new information technology systems\n- discuss implications of information technology systems for human cognition and behavior.\nCompetences:\n- make informed suggestions for the design and use of human interaction systems.\nSee all\nECTS\n10\nLevel\nMaster\nSemester\nMA, 2nd semester\nLanguage of instruction\nEnglish\nType of course\nOrdinary\nPrimary programme\nMaster's Degree Programme in Cognitive Science\nDepartment\nSchool of Communication and Culture\nFaculty\nArts\nLocation\nAarhus\nSTADS UVA code\n147222U008\nCopy UVA code\nTeaching\nForms of instruction\nLecture and classroom instruction\nInstructor\nSee all\nMarc Malmdorf Andersen\nInstitut for Kultur og Samfund - Interacting Minds (IMC)\nComments on the form of instruction\nRead more\nLectures and classroom instruction\nLanguage of instruction:\nThe rules governing language of exam and teaching are stated in section 2.1 of the academic regulations.\nLiterature\nRead more\nWill be announced on Brightspace at the start of the semester.\nExamination\nForms of examination\nTake-home assignment (Assign)  and  oral\nForm of co-examination\nInternal co-examination\nAssessment\n7-point grading scale\nTake-home assignment (Assign)\nPermitted exam aids\nNot specified\nOral\nPermitted exam aids\nNot specified\nDuration\n30 minute(s)\nComments\nRead more\nOrdinary exam and re-examination:\nThe examination consists of an individual oral exam based on a synopsis. The synopsis can be written individually or in a group up to 4 students.\nLength of the synopsis:\nFor 1 student: 4-7 standard pages.\nFor 2 students: 8-14 standard pages\nFor 3 students: 12-21 standard pages\nFor 4 students: 16-28 standard pages\nThe synopsis must be submitted in the Digital Exam system before the deadline set in the examination plan.\nThe oral exam is based on the student’s presentation of the synopsis followed by a dialogue between the student and the examiner in which the rest of the course syllabus is included.\nDuration: 30 minutes (including assessment).\nThe assessment is based on an overall evaluation of the synopsis and the oral presentation.",
