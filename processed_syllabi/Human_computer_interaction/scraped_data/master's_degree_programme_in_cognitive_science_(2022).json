Description of qualifications:Purpose:The purpose of the course is to introduce students to the field of human-computer interaction. The emphasis in the course will be on the application of theories and methods from cognitive science to the field of HCI. Students will learn to apply methods from cognitive science in the analysis, and evaluation of information technology designed for human use, and they will learn how to apply theories from cognitive science to inform the design of new human-computer systems.The course includes an introduction to human-computer interaction from the perspective of cognitive science. The course will focus on how knowledge of human cognitive processes, and different methodologies can inform the evaluation and design of information technology systems intended for human use. It will also discuss opportunities and limitations of using artificial systems in direct interaction with humans.This course builds on earlier theoretical and methodological courses in cognitive science, to enable students to understand basic design principles used in the development of information technology systems.Academic objectives:In the evaluation of the student’s performance, emphasis is placed on the extent to which the student is able to:Knowledge:- explain common theories in human-computer interaction- describe opportunities and limitations of human-computer interaction.Skills:- apply statistical tools and measurement techniques to evaluate information technology systems with respect to usability and user experience- apply theories of cognitive function in the design of new information technology systems- discuss implications of information technology systems for human cognition and behavior.Competences:- make informed suggestions for the design and use of human interaction systems.

The compulsory commencement of studies exam will be held before the end of September on the first semester of the Master’s degree programme.The exam generates 0 ECTS credits and is a pass/fail internal examination with no co-examiner. Two attempts to pass this exam are allowed. First-semester students will be registered for the exam automatically. The result will be posted in the student’s self-service system (mit.au.dk). Students who do not pass their first examination attempt will be registered automatically for their second attempt.The result of the second attempt will be posted in the student’s self-service system (mit.au.dk) no later than 28 September. Students who fail both their first and second attempt will be withdrawn from their degree programme with immediate effect and without further warning. Students may apply for advance approval of degree programme elements which are subsequently completed at another university or institution of higher education in Denmark or abroad. An approved application for advance approval of transfer credit obligates the student to document the results – both passed and failed degree programme elements, as soon as these marks are available. The board of studies may – if necessary – procure the necessary documentation directly. The student will then receive transfer credit for the passed degree programme elements.Applications for advance approval of transfer credit and submission of documentation for completed degree programme elements with a view to registration of transfer credit must take place in accordance with the rules published on the study portal. In addition, the board of studies may approve applications for transfer credit for degree programme elements which have been completed at an institution of higher education in Denmark or abroad.When the board of studies has approved the credit transfer of a passed course/course element from an institution of higher education in Denmark or abroad, credit must be transferred as ‘Passed’. If the course element in question is assessed in accordance with the 7-point grading scale at both institutions, the assessment is transferred with the grade given, cf. the Degree Programme Order and the Examination Order. Registering for compulsory courses, elective courses and examsRegistering for compulsory courses and elective courses:Students will be registered automatically for teaching in compulsory courses in the order of semesters prescribed in the academic regulations. Students are responsible for ensuring that they are always registered correctly for courses and elective courses. Students must register for and (when necessary) prioritise elective courses by the set deadline, which can be found on the study portal. After this deadline, elective courses become a compulsory part of the student’s degree programme and cannot be changed. Students who stick to the prescribed curriculum will be given priority when places are assigned for compulsory courses. After the deadline for registration, places can only be assigned to students if there is room in the classroom, and only until the start of the semester.Selection criteria for elective coursesThere may be a limit to the number of students admitted to elective courses, and the creation of such courses is contingent on the number of students who register for them. The criteria for allocating places on elective courses which only admit a limited number of students are stated on the study portal. (studerende.au.dk/arts). Registering for and withdrawing from ordinary exams and re-examinations:Students will be registered automatically for ordinary exams in compulsory courses. Students are responsible for ensuring that they are always registered correctly for exams. Students are responsible for registering for re-examinations by the set deadline, which can be found on the study portal and in the exam plan. Students can only register for re-examinations if they have already tried to pass the ordinary exam before the re-examination. Students can withdraw from exams using the self-service system at mitstudie.au.dk, following the procedure described on the study portal. Students cannot withdraw from exams after the deadline, and the failure to take part in an exam for which they are registered will count as a failed attempt to pass it. The deadlines for registration and withdrawal can be found on the study portal and in the exam plan. Students cannot withdraw from the Master’s thesis. Forms of exam for ordinary exams and re-examinationsThe form of exam for ordinary exams and re-examinations is stated in the academic regulations. The ordinary form of exam is offered immediately after courses have been taught.Students taking exams in the re-examination period will be examined using the form of re-examination that has been specified. If the ordinary exam and the re-examination both use the same form of exam, students are entitled to apply for a re-examination in the ordinary exam period immediately after the course teaching has been completed. Deadlines are stated on the study portal. Students should not expect any requests submitted after the deadline to be granted. Students can choose between the specified forms of exam for their Master’s thesis. Options for project-oriented courses are stated in the description of the individual study element. It is possible to take project placement with more than one project host if it is deemed to live up to all requirements for project placement. Complaints about exams should be submitted to the university. For the application to be processed, it must be made in writing. The complaint must state both the reason for the complaint and what the complainant expects to achieve. Complaints about exams must be submitted within fourteen days after the deadline for the publication of exam results, cf. the Examination Order.
