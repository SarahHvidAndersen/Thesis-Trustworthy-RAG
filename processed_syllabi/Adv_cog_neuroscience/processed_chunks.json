But why? In Part II of this book, we discussed various types of motor responses. At the lowest level are unconscious refl exes initiated by sensory stimulation—dilation of the pupils when the lights go out, sudden removal of the foot from a thumbtack, and so on. At the highest level are conscious movements initiated by the neurons of the frontal lobe—for example, the fi nger movements that tap this text into the computer. Voluntary movements are incited to occur, or motivated , in order to satisfy a need. The motivation can be very abstract (the “need” to go sailing on a warm and breezy summer afternoon), but it can also be quite concrete (the need to go to the bathroom when your bladder is full). Motivation can be thought of as a driving force on behavior",

    "chunk_text": ". Motivation can be thought of as a driving force on behavior. By analogy, consider the driving force on sodium ions to cross the neuronal membrane (an odd analogy, perhaps, but not for a neuroscience text). As we learned back in Chapters 3 and 4, ionic driving force depends on a number of fators, including the concentration of the ion on both sides of the membrane and the electrical membrane potential. Variations in driving force make transmembrane ionic current in a particular direction more or less likely. But the driving force alone does not determine whether the current fl ows; the transmembrane movement of ions also requires the appropriate gated ion channels to be opened and capable of conducting the current. Of course, human behavior will never be described by anything as simple as Ohm’s law. Still, it is useful to consider that the probability and direction of a behavior will vary with the level of driving force to peform that behavior. And while motivation may be required for a certain behavior, it does not guarantee that behavior. The membrane analogy also allows us to highlight the fact that a crucial part of the control of behavior is to appropriately gate the expression of different motivated actions that have confl icting goals—tapping on the computer keyboard versus spending the afternoon sailing, for example. Despite tangible progress in recent years, neuroscience cannot yet prvide a detailed explanation for why the sailing expedition was abandoned in favor of writing this chapter. Nonetheless, much has been learned about what motivates certain behaviors that are basic to survival. THE HYPOTHALAMUS, HOMEOSTASIS, AND MOTIVATED BEHAVIOR The hypothalamus and homeostasis were introduced in Chapter 15.

Although homeostatic refl exes occur at many levels of the nervous system, the hypothalamus plays a key role in the regulation of body temperature, fl uid balance, and energy balance. The hypothalamic regulation of homeostasis starts with sensory tranduction. A regulated parameter (e.g., temperature) is measured by speciaized sensory neurons, and deviations from the optimal range are detected by neurons concentrated in the periventricular zone of the hypothalamus. These neurons then orchestrate an integrated response to bring the paraeter back to its optimal value. The response generally has three components: 1. Humoral response : Hypothalamic neurons respond to sensory signals by stimulating or inhibiting the release of pituitary hormones into the bloodstream.

Somatic motor response : Hypothalamic neurons (particularly within the lateral hypothalamus) respond to sensory signals by inciting an appropriate somatic motor behavioral response. You are cold, dehydrated, and depleted of energy. The appropriate hmoral and visceromotor responses kick in automatically. You shiver, blood is shunted away from the body surface, urine production is inhibited, body fat reserves are mobilized, and so on. But the fastest and most effective way to correct these disturbances of brain homeostasis is to actively seek or generate warmth by moving, to drink water, and to eat. These are exaples of motivated behaviors generated by the somatic motor system, and they are incited to occur by the activity of the lateral hypothalamus",

Our goal in this chapter is to explore the neural basis for this type of motivation. To illustrate, we will concentrate on a subject dear to our hearts: eating. THE LONG-TERM REGULATION OF FEEDING BEHAVIOR As you know, even a brief interruption in a person’s oxygen supply can lead to serious brain damage and death. You may be surprised to learn that the brain’s requirement for food, in the form of glucose, is no less urgent. Only a few minutes of glucose deprivation will lead to a loss of consciousness, eventually followed by death if glucose is not restored. While the external environment normally provides a constant source of oxygen, the availabiity of food is less assured. Thus, complex internal regulatory mechanisms have evolved to store energy in the body so that it is available when needed. One primary reason we are motivated to eat is to keep these reserves at a level suffi cient to ensure that there will not be an energy shortfall. Energy Balance The body’s energy stores are replenished during and immediately after consuming a meal. This condition, in which the blood is fi lled with ntrients, is called the prandial state (from the Latin word for “breakfast”). During this time, energy is stored in two forms: glycogen and triglyceides (Figure 16.1). Glycogen reserves have a fi nite capacity, and they are found mainly in the liver and skeletal muscle. Triglyceride reserves are found in adipose (fat) tissue, and they have a virtually unlimited capcity. The assembly of macromolecules such as glycogen and triglycerides from simple precursors is called anabolism , or anabolic metabolism",

During the fasting condition between meals, called the postabsorptive state , stored glycogen and triglycerides are broken down to provide the body with a continuous supply of the molecules used as fuel for cellular metabolism (glucose for all cells, and fatty acids and ketones for all cells other than neurons). The process of breaking down complex macromoecules is called catabolism , or catabolic metabolism; it is the opposite of anabolism. The system is in proper balance when energy reserves are rplenished at the same average rate that they are expended. If the intake and storage of energy consistently exceed the usage, the amount of body fat, or adiposity , increases, eventually resulting in obesity .

Figure 16.2 summarizes the concept of energy balance and body fat. For the system to stay in balance, there must be some means of reglating feeding behavior, based on the size of the energy reserves and their rate of replenishment. In recent decades, research has made substatial progress in understanding the various means by which this regultion occurs—and none too soon, because eating disorders and obesity are widespread health problems. It is now apparent that there are multiple regulatory mechanisms, some acting over a long period of time to maitain the body’s fat reserves, and others acting over a shorter time period to regulate meal size and frequency.

Hormonal and Hypothalamic Regulation of Body Fat and Feeding The study of the homeostatic regulation of feeding behavior has a long history, but the pieces of the puzzle have only recently fallen into place. As we will see, feeding is stimulated when neurons in the hypothalamus detect a drop in the level of a hormone released by fat cells. These hypthalamic cells are concentrated in the periventricular zone; those neurons that incite feeding behavior are in the lateral hypothalamus. Body Fat and Food Consumption.

However, once free access to food is restored, the animal overeats until the original level of body fat has fully returned. It also works the other way around. Animals force fed in order to gain fat mass, once given the chance to regulate their own diet, eat less until their fat levels return to normal. The heavy rat’s behavioral response is obviously not a refl ection of vanity; it is a mechanism for maitaining energy homeostasis. The idea that the brain monitors the amount of body fat and acts to “defend” this energy store against perturbations, fi rst proposed in 1953 by British scientist Gordon Kennedy, is called the lipostatic hypothesis . The connection between body fat and feeding behavior suggests that there must be communication from adipose tissue to the brain. A blooborne hormonal signal was immediately suspected, and this suspicion was confi rmed in the 1960s by Douglas Coleman and his colleagues at the Jackson Laboratories in Bar Harbor, Maine, working with genetically obese mice. The DNA of one strain of an obese mouse lacked both copies of a gene called ob (these mice are therefore called ob/ob mice). Coleman hypothesized that the protein encoded by the ob gene is the hormone teling the brain that fat reserves are normal. Thus, in the ob/ob mice that lack this hormone, the brain is fooled into thinking that the fat reserves are low, and the animals are abnormally motivated to eat. To test this idea, a parabiosis experiment was performed. Parabiosis is the long-term anatomical and physiological union of two animals, as in Siamese twins. Fusion can also be achieved surgically, thereby resulting in parabiosed animals sharing a common blood supply. Coleman and his colleagues found that when ob/ob animals were parabiosed with normal mice, their feeding behavior and obesity were greatly reduced, as if the missing homone had been replaced (Figure 16.4)",

In 1994, a group of scientists led by Jeffrey Friedman at Rockefeller University fi nally isolated the protein, which they called leptin (from the Greek for “slender”). Treating ob/ob mice with leptin completely reverses the obesity and the eating disorder (Figure 16.5). The hormone leptin, released by adpocytes (fat cells), regulates body mass by acting directly on neurons of the hypothalamus that decrease appetite and increase energy expenditure.

Ranson of Northwestern University made the seminal discovery, published in 1940, that small lesions made on both sides of a rat’s hypothalamus can have large effects on subsequent feeding behavior and adiposity. Bilateral lesions of the lateral hypothalamus caused anorexia , a severely diminished apptite for food. In contrast, bilateral lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamus caused the animals to overeat and become obese (Figure 16.6). This basic scenario applies to humans as well. Anorexia caused by damage to the laeral hypothalamus is commonly referred to as the lateral hypothalamic syndrome ; overeating and obesity caused by lesions to the ventromedial hypothalamus is called the ventromedial hypothalamic syndrome . O F S P E C I A L I N T E R E S T BOX 16.1 The Starving Brains of the Obese L ike the ob/ob mouse, humans lacking leptin crave food, have slowed metabolism, and become morbidly obese. For these individuals, leptin replacement therapy can be a “miracle cure” (Figure A). While mutations affecting the leptin gene are rare, there is evidence for a genetic basis for many forms of human obesity. The hereditability of obsity is equivalent to that of height and greater than that of many other conditions, including heart disease and breast cancer. Many genes are involved, and the search is on to discover them. Obesity is a major human health problem. In the United States, two-thirds of the population is overweight, and milions are morbidly obese. Many obese people experience intense cravings for food but at the same time have slowed metabolism. In the case of leptin defi ciency, the brain and body respond as if the person is starving, despite massive obesity. Leptin offered tremendous promise as a treatment for obesity. By supplementing leptin, the logic went, the brain could be fooled into decreasing appetite and increasing mtabolism",

By supplementing leptin, the logic went, the brain could be fooled into decreasing appetite and increasing mtabolism. Unfortunately, other than the rare individuals who congenitally lack the hormone, most obese patients have failed to respond to leptin therapy. Indeed, many have been found to have abnormally elevated blood levels of leptin. It appears that the problem for these patients stems from dcreased sensitivity of brain neurons to the leptin circulating in the blood. The problem can arise from decreased pentration of the leptin through the blood-brain barrier, reduced expression of the leptin receptor in the neurons of the periventricular hypothalamus, or altered CNS responses to changes in hypothalamic activity. Intensive efforts are now underway to identify drug targets in the feeding circuits of the brain that are downstream of leptin.

Destruction of the lateral hypothalamus leaves the animals inappropriately satiated, so they do not eat; destruction of the ventromedial hypothalamus leaves the animals insatiable, so they overeat. However, this “dual center” model has proven to be overly simplistic. We now have a better idea why hypothalamic lesions affect body fat and feeing behavior; it has much to do with leptin signaling. The Effects of Elevated Leptin Levels on the Hypothalamus. Although still sketchy in places, a picture is beginning to emerge of how the hypthalamus participates in body fat homeostasis. First, let’s consider the response when leptin levels are high, as they are right after several days of “forced” holiday feasting. Circulating leptin molecules, released into the bloodstream by fat cells, activate leptin receptors on neurons of the arcuate nucleus of the hypthalamus, which lies near the base of the third ventricle (Figure 16.7). The arcuate neurons that are activated by a rise in blood leptin levels contain peptide neurotransmitters called MSH and CART , and the levels of these peptides in the brain vary in proportion to the level of leptin in the blood. (To explain the alphabet soup: Peptides are often named by their fi rst discovered function, and these names can lead to confusion when other roles are recognized. Therefore, neuropeptides are usually referred to siply by their abbreviations. For the record, MSH stands for alpha-melnocyte - stimulating hormone , and CART stands for cocainand ampheamine-regulated transcript . Like other neurotransmitters, the functional role of these molecules depends on the circuits in which they participate.) Before going any further, let’s take a moment to consider the body’s itegrated response to excessive adiposity, high leptin levels, and activation of the MSH/CART neurons of the arcuate nucleus. The humoral response consists of increased secretion of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) (see Table 15.1 in Chapter 15)",

The viscermotor response increases the tone of the sympathetic division of the ANS, which also raises metabolic rate, in part by raising body temperature. The somatic motor response decreases feeding behavior. The MSH/CART nerons of the arcuate nucleus project their axons directly to the regions of the nervous system that orchestrate this coordinated response (Figure 16.8). MSH/CART neurons trigger the humoral response by the activating neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, which in turn causes the release of the hypophysiotropic hormones that reulate the secretion of TSH and ACTH from the anterior pituitary (see Chapter 15). The paraventricular nucleus also controls the activity of the sympathetic division of the ANS with direct axonal projections to nerons in the lower brain stem and to preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord. Additionally, there is also a direct path for arcuate control of the sympathetic response: The MSH and CART neurons themselves project axons directly down to the intermediolateral gray matter of the spinal cord.

We will take a closer look at the lateral hypothalamus in a moment. The injection of MSH or CART into the brain mimics the response to elevated leptin levels. Thus, these are said to be anorectic peptides ; they diminish appetite. The injection of drugs that block the actions of these peptides increases feeding behavior. These fi ndings suggest that MSH and CART normally participate in the regulation of energy baance, in part by acting as the brain’s own appetite suppressants. The Effects of Decreased Leptin Levels on the Hypothalamus. In adition to turning off the responses mediated by MSH/CART neurons, a fall in leptin levels actually stimulates another type of arcuate nucleus neuron. These neurons contain their own mix of peptides: NPY ( neurpeptide Y ) and AgRP ( agouti-related peptide ). The NPY/AgRP neurons of the arcuate nucleus also have connections with the paraventricular nucleus and the lateral hypothalamus (Figure 16.9), and the effects of 559 CHAPTER 16 MOTIVATION Third ventricle Lateral hypothalamic area Paraventricular nucleus Stimulate feeding behavior Inhibit secretion of hypophysiotropic hormones controlling ACTH and TSH NPY/AgRP neurons of arcuate nucleus FIGURE 16.9 The response to decreased leptin levels.

NPY and AgRP inhibit the secrtion of TSH and ACTH, they activate the parasympathetic division of the ANS, and they stimulate feeding behavior. They are therefore referred to as orexigenic peptides (from the Greek for “appetite”). The brain’s coodinated response to changing leptin levels is summarized in Figure 16.10. AgRP and MSH are literally antagonistic neurotransmitters. Both peptides bind to the MC4 receptor on postsynaptic neurons in the hypthalamus. MSH activates the receptor and AgRP inhibits it. Activation of MC4 receptors on lateral hypothalamic neurons inhibits feeding; inhiiting the receptors stimulates feeding (Figure 16.11).

Modern experiments using optogenetic methods to stimulate and silence specifi c types of neurons (see Chapter 4) reveal that both neurons intrinsic to the lateral hypothalamus and axons passing through the lateral hypothalmus contribute to the motivation of feeding behavior. Let’s fi rst concentrate on the role of the neurons within the lateral hypothalamic area. One group of neurons in the lateral hypothalamus that receives direct input from the leptin-sensitive cells of the arcuate nucleus has yet another peptide neurotransmitter called MCH ( melanin-concentrating hormone ). These cells have extremely widespread connections in the brain, including direct monsynaptic innervation of most of the cerebral cortex. The cortex is involved in organizing and initiating goal-directed behaviors, such as raiding the refrierator. The MCH system is in a strategic position to inform the cortex of leptin levels in the blood and therefore could contribute signifi cantly to motivating the search for food. Supporting this idea, the injection of MCH into the brain stimulates feeding behavior.

A second population of lateral hypothalamic neurons with widespread cortical connections has been identifi ed, containing another peptide called orexin . These cells also receive direct inputs from the arcuate nucleus. As is the case for MCH, and as the name suggests, orexin is an orexigenic petide (i.e., it stimulates feeding behavior). The levels of both MCH and orexin rise in the brain when leptin levels in the blood fall. These two peptides are complementary, not redundant. For example, orexin promotes meal initition, whereas MCH prolongs consumption. Additionally, orexin, also called hypocretin , plays a very important role in the regulation of wakefulness. As we will learn in Chapter 19, gene mutations that disable orexin (hypcretin) signaling not only lead to weight loss but also to excessive daytime sleepiness. Perhaps it is obvious that sleep inhibits feeding behavior; after all, it is diffi cult to eat when you are asleep. However, you might be suprised to learn that insomnia and obesity also often go together. Orexin (hypocretin) provides an interesting link between these conditions. To conclude this section, let’s briefl y summarize hypothalamic rsponses to blood leptin levels. Remember, leptin levels rise when body fat is increased, and they fall when body fat is decreased: • A rise in leptin levels stimulates the release of MSH and CART from arcuate nucleus neurons. These anorectic peptides act on the brain, in part by activating the MC4 receptor, to inhibit feeding behavior and increase metabolism. • A fall in leptin levels stimulates the release of NPY and AgRP from arcuate nucleus neurons, and the release of MCH and orexin from nerons in the lateral hypothalamic area. These orexigenic peptides act on the brain to stimulate feeding behavior and decrease metabolism",

These are examples of what we are calling the short-term regulation of feeding behavior. A useful way to think about this regulatory process is to imagine that the drive to eat, which may vary rather slowly with the rise and fall of leptin, is increased by orexigenic signals generated in response to a priod of fasting, and inhibited by satiety signals that occur when we eat and begin the process of digestion (i.e., the prandial period). These stiety signals both terminate the meal and inhibit feeding for some time afterward. During this postabsorptive (fasting) period, the satiety signals slowly dissipate, and the orexigenic signals build, until the drive to eat again takes over (Figure 16.12). We will use this model to explore the bilogical basis for the short-term regulation of feeding behavior. Appetite, Eating, Digestion, and Satiety You have awakened in the morning after a long night’s slumber. You come to the kitchen to fi nd pancakes cooking on the stove; when they are ready, you enthusiastically eat them until you’re satiated. Your body’s reactions during this process can be divided into three phases: cephalic, gastric, and substrate (also called the intestinal phase ): 1. Cephalic phase . The sight and smell of the pancakes trigger a number of physiological processes that anticipate the arrival of breakfast. The parsympathetic and enteric divisions of the ANS are activated, causing the secretion of saliva into your mouth and digestive juices into your stomach. 2. Gastric phase . These responses grow much more intense, when you start chewing, swallowing, and fi lling your stomach with food. 3. Substrate phase",

As your stomach fi lls and the partially digested pacakes move into your intestines, nutrients begin to be absorbed into your bloodstream. As you pass through these phases, signals that motivate consumption of the pancakes are replaced by those that terminate your meal. Let’s look at some of the orexigenic and satiety signals that shape eating behavior during a meal (Box 16.2). Food consumption Satiety signals Orexigenic signals Feeding behavior Time Food Meal Meal Orexigenic and satiety signals ▲ FIGURE 16.12 A hypothetical model for the short-term regulation of feeding behavior. This graph shows a possible means of regulating food consumption by satiety signals. Satiety signals rise in response to feeding. When satiety signals are high, food consumption is inhibited. When the satiety signals fall to zero, the inhibition is eliminated, and food consumption ensues. 563 CHAPTER 16 MOTIVATION O F S P E C I A L I N T E R E S T BOX 16.2 Marijuana and the Munchies A well-known consequence of marijuana intoxiction is stimulation of appetite, an effect known by users as “the munchies.” The active ingredient in marijuana is D 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which alters neuronal funtions by stimulating a receptor called cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1). CB1 receptors are abundant throughout the brain, so it is overly simplistic to view these receptors as serving only appetite regulation. Nevertheless, “medical marijuana” is often prescribed (where legal) as a means to stimulate apetite in patients with chronic diseases, such as cancer and AIDS. A compound that inhibits CB1 receptors, rimonabant, was also developed as an appetite suppressant. However, human drug trials had to be discontinued because of pschiatric side effects",

However, human drug trials had to be discontinued because of pschiatric side effects. Although this fi nding underscores the fact that these receptors do much more than mediate the munchies, it is still of interest to know where in the brain CB1 receptors act to stimulate appetite. Not surprisingly, the CB1 receptors are associated with neurons in many regions of the brain that control feeding, such as the hypothalamus, and some of the orexigenic effects of THC are related to changing the activity of these neurons. However, neuroscientists were surprised to learn in 2014 that much of the appetite stimultion comes from enhancing the sense of smell, at least in mice. Collaborative research conducted by neuroscientists in France and Spain, countries incidentally known for their apreciation of good tastes and smells, revealed that activation of CB1 receptors in the olfactory bulb increases odor detetion and is necessary for the increase in food intake stimlated in hungry mice by cannabinoids. In Chapter 8, we discussed how smells activate neurons in the olfactory bulb which, in turn, relay information to the ofactory cortex. The cortex also sends feedback projections to the bulb that synapse on inhibitory interneurons called graule cells . By activating the inhibitory granule cells, this feeback from the cortex dampens ascending olfactory activity. These corticofugal synapses use glutamate as a neurotranmitter. The brain’s own endocannabinoids (anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol) are synthesized under fasting condtions, and they inhibit glutamate release by acting on CB1 receptors on the corticofugal axon terminals. Reducing graule cell activation by glutamate in the bulb has the net effect of enhancing the sense of smell (Figure A)",

Until recently, scientists believed that hunger was merely the asence of satiety. This view changed in 1999 with the discovery of a peptide called ghrelin . Ghrelin was isolated originally as a factor that stimlates growth hormone release. However, researchers quickly found that the peptide is highly concentrated in the stomach and is released into the bloodstream when the stomach is empty. Your “growling” stomach releases ghrelin (“ghrrrrrrrelin”). Intravenous administration of ghrlin strongly stimulates appetite and food consumption by activating the NPY/AgRP-containing neurons of the arcuate nucleus (the same neurons activated by a drop in leptin in the bloodstream). Gastric Distension. We all know what it is like to feel “full” after a big meal; as you might expect, the stretching of the stomach wall is a powerful satiety signal. The stomach wall is richly innervated by mechanosensory axons, and most of these ascend to the brain via the vagus nerve",

Recall from the appendix to Chapter 7 that the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) contains a mixture of sensory and motor axons, originates in the medulla, and meanders through much of the body cavity ( vagus is from the Latin for “wandering”). The vagal sensory axons activate neurons in the ncleus of the solitary tract in the medulla. These signals inhibit feeding behavior. You may recall that the nucleus of the solitary tract has been metioned several times in different contexts. The gustatory nucleus, which receives direct sensory input from the taste buds (see Chapter 8), is actally a subdivision of the nucleus of the solitary tract. The nucleus of the solitary tract is also an important center in the control of the ANS (see Chapter 15). Now we fi nd that the same nucleus receives visceral sesory input from the vagus nerve. It is easy to see how a nucleus with such widespread connections could serve as an important integration center in the control of feeding and metabolism. As you know, satiety induced by a full stomach can be delayed quite a while if what you are eating is tasty enough. Cholecystokinin. In the 1970s, researchers discovered that the adminitration of the peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) inhibits meal frequency and size. CCK is present in some of the cells that line the intestines and some of the neurons of the enteric nervous system. It is released in rsponse to stimulation of the intestines by certain types of food, especially fatty ones. The major action of CCK as a satiety peptide is exerted on the vagal sensory axons. CCK acts synergistically with gastric distension to inhibit feeding behavior (Figure 16.13). Curiously, CCK, like many other gastrointestinal peptides, is also contained within selected populations of neurons within the central nervous system (CNS). Insulin",

Released into the bloodstream by the cells of the pancreas, insulin is a vitally important hormone (Box 16.3). Although glucose is always readily transported into neurons, glucose transport into the other cells of the body requires insulin . This means that insulin is important for anabolic metabolism when glucose is transported into liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose cells for storage as well as for catabolic metabolism when the glucose liberated from storage sites is taken up as fuel by the other cells of the body. Thus, the level of glucose in the blood is tightly regulated by the level of insulin: Blood glucose levels are elevated when CCK Gastric distension Vagus nerve Satiety Nucleus of the solitary tract ▲ FIGURE 16.13 The synergistic action of gastric distension and CCK on feeding behavior.

After a meal, glucose levels in the blood rise. To be used by the cells of the body, glucose must be shuttled across the plasma membrane by specialized proteins called glucose transporters . In all cells other than neurons, the insertion of glucose transporters into the membrane occurs when insulin binds to cell surface inslin receptors. Thus, for the glucose to be utilized or stored by these cells, a rise in blood insulin levels must accompany the rise in blood glucose levels.

In the clinical condition known as diabetes mellitus , defects in insulin production and release, or in the cellular response to insulin, prevent the normal reation to elevated glucose. The consequence is elevated blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) because the glucose absorbed from the intestines cannot be taken up by the cells of the body (other than neurons). The excess glucose passes to the urine, making it sweet. Indeed, the disorder’s name is from the Latin for “siphoning honey.” An effective treatment for some types of diabetes mellitus is hypodermic injections of insulin. However, this treatment has risks. An overdose of insulin causes blood glucose leels to plummet (hypoglycemia), starving the neurons of the brain. The resulting condition is called insulin shock , charaterized by sweating, tremor, anxiety, dizziness, and double vision. If it is not corrected promptly, these early signs are followed by delirium, convulsions, and loss of consciouness. The sudden neurological response to hypoglycemia illustrates how vital energy balance is for the normal funtioning of the brain (Figure A). Figure A A PET image superimposed on an MRI image of the human body. The hot colors (red to yellow) show regions with high glucose utilization. Note that the brain, even at rest, has a very high demand for fuel. When glucose leels in the blood fall, as they do during insulin shock, brain functions are very rapidly lost. (Source: Siemens Healthcare and Professor Marcus Raichle, Washington University, St. Louis.) insulin levels are reduced; blood glucose levels fall when insulin levels rise. Insulin release by the pancreas is controlled in a number of ways (Figure 16.14). Consider the example of your pancake breakfast. During the cephalic phase, when you are anticipating food, the parasympthetic innervation of the pancreas (delivered by the vagus nerve) stimlates the cells to release insulin",

In response, blood glucose levels fall slightly, and this change, detected by the neurons of the brain, increases your drive to eat (in part, by activation of the NPY/AgRP neurons of the 566 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR arcuate nucleus). During the gastric phase, when food enters your stoach, insulin secretion is stimulated further by gastrointestinal hormones, such as CCK. Insulin release is maximal when the food is fi nally absorbed in the intestines and blood glucose levels rise, during the substrate phase. Indeed, the primary stimulus for insulin release is increased blood glucose levels. This rise in insulin, coupled with the elevated blood glucose levels, is a satiety signal and causes you to stop eating. In contrast to the other satiety signals we’ve discussed, which commnicate with the brain mainly via the vagus nerve, bloodborne insulin acts to inhibit feeding behavior by acting directly on the arcuate and ventrmedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. It appears that insulin acts in much the same way as leptin to regulate feeding behavior. WHY DO WE EAT? We have talked about the signals that motivate feeding behavior, but we still have not discussed what that really means in psychological terms. Obviously, we eat because we like food. This aspect of motivation is hedonic: It feels good, so we do it. We derive pleasure from the taste, smell, sight, and feel of food and from the act of eating. However, we also eat because we are hungry and we want food. This aspect of motivation can be considered as a drive reduction : satisfying a craving. A reasonable assumption is that “liking” and “wanting” are two aspects of a unifi ed process; after all, we typically crave food that we like. However, research on humans and animals suggests that liking and wanting are mediated by separate circuits in the brain",

Reinforcement and Reward In experiments performed in the early 1950s, James Olds and Peter Milner at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, implanted electrodes in the brains of rats to investigate the effect of electrical brain stimultion on the animals’ behavior. The animals were allowed to freely eplore a box about 3 ft 2 . Every time the rats wandered into one corner of the box, the researchers delivered brain stimulation. They observed that when the electrodes were lodged in certain parts of the brain, the stimultion appeared to cause the animals to spend all their time in the corner that led to stimulation. In a brilliant twist on this experiment, Olds and Milner set up a new box with a lever on one side that, when depressed, caused the brain to be stimulated (Figure 16.15). At fi rst, the rats wadered about the box, stepping on the lever occasionally by accident. But before long, the rats were pressing the lever repeatedly to receive the electrical stimulation. This behavior is called electrical self-stimultion . Sometimes the rats would become so involved in pressing the lever that they would shun food and water, stopping only after collapsing from exhaustion (Box 16.4). Electrical self-stimulation appeared to provide a reward that reiforced the habit to press the lever. By systematically moving the stimlating electrode to different regions of the brain, researchers were able to identify specifi c sites that were reinforcing. It became apparent that the most effective sites for self-stimulation fell along the trajectory of dopminergic axons arising in the ventral tegmental area, projecting through the lateral hypothalamus to several forebrain regions (Figure 16.16)",

Obviously, this is not nomally feasible or ethical. However, as treatments of last resort for debilitating medical conditions, humans have occasionally been fi tted with intracranial electrodes they can selstimulate. Let’s consider two patients studied by Robert Heath at the Tulane University School of Medicine in the 1960s. The fi rst patient had severe narcolepsy; he would abruptly go from being awake into a deep sleep. (Narcolepsy and sleep will be discussed in Chapter 19.) The condition signifi cantly interfered with his life and obviously made it diffi cult to hold a job. He was implanted with 14 electrodes in different areas of the brain in the hope of fi nding a self-stimulation site that might keep him alert. When he stimulated his hippocampus, he reported feeling mild pleasure. Stimulation of his midbrain tegmentum made him feel alert but unpleasant. The site he chose to frequently self-stimulate was the septal area of the forebrain (Figure A). Stimulating this area made him more alert and gave him a good feeling, which he described as building toward orgasm. He reported that he would sometimes push the button over and over, trying unsuccessfully to achieve orgasm, ultimately ending in frustration",

The second patient’s case is a bit more complex. This person had electrodes implanted at 17 brain sites in the hope of learning something about the location of his severe epilepsy. He reported pleasurable feelings with stimulation of the septal area and the midbrain tegmentum. Consistent with the fi rst case above, setal stimulation was associated with sexual feelings. The mibrain stimulation gave him a “happy drunk” feeling. Other mildly positive feelings were produced by stimulation of the amygdala and caudate nucleus. Interestingly, the site he most frequently stimulated was in the medial thalamus, even though stimulation here induced an irritable feeling, one that was less pleasurable than stimulation at other locations. The patient stated that he stimulated this area the most because it gave him the feeling he was about to recall a memory. He repeated the stimulation in a futile attempt to fully bring the memory into his mind, even though, in the end, this process proved to be frustrating. These two specifi c cases and many others suggest that self-stimulation is not synonymous with pleasure. Often some reward or anticipated reward is associated with the stimultion, but the experience is not always pleasant.

    "chunk_text": ". This idea was further supported when researchers discoered that animals will press a lever to receive an injection of ampheamine, a drug that releases dopamine in the brain. Although there is more to electrical self-stimulation than dopamine, there is little question that dopamine release in the brain will reinforce the behavior that causes it. These experiments suggested a mechanism by which natural rewards (food, water, sex) reinforce particular behaviors. Indeed, a hungry rat will press a lever to receive a morsel of food, and this response is also greatly reduced by dopamine receptor blockers. The Role of Dopamine in Motivation For many years, this dopamine projection, from the ventral tegmental area to the forebrain, was believed to serve hedonic reward—in other words, pleasure. In the case of feeding, it was believed that dopamine was released in response to palatable foods, making the sensation plesurable. Animals were motivated to seek palatable food for the hedonic reward: a squirt of dopamine in the forebrain. However, this simple idea has been challenged in recent years. Destruction of the dopamine axons passing through the lateral hypthalamus fails to reduce the hedonic responses to food, even though anmals stop eating. If a tasty morsel is placed on the tongue of a rat that has sustained such a lesion, the animal will still behave as if the food evokes a pleasurable sensation (the rat equivalent of lip smacking), and the morsel will be consumed. The dopamine-depleted animal behaves as though it likes food but does not want food. The animal apparently lacks the motivation to seek food, even though it seems to enjoy it when it is available. Conversely, stimulation of the dopamine axons in the laeral hypothalamus of normal rats appears to produce a craving for food without increasing the food’s hedonic impact. Not surprisingly, recent rsearch on the cravings associated with addiction (to drugs and alcohol, as well as to chocolate) has focused on the role of this dopaminergic pathway (Box 16.5)",

It is no coincidence that some of the most highly addictive drugs (cocaine and amphetamine, for example) act directly on dopamine synapses in the brain. Clues into how dopamine signaling infl uences behavior have come from animal studies in which the activity of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area of the midbrain is monitored with microeletrodes. In one important study, Wolfram Schultz and colleagues at the University of Cambridge, England, explored what happens to dopmine neurons when a sip of juice is given to a monkey shortly after a light was turned on. Initially, before the monkey learned that the light predicts the delivery of juice, Schultz found that the dopamine neurons had no response to light but became briefl y active when the juice was delivered. This is what one might expect if the dopamine nerons were simply registering the occurrence of a pleasurable experence. After the light and the juice were repeatedly paired, however, the dopamine neurons had changed fi ring patterns. They now responded briefl y when the light came on but had no response when the juice was delivered. Furthermore, if Schultz and colleagues tricked the trained monkey and failed to deliver juice after the light, they found that the dopamine neuron fi ring decreased at the time of anticipated reward (Figure 16.17)",

They act on different neurotransmitter systems in the brain—heroin on the opiate system, nicotine on the cholinergic system, and cocaine on the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems—and they produce different psychactive effects. However, all three drugs are highly addictive. This common quality is explained by the fact that they all act on the brain circuitry that motivates behavior—in this case, drug-seeking behavior. We can learn much about the brain mechanisms of motivation by studying drug addiction and vice versa. Rats, like humans, will self-administer drugs and will dvelop clear signs of drug dependence. Studies using micrinfusions of drugs directly into the brain have mapped out the sites where the drugs cause addiction. In the case of heroin and nicotine, the key site of action is the ventral temental area (VTA), home of the dopamine neurons that proect axons through the lateral hypothalamus to the forebrain. These dopaminergic neurons have both opiate and nictinic acetylcholine receptors. In the case of cocaine, a key site of action is the nucleus accumbens, one of the major targets of the ascending dopaminergic axons in the forbrain (Figure A). Recall from Chapter 15 that cocaine prlongs the actions of dopamine at its receptors. Thus, these three drugs either stimulate dopamine release (heroin, nictine) or enhance dopamine actions (cocaine) in the nucleus accumbens. The exact role of dopamine in motivating behavior cotinues to be explored. However, much evidence suggests that animals are motivated to perform behaviors that stimlate dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and rlated structures",

Behaviors associated with the delivery of drugs that act to stimulate dopamine release are therefore strongly reinforced. However, chronic overstimulation of this pathway causes a homeostatic response: The dopmine “reward” system is downregulated. This adaptation leads to the phenomenon of drug tolerance ; it takes more and more of the drug to get the desired (or required) efect. Indeed, drug discontinuation in addicted animals is accompanied by a marked decrease in dopamine release and function in the nucleus accumbens. And, of course, one withdrawal symptom is the powerful craving for the dicontinued drug.

Behaviors that cause expected or better-thaexpected outcomes are repeated; those with outcomes that are worse than expected are not. Just as the monkey learned that the light predicted delivery of juice, you have learned that the smell or sight of pancakes and coffee predict the delivery of breakfast.

We will take a closer look at the mechanisms of memory formation in Chapter 25. Serotonin, Food, and Mood Mood and food are connected. Consider how grouchy you are when you’re on a restricted diet or how good you feel with a whiff and a bite of a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. As mentioned in Chapter 15, one system in the brain involved in the control of mood uses serotonin as a neurotransmitter. Serotonin provides one of the links between food and mood. Measurements of serotonin in the hypothalamus reveal that levels are low during the postabsorptive period, rise in anticipation of food, and spike during a meal, especially in response to carbohydrates (Figure 16.18). Serotonin is derived from the dietary amino acid trytophan, and tryptophan levels in the blood vary with the amount of carbohydrate in the diet (see Box 15.2 in Chapter 15)",

The rise in blood tryptophan and brain serotonin is one likely explanation for the mooelevating effects of a chocolate chip cookie. This effect of “carbs” on mood is particularly evident during periods of stress, possibly explaining the food-seeking behavior and subsequent weight gain of many fi rst-year college students. It is interesting to note that drugs that elevate serotonin levels in the brain are powerful appetite suppressants. One of these drugs is dexfefl uramine (trade name Redux), which was used successfully as a treament for human obesity. Unfortunately, the drug had toxic side effects, leading to its withdrawal from the market in 1997. Abnormalities in brain serotonin regulation are believed to be one factor that contributes to eating disorders. The defi ning charateristic of anorexia nervosa is the voluntary maintenance of body weight at an abnormally low level, while bulimia nervosa is chaacterized by frequent eating binges, often compensated for by forced vomiting. These disorders are also commonly accompanied by depresion , a severe disturbance of mood that has been linked to lowered brain serotonin levels (we will discuss mood disorders in Chapter 22). The serotonin connection is clearest in the case of bulimia. In addtion to depressing mood, low serotonin levels reduce satiety. Indeed, antidepressant drugs that act to elevate brain serotonin levels (e.g., fl uoxetine, or Prozac) are also an effective treatment for most bulimia nervosa patients.

Anne studied motor pattern generators, the simple circuits in the spinal cord that allow coordinated muscle movements to take place. Anne and I researched what happens to the hatching pattern generator in chicks after the bird hatches and has no apparent further use for it. When a chick is ready to hatch from the egg, it is tightly curled with its head under the wing pointing up toward the shell. Every 20 seconds or so, it executes two strong leg movements that propel the body slightly within the egg. The beak gradually makes a circular hole, and when this is large enough, the strong leg movements allow the chick to hatch out. To test the fate of the hatching pattern generator, my job was to place recoring electrodes in the leg muscles and then carefully fold an already-hatched chick back into the hatching position, this time in a glass egg. Remarkably, the chick became quiet and soon began making leg movements indistinguishable from normal hatching movements",

While I had a ball putting weeks-old chickens back in glass eggs, I was simultaneously hatching my own scientifi c approach. I dveloped a great appreciation for Anne’s strategy of asking simple questions that could generate thorough answers, and breaking a complex problem into smaller parts that could be understood clearly. This approach has remained a driving principle in my scientifi c life ever since. How does the nervous system store information? This question has been the focus of my work since graduate school, where I fi rst investigated the cellular basis of persitent changes in the nervous system of Aplysia , a giant sea slug [will be discussed in Chapter 25]. My fascination with long-lasting changes in neuronal excitability led me to posdoctoral work on long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission, a recently discovered phenomenon—and I was hooked forever! Excitatory synapses, when stimulated only for a second or two, increase their strength persistently, for many hours. The opportunity to study how individual synapses are persistently modifi ed was just what I was looking for. To store information, the brain needs to change in rsponse to environmental stimuli, so it makes sense that many circuits would have the capability of synaptic modifi cation. When I began my own lab in 1991, this idea became more and more interesting to me, and led directly to our onging work at Brown University on circuits that underlie mtivation. My best friend from graduate school, Marina Wolf, had been studying addiction-related brain alterations and suggested that drugs of abuse might alter synaptic plasticity in the motivational circuit that includes the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens",

The other is an increase in the concentration of dissolved substances (solutes) in the blood, or hypertonicity . These two stimuli triger thirst by different mechanisms. Thirst triggered by hypovolemia is called volumetric thirst .

Rodents will press a lever to receive cocaine, for example, and will do work or even suffer painful shocks in order to press the lever for the drug, much as substance abusers will suffer tremendous personal loss to acquire the drug. A critical idea in the fi eld has been that drugs of abuse hijack the midbrain dopamine neurons, part of the motivational control system, and by doing so produce an overwhelming craving for the drug, analogous perhaps to the craving for water if one is deprived for a long period. Intriguingly, we found that inhibitory, GABAergic synapses on dopamine cells lost their normal ability to exhibit LTP after a single drug exposure. It had been known for some time that all drugs of abuse increase dopamine release from VTA neurons, and the loss of LTP at inhibitory synapses (and net loss of inhibition) on dopamine neurons is likely a contributing factor. We next made two key fi ndings. First, multiple diffeent drugs of abuse all erased the GABAergic synapse LTP",

Secondly, a brief stressor (5-minute exposure to cold water) had exactly the same effect. What could this mean, when the rewarding effects of drugs seem so different from the avesive effects of stress? Previous work had shown that in rats that had “recovered” from cocaine self-administration (they had learned that the lever press no longer caused drug deliery), either a small dose of the drug or a stressful experience restores powerful drug-seeking behavior, a process known as reinstatement. Human patients also report that minimal drug exposure or stress can trigger relapse and drug craing. It has been suggested that by activating the motivational circuitry, either drugs or stress promote drug seeking. How could our reductionist approach of studying the dtails of synaptic function tell us anything about a complex diorder like drug addiction? We did many experiments to tease out which molecules and pathways are needed for stress to block LTP at the inhibitory VTA synapses. We found one molecule that was clearly required: the kappa opioid recetor. If we used an inhibitor to block kappa receptors prior to stress, we found that LTP was unaffected by the stresful experience. Thus, we had found a pharmacological tool that prevents this brain alteration triggered by acute stress. Might the kappa receptor blocker affect relapse behavior as well? Our colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania, Chris Pierce and Lisa Briand, taught rats to self-administer cocaine in response to a lever press; then they no longer provided cocaine when the lever was pressed. Over several days, the rats pressed the lever less and less, and as expected, a brief stressful experience at this point restored robust lever presing, even when no cocaine was forthcoming",

Kappa receptor inhibitors may therefore have clinical utility in treating stress-induced drug relapse. Despite the brain’s complexity, the approach of uderstanding component parts and processes proved to be powerful in unpredictable and surprising ways. Working with this team of outstanding scientists for many years has been tremendous fun. Together we have shared ups and downs and dry periods as well as periods of exciting discovery.

Vasopressin (also called antidiuretic hormone , or ADH) acts directly on the kidneys to increase water retention and inhibit urine production. The release of vasopressin associated with volumetric thirst is triggered by two types of stimuli (Figure 16.19). First, a rise in blood levels of angiotensin II occurs in response to reduced blood fl ow to the kidneys (see Figure 15.5 in Chapter 15). The circulating angitensin II acts on the neurons of the subfornical organ in the telencephalon, which in turn directly stimulate the magnocellular neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus to release vasopressin",

These signals make their way to the hypothalamus via the vagus nerve and the nucleus of the solitary tract. In addition to this humoral response, reduced blood volume (1) stimlates the sympathetic division of the ANS, which helps correct the drop 574 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR in blood pressure by constricting arterioles, and (2) powerfully motvates animals to seek and consume water. Not surprisingly, the lateral hypothalamus has been implicated in inciting the behavioral response, although the details of this process are still poorly understood. The other stimulus for thirst, hypertonicity of the blood, is sensed by neurons in yet another specialized region of the telencephalon lacking a blood–brain barrier, the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) . When the blood becomes hypertonic, water leaves cells by the process of osmosis. This loss of water is transduced by the OVLT neurons into a change in action potential fi ring frequency. The OVLT neurons (1) directly excite the magnocellular neurosecretory cells that secrete vaspressin, and (2) stimulate osmometric thirst , the motivation to drink water when dehydrated (Figure 16.20). Lesions of the OVLT completely prevent the behavioral and humoral responses to dehydration (but not the responses to loss of blood volume). The motivation to drink and the secretion of vasopressin from the hypthalamus (and the retention of water by the kidneys) normally go hand in hand. However, selective loss of the vasopressin-secreting neurons of the hypothalamus produces a curious condition called diabetes insipidus , in which the body works against the brain. As a consequence of the loss of vasopressin, the kidneys pass too much water from the blood to the urine",

The resulting dehydration stimulates the strong motivation to drink water; however, the water absorbed from the intestines passes quickly through the kidneys into the urine. Thus, diabetes insipidus is characterized by extreme thirst coupled with frequent excretion of a large amount of pale, watery urine. This condition can be treated by replacing the missing vasopressin.

Hypovolemia is detected in two ways. First, angiotensin II, released into the bloodstream in response to decreased blood flow to the kidneys, activates neurons in the subfornical organ. Second, mechanosensory axons in the vagus nerve, detecting a drop in blood pressure, activate neurons in the nucleus of the soltary tract. The subfornical organ and nucleus of the solitary tract relay this information to the hypothalamus, which orchestrates the coordinated response to reduced blood volume. 575 CHAPTER 16 MOTIVATION Temperature Regulation You are hot; you seek a cool place. You are cold; you seek warmth. We are all motivated to interact with our environment to keep our bodies within a narow range of temperatures. The need for such regulation is clear: The cells of the body are fi ne-tuned for a constant temperature, 37°C (98.6°F), and deviations from this temperature interfere with cellular functions. Neurons that change their fi ring rate in response to small changes in temperature are found throughout the brain and spinal cord. However, the most important neurons for temperature homeostasis are found clustered in the anterior hypothalamus. These cells transduce small changes in blood temperature into changes in their fi ring rate",

Humoral and visceromotor rsponses are subsequently initiated by neurons in the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus; somatic motor (behavioral) responses are initiated by the neurons of the lateral hypothalamic area. Lesions in these different regions can selectively abolish different components of the integrated response. A fall in temperature is detected by cold-sensitive neurons of the anterior hypothalamus. In response, TSH is released by the anterior pituitary. TSH stimulates the release of the hormone thyroxin from the thyroid gland, which causes a widespread increase in cellular metabolism. The visceromotor rsponse is constricted blood vessels in the skin and piloerection (goose bumps). An involuntary somatic motor response is shivering (to generate heat in the muscles), and, of course, the other somatic response is to seek warmth. A rise in temperature is detected by warm-sensitive neurons of the aterior hypothalamus. In response, metabolism is slowed by reducing TSH release, blood is shunted toward the body periphery to dissipate heat, and behavior is initiated to seek shade. In some mammals, an involuntary motor response is panting—in humans, it is sweating—which helps cool the body. The strong parallels between the hypothalamic control of energy baance, water balance, and temperature should now be clear. In each case, specialized neurons detect variations in the regulated parameter.

Table 16.1 summarizes some of the hypothalamic responses we have discussed in this chapter. CONCLUDING REMARKS In the motor system chapters of Part II, we addressed “how” questions rlated to behavior. How do muscles contract? How is movement initiated? How are the actions of our different muscles coordinated? The discussion of motivation, however, asks a different question: Why? Why do we eat when our energy reserves become depleted? Why do we drink when we are dehydrated? Why do we seek warmth when our blood temperature falls? Neuroscientists have found concrete answers to both the “how” and the “why” of behavior in the body’s periphery. We move because of the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. We drink because we are thirsty, and we are thirsty when angiotensin II levels rise in response to decreased blood fl ow to the kidneys. However, we remain largely ignrant about the convergence of “how” and “why” in the brain. In this chater, we chose to focus on feeding behavior, in part because the trail leads farthest into the brain. The discovery of orexigenic peptide neurons in the lateral hypothalamus that respond to changes in leptin levels was a major breakthrough. We are now able to frame the question of how these neurons act elsewhere in the brain to initiate feeding behavior. Advances in this research will have a signifi cant impact on how we interpret our own behavior and the behavior of those around us",

After reading about the bloodborne signals that motivate eating and drinking, you might begin to feel that, indeed, we are ruled by our homones. However, while bloodborne signals do have a strong effect on the probability of specifi c types of behavior, we are not their slaves. Clearly, one of the great triumphs of human evolution is the ability to exert conitive, cortical control over our more primitive instincts. This is not to say that we humans make decisions solely on rational thought, however (Box 16.7). In addition to the powerful forces of self-preservation and hredity, our behaviors are molded by many factors that include our pesonal fears, ambitions, incentives, and history. In the coming chapters, we will explore additional infl uences on behavior, including how past eperiences leave their mark on the brain.

Economics was called “the dismal science” in the nineteenth century, initially because of dire predictions by economists that humanity was doomed to unending poverty because the food supply could not keep up with population growth. However, that phrase might also apply to how diffi cult it has been to understand and predict how humans make choices, economic and oterwise (Figure A). What if we could get under the hood and fi nd out what goes on in the brain during a decision? Advances in the technology of neuroscience, particularly the ability to mesure and infl uence brain activity in awake behaving animals, including humans, make this an attainable goal. In the past decade, economists have increasingly looked to studies of the brain to test the validity of their theoretical assumptions, and neurophysiologists and psychologists have embraced economic theories to interpret their data on the neural basis of choice. The mutual attraction of these disciplines spawned a new fi eld, called neuroeconomics . The central goal of neuroeconomics is to combine the tools and insights from economics, neuroscience, and psychology to detemine how individuals make economic decisions. The history of science shows that great advances often occur when trditional disciplines come together to solve a common prolem. There is perhaps no more urgent scientifi c challenge than understanding human behavior. More than any other factor, our individual and collective behaviors will determine the destiny of our species and our planet. Although success in this endeavor is by no means assured, it is certain that the understanding of behavior will require the understanding of neuroscience. Further Reading Glimcher PW, Fehr E. 2014.

The resting potential of a typical neuron is about 65 millivolts (1 mV 0.001 volts). Stated another way, for a neuron at rest, V m 65 mV. This negative resting membrane potential of the neuron is an absolute requirement for a functioning nervous system. To understand the negative membrane potential, we look to the ions that are present and how they are distributed inside and outside the neuron. Equilibrium Potentials Consider a hypothetical cell in which the inside is separated from the ouside by a pure phospholipid membrane with no proteins. Inside this cell, a concentrated potassium salt solution is dissolved, yielding K and A anions (any molecules with a negative charge). Outside the cell is a soltion with the same salt but diluted twentyfold with water. Although a large concentration gradient exists between the inside of the cell and the outside, there is no net movement of ions because the phospholipid blayer, having no channel proteins, is impermeable to charged, hydrophilic atoms. Under these conditions, a microelectrode would record no potential difference between the inside and the outside of the cell. In other words, V m would be equal to 0 mV because the ratio of K to A on each side of the membrane equals 1; both solutions are electrically neutral (Figure 3.12a). Consider how this situation would change if potassium channels were inserted into the phospholipid bilayer. Because of the selective permability of these channels, K would be free to pass across the membrane, but A would not. Initially, diffusion rules: K ions pass through the channels out of the cell, down the steep concentration gradient. Because A is left behind, however, the inside of the cell membrane immediately begins to acquire a net negative charge, and an electrical potential diference is established across the membrane (Figure 3.12b)",

The relative concentrations of potasium (K ) and an impermeable anion (A ) are represented by the sizes of the leters. (b) Inserting a channel that is selectively permeable to K into the membrane initially results in a net movement of K down their concentration gradient, from left to right. (c) A net accumulation of positive charge on the outside and negative charge on the inside retards the movement of positively charged K from the inside to the outside. Equilibrium is established such that there is no net movement of ions across the membrane, leaving a charge difference between the two sides. 68 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS acquires more and more net negative charge, the electrical force starts to pull positively charged K ions back through the channels into the cell. When a certain potential difference is reached, the electrical force puling K ions inside exactly counterbalances the force of diffusion pushing them out. Thus, an equilibrium state is reached in which the diffusional and electrical forces are equal and opposite, and the net movement of K across the membrane ceases (Figure 3.12c). The electrical potential diference that exactly balances an ionic concentration gradient is called an ionic equilibrium potential , or simply equilibrium potential , and it is represented by the symbol E ion. In this example, the equilibrium potetial will be about 80 mV. The example in Figure 3.12 demonstrates that generating a steady electrical potential difference across a membrane is a relatively simple matter. All that is required is an ionic concentration gradient and seletive ionic permeability",

    "chunk_text": ". All that is required is an ionic concentration gradient and seletive ionic permeability. Before moving on to the situation in real neurons, however, we can use this example to make four important points. 1. Large changes in membrane potential are caused by minuscule changes in ionic concentrations . In Figure 3.12, channels were inserted, and K ions fl owed out of the cell until the membrane potential went from 0 mV to the equilibrium potential of 80 mV. How much does this ionic redistribution affect the K concentration on either side of the membrane? Not very much. For a cell with a 50 m diameter, contaiing 100 mM K , it can be calculated that the concentration change rquired to take the membrane from 0 to 80 mV is about 0.00001 mM. That is, when the channels were inserted and the K fl owed out until equilibrium was reached, the internal K concentration went from 100 to 99.99999 mM—a negligible drop in concentration. 2. The net difference in electrical charge occurs at the inside and outside surfaces of the membrane . Because the phospholipid bilayer is so thin (less than 5 nm thick), it is possible for ions on one side to interact electrostatically with ions on the other side. Thus, the negative charges inside the neuron and the positive charges outside the neuron tend to be mutually attracted to the cell membrane. Consider how, on a warm summer evening, mosquitoes are attracted to the outside face of a widow pane when the inside lights are on. Similarly, the net negative charge inside the cell is not distributed evenly in the cytosol but rather is localized at the inner face of the membrane (Figure 3.13). In this way, the membrane is said to store electrical charge, a property called capacitance . 3. Ions are driven across the membrane at a rate proportional to the diference between the membrane potential and the equilibrium potential",

Notice in our example in Figure 3.12 that when the channels were inserted, there was a net movement of K only as long as the electrcal membrane potential differed from the equilibrium potential. The difference between the real membrane potential and the equilibrium potential (V m E ion ) for a particular ion is called the ionic driving force . We’ll talk more about this in Chapters 4 and 5 when we discuss the movement of ions across the membrane during the action potential and synaptic transmission. 4. If the concentration difference across the membrane is known for an ion, the equilibrium potential can be calculated for that ion . In our example in Figure 3.12, we assumed that K was more concentrated inside the cell.

At a certain potential difference, the electrical force pushing Na ions out would exactly counterbalance the force of diffusion pushing them in. In this example, the membrane potential at equilibrium would be positive on the inside. The examples in Figures 3.12 and 3.14 illustrate that if we know the ionic concentration difference across the membrane, we can fi gure out the equilibrium potential for any ion. Prove it to yourself. Assume that Ca 2 is more concentrated on the outside of the cell and that the membrane is selectively permeable to Ca 2 . See if you can fi gure out whether the inside of the cell would be positive or negative at equilibrium. Try it again, asuming that the membrane is selectively permeable to Cl , and that Cl is more concentrated outside the cell. (Pay attention here; note the charge of the ion.) The preceding examples show that each ion has its own equilibrium ptential—the steady electrical potential that would occur if the membrane were permeable only to that ion. Thus, we can speak of the potassium equilibrium potential, E K ; the sodium equilibrium potential, E Na ; the cacium equilibrium potential, E Ca ; and so on. And knowing the electrical charge of the ion and the concentration difference across the membrane, we can easily deduce whether the inside of the cell would be positive or negative at equilibrium.

Let’s see if we can make some sense of it. Remember that equilibrium is the balance of two ifluences: diffusion, which pushes an ion down its cocentration gradient, and electricity, which causes an ion to be attracted to opposite charges and repelled by like charges. Increasing the thermal energy of each particle increases diffusion and therefore increases the potential difference achieved at equilibrium. Thus, E ion is propotional to T. On the other hand, increasing the electrical charge of each particle decreases the potential difference needed to balance diffusion. Therefore, E ion is inversely proportional to the charge of the ion (z). We need not worry about R and F in the Nernst equation because they are constants.

The chemical energy released by this reaction drives the pump, which exchanges internal Na for external K . The ations of this pump ensure that K is concentrated inside the neuron and that Na is concentrated outside. Notice that the pump pushes these ions across the membrane against their concentration gradients (Figure 3.16). This work requires the expenditure of metabolic energy. Indeed, it has been estimated that the sodium-potassium pump expends as much as 70% of the total amount of ATP utilized by the brain. The calcium pump is also an enzyme that actively transports Ca 2 out of the cytosol across the cell membrane. Additional mechanisms decrease intracellular [Ca 2 ] to a very low level (0.0002 mM); these iclude intracellular calcium-binding proteins and organelles, such as mtochondria and types of endoplasmic reticulum, which sequester cytosolic calcium ions.

These proteins may lack the glamour of a gated ion channel, but without ion pumps, the resting membrane potetial would not exist and the brain would not function. Relative Ion Permeabilities of the Membrane at Rest The pumps establish ionic concentration gradients across the neuronal membrane. With knowledge of these ionic concentrations, we can use the Nernst equation to calculate equilibrium potentials for the different ions (see Figure 3.15). Remember, though, that an equilibrium potential for an ion is the membrane potential that would result if a membrane were selectively permeable to that ion alone. In reality, however, neurons are not permeable to only a single type of ion. How does that affect our understanding? Let’s consider a few scenarios involving K and Na . If the membrane of a neuron were permeable only to K , the membrane potential would equal E K , which, according to Figure 3.15, is 80 mV. On the other hand, if the membrane of a neuron were permeable only to Na , the membrane potential would equal E Na , 62 mV. If the membrane were equally permable to K and Na , however, the resulting membrane potential would be some average of E Na and E K . What if the membrane were 40 times more permeable to K than it is to Na ? The membrane potential again would be between E Na and E K but much closer to E K than to E Na . This approxmates the situation in real neurons. The actual resting membrane potetial of 65 mV approaches, but does not reach, the potassium equilibrium potential of 80 mV. This difference arises because, although the mebrane at rest is highly permeable to K , there is also a steady leak of Na into the cell. The resting membrane potential can be calculated using the Goldman equation , a mathematical formula that takes into consideration the reative permeability of the membrane to different ions",

As we have seen, the selective permeability of potassium channels is a key determinant of the resting membrane potential and therefore of neuronal function. What is the mlecular basis for this ionic selectivity? Selectivity for K ions derives from the arrangement of amino acid residues that line the pore regions of the channels. It was a major breakthrough in 1987 when researchers suceeded in determining the amino acid sequences of a family of potassium channels in the fruit fl y Drosophila melanogaster . While these insects may be annoying in the kitchen, they are extremely valuable in the lab because their genes can be studied and manipulated in ways that are not possible in mammals. Normal fl ies, like humans, can be put to sleep with ether vapors. While conducting research on anesthetized insects, investigators discovered that fl ies of one mutant strain responded to the ether by shaking their legs, wings, and abdomen. This strain of fl y was designated Shaker . Detailed studies soon explained the odd behavior by a defect in a particular type of potassium channel (Figure 3.17a)",

Using molecular biological techniques, it was possible to map the gene that was mutated in Shaker . Knowledge of the DNA sequence of what is now called the Shake r potassium chanel enabled researchers to fi nd the genes for other potassium channels based on sequence similarity. This analysis has revealed the existence of a very large number of different potassium channels, including those responsible for maintaining the resting membrane potential in neurons. Most potassium channels have four subunits that are arranged like the staves of a barrel to form a pore (Figure 3.17b). Despite their diversity, the subunits of different potassium channels have common structural features that bestow selectivity for K . Of particular interest is a region called the pore loop , which contributes to the selectivity fi lter that makes the channel permeable mostly to K (Figure 3.18). In addition to fl ies, the deadly scorpion also made an important contrbution to the discovery of the pore loop as the selectivity fi lter. In 1988, Brandeis University biologist Chris Miller and his student Roderick MacKinnon observed that scorpion toxin blocks potassium channels BOX 3.3 The Goldman Equation I f the membrane of a real neuron were permeable only to K , the resting membrane potential would equal E K , about 80 mV. But it does not; the measured resting membrane potetial of a typical neuron is about 65 mV. This discrepancy is explained because real neurons at rest are not exclusively pemeable to K ; there is also some Na permeability. Stated another way, the relative permeability of the resting neuronal membrane is quite high to K and low to Na .

Because the neuronal membrane at rest is mostly permeable to K , the mebrane potential is close to E K . Another consequence of high K permeability is that the membrane potential is particularly sensitive to changes in the concentration of extracellular potassium. This relationship is shown in Figure 3.19. A tenfold change in the K concentration outside the cell, [K ] o , from 5 to 50 mM, would change the membrane potential from 65 to 17 mV. A change in membrane potential from the normal resting value ( 65 mV) to a less negative value is called a depolarization of the membrane. Therefore, increasing extracellular potassium depolarizes neurons . ▲ FIGURE 3.18 A view of the potassium channel pore.

An undergraduate background in physics and subsequent experience as a high school math teacher delivered me in the 1970s to graduate school, post-doctoral training, and my own lab at Brandeis with no formal preparation in (and precious little knowledge of) neurobiology or electrophysioogy. Picking up bits and pieces of these subjects from reaing the literature and osmosing them from my surroundings, I became increasingly fascinated by how ion channels, at that time only just nailed down as proteins, could do their job of producing bioelectricity; in parallel, I grew increasingly horrifi ed by what struck me as the overwhelming complexity of living cells and the ambiguity in molecular interpretation that would inevitably accompany experiments done exclusively on celular membranes. This combination of fascination and horror provoked my attraction to simplifi ed “artifi cial membranes” of defi ned composition, developed by Paul Mueller in the 1960s, with which to follow the electrical activities of ion channels isolated from their complex cellular homes. I worked out a method for inserting single channel molecules from excitable cells into these chemically controllable membranes and used it to record single K channels at a time when card-carrying neurobiologists were beginning to observe single channels in native excitable membranes with the then-new cellular patcrecording methods.

P A T H O F D I S C O V E R Y BOX 3.4 Feeling Around Inside Ion Channels in the Dark The sensitivity of the membrane potential to [K ] o has led to the evolution of mechanisms that tightly regulate extracellular potassium concentrations in the brain. One of these is the blood-brain barrier , a specialization of the walls of brain capillaries that limits the movement of potassium (and other bloodborne substances) into the extracellular fl uid of the brain. Glia, particularly astrocytes, also possess effi cient mechanisms to take up extracellular K whenever concentrations rise, as they normally do during periods of neural activity. Remember, astrocytes fi ll most of the space between neurons in the brain. Astrocytes have membrane potassium pumps that concentrate K in their cytosol, and they also have potassium channels. When [K ] o increases, K enters the astrcyte through the potassium channels, causing the astrocyte membrane to depolarize. The entry of K increases the internal potassium concetration, [K ] i , which is believed to be dissipated over a large area by the extensive network of astrocytic processes. This mechanism for the regulation of [K ] o by astrocytes is called potassium spatial buffering (Figure 3.20). 77 CHAPTER 3 THE NEURONAL MEMBRANE AT REST Eventually, this play led me to compelling problems that could be advantageously attacked with this reductionist aproach",

By the mid-1980s, my lab was home to a collection of supremely talented post-docs—Gary Yellen, Rod MacKinnon, and Jacques Neyton among them—going after the remarkable ion selectivity of various K channels: How do they tell the diference between ions as similar as K and Na , as they must do if neurons are to fi re action potentials, and if we are to think, feel, and act? Having stumbled, while purposelessly fooling around with natural neurotoxins, on a scorpion venom peptide that blocks K channels, we used the power of single-channel analysis to show that this toxin works by plugging up the prtein’s K -selective pore, just like a cork in a bottle (Figure A). In 1988, Rod took our toxin peptide to a Cold Spring Harbor labratory course he’d signed up for to learn how to express ion channels by recombinant DNA methods. There he made a key discovery: that the toxin also blocks Shaker , the fi rst genetically manipulable K channel, cloned the previous year in the lab of Lily and Yuh-Nung Jan. This chance fi nding led us, by making specifi c mutations, to a localized region in the channel’s amino acid sequence that forms the outer entryway of the K seletive pore, a result immediately applicable to the entire family of voltage-dependent K , Na , and Ca 2 channels. A few years later, Rod and Gary, as newly hatched independent investigtors, collaboratively homed in on these pore sequences to fi nd the ion-selectivity hot spots, a result that propelled Rod, 7 years later, to bag the fi rst X-ray crystal structure of a K channel and to begin a whole new “structural era” in ion channel studies. Looking back at my wrestling matches with ion channels, it is clear that the greatest joy I’ve derived from this endeavor has arisen from seeing—and being surprised by—new and unexpected elements of beauty and coherence in the natural world",

    "chunk_text": ". Mrs. Adkins had been a member of the Hemlock Society, which advocates euthanasia as an alternative to death by terminal illness. Dr. Kevorkian agreed to help Mrs. Adkins take her own life. In the back of a 1968 Volkswagen van at a camsite in Oakland County, Michigan, she was hooked to an intravenous line that infused a harmless saline solution. To choose death, Mrs. Adkins switched the solution to one that contained an anesthetic solution, followed automatically by potassium chloride. The anesthetic caused Mrs. Adkins to become unconscious by suppressing the activity of neurons in part of the brain called the reticular formation . Cardiac arest and death were then caused by the KCl injection. The ionic basis of the resting membrane potential explains why the heart stopped beating. Recall that the proper functioning of excitable cells (including those of cardiac muscle) requires that their membranes be maitained at the appropriate resting potential whenever they are not generating impulses. The negative resting potential is a result of selective ionic permeability to K and to the metabolic pumps that concentrate potassium inside the cell. However, as Figure 3.19 shows, membrane potential is very sensitive to changes in the extracellular concentration of potassium. A tenfold rise in extrcellular K would severely diminish the resting potential. Although neurons in the brain are somewhat protected from large changes in [K ] o , other excitable cells in the body, such as muscle cells, are not. Without negative resting potentials, cardiac muscle cells can no longer generate the impulses that lead to contraction, and the heart immediately stops beating. Intravenous potassium chloride is, therefore, a lethal injection.

The activity of the sodium-potassium pump produces and maintains a large K concetration gradient across the membrane. The neuronal membrane at rest is highly permeable to K , owing to the presence of membrane potasium channels. The movement of K ions across the membrane, down their concentration gradient, leaves the inside of the neuronal membrane negatively charged. The electrical potential difference across the membrane can be thought of as a battery whose charge is maintained by the work of the ion pumps. In the next chapter, we see how this battery runs our brain. C O N CL U D ING R E M A R KS 79 CHAPTER 3 THE NEURONAL MEMBRANE AT REST R E V I E W Q U E S T I O N S 1.

    "chunk_text": ". As we saw in Chapter 3, the inside of the neuronal membrane at rest is negatively charged in relation to the outside. The action potential is a rapid reversal of this situation such that, for an instant, the inside of the membrane becomes positively charged in relation to the outside. The action potential is also often called a spike , a nerve impulse , or a discharge . The action potentials generated by a patch of membrane are all simlar in size and duration, and they do not diminish as they are conducted down the axon. Keep in mind the big picture: The frequency and pattern of action potentials constitute the code used by neurons to transfer informtion from one location to another. In this chapter, we discuss the mechnisms that are responsible for the action potential and how it propagates down the axonal membrane. PROPERTIES OF THE ACTION POTENTIAL Action potentials have certain universal properties, features that are shared by axons in the nervous systems of every animal, from a squid to a college student. Let’s begin by exploring some of these properties. What does the action potential look like? How is it initiated? How rapidly can a neuron generate action potentials? The Ups and Downs of an Action Potential In Chapter 3, we saw that the membrane potential, V m , can be determined by inserting a microelectrode in the cell. A voltmeter is used to measure the electrical potential difference between the tip of this intracellular microelectrode and another placed outside the cell. When the neuronal membrane is at rest, the voltmeter reads a steady potential difference of about 65 mV. During the action potential, however, the membrane ptential briefl y becomes positive. Because this occurs so rapidly—100 times faster than the blink of an eye—a special type of voltmeter, called an oscilloscope , is used to study action potentials. The oscilloscope records the voltage as it changes over time (Box 4.1). An action potential, as it would appear on the display of an oscillscope, is shown in Figure 4.1",

This graph represents a plot of membrane potential versus time. Notice that the action potential has certain identfi able parts. The fi rst part, called the rising phase , is characterized by a rapid depolarization of the membrane. This change in membrane potetial continues until V m reaches a peak value of about 40 mV. The part of the action potential where the inside of the neuron is positively charged with respect to the outside is called the overshoot . The falling phase of the action potential is a rapid repolarization until the inside of the mebrane is actually more negative than the resting potential. This last part of the falling phase is called the undershoot , or after-hyperpolariztion . Finally, there is a gradual restoration of the resting potential. From beginning to end, the action potential lasts about 2 milliseconds (msec). The Generation of an Action Potential In Chapter 3, we said that breaking of the skin by a thumbtack was suffi - cient to generate action potentials in a sensory nerve. Let’s continue that example to see how an action potential begins. I NT R O D U C TIO N P R O P E R T I E S OF T HE A C TI ON P O TENTI AL 83 CHAPTER 4 THE ACTION POTENTIAL The perception of sharp pain when a thumbtack enters your foot is caused by the generation of action potentials in certain nerve fi bers in the skin. (We’ll learn more about pain in Chapter 12.) The membrane of these fi bers has a type of gated sodium channel that opens when the nerve ening is stretched. The chain of events therefore begins this way: (1) The thumbtack enters the skin, (2) the membrane of the nerve fi bers in the skin is stretched, (3) and Na -permeable channels open. Because of the large concentration gradient and the negative charge of the inside of the membrane, Na crosses the membrane through these channels",

The entry of Na depolarizes the membrane; that is, the cytoplasmic (inside) suface of the membrane becomes less negative. If this depolarization, called BOX 4.1 Methods of Recording Action Potentials M ethods for studying nerve impulses may be broadly dvided into two types: intracellular and extracellular (Figure A). Intracellular recording requires impaling the neuron or axon with a microelectrode. The small size of most neurons makes this method challenging, which is why so many early studies of action potentials were performed on the neurons of invetebrates, which can be 50–100 times larger than mammalian neurons. Fortunately, recent technical advances have made even the smallest vertebrate neurons accessible to intracelular recording methods, and these studies have confi rmed that much of what was learned in invertebrates is directly applicable to humans. The goal of intracellular recording is simple: to measure the potential difference between the tip of the intracellular electrode and another electrode placed in the solution bating the neuron (electrically continuous with the earth, and thus called ground). The intracellular electrode is fi lled with a concentrated salt solution (often KCl) having a high electrcal conductivity. The electrode is connected to an amplifi er that compares the potential difference between this eletrode and ground. This potential difference can be displayed using an oscilloscope. Early oscilloscopes worked by sweeing a beam of electrons from left to right across a phosphor screen. Vertical defl ections of this beam show changes in voltage. Oscilloscopes today take a digital record of voltage across time, but the principle is the same. It is really just a sophisticated voltmeter that can record rapid changes in volage (such as an action potential)",

As we shall see, the action potential is characterized by a sequence of ionic movements across the neuronal membrane. These electrical currents can be detected, without impaling the neuron, by placing an electrode near the membrane. This is the principle behind extracellular recording . Again, we mesure the potential difference between the tip of the recoring electrode and ground. The electrode can be a fi ne glass capillary fi lled with a salt solution, but it is often simply a thin insulated metal wire. Normally, in the absence of neural actiity, the potential difference between the extracellular recoring electrode and ground is zero. However, when the action potential arrives at the recording position, positive charges fl ow away from the recoring electrode into the neuron. Then, as the action potential passes by, positive charges fl ow out across the membrane toward the recording electrode. Thus, the extracellular action potential is characterized by a brief, alternating voltage difference between the recording electrode and ground. (Notice the different scale of the voltage changes prduced by the action potential recorded with intracellular and extracellular recordings.) These changes in voltage can be seen using an oscilloscope, but they can also be heard by connecting the output of the amplifi er to a loudspeaker. Each impulse makes a ditinctive “pop” sound. Indeed, recording the activity of an active sensory nerve sounds just like popping popcorn.

    "chunk_text": ". The critical level of depolarization that must be reached in order to trigger an action potential is called threshold . Action potentials are caused by depolarization of the membrane beyond threshold. The depolarization that causes action potentials arises in different ways in different neurons. In our previous example, depolarization was caused by the entry of Na through specialized ion channels that were sensitive to membrane stretching. In interneurons, depolarization is usually caused by Na entry through channels that are sensitive to neurotransmitters released by other neurons. In addition to these natural routes, neurons can be deplarized by injecting electrical current through a microelectrode, a method commonly used by neuroscientists to study action potentials in different cells. Generating an action potential by depolarizing a neuron is something like taking a photograph by pressing the shutter button on an old-fashioned camera. Applying pressure on the button has no effect until it increases to the point of crossing a threshold, and then “click”—the shutter opens and one frame of fi lm is exposed. Increasing depolarization of a neuron simlarly has no effect until it crosses threshold, and then “pop”—one action potential. For this reason, action potentials are said to be “all-or-none.” The Generation of Multiple Action Potentials Earlier we likened the generation of an action potential by depolarization to taking a photograph by pressing the shutter button on a camera. But what if the camera is one of those fancy ones used by fashion and sports photoraphers where continued pressure on the button causes the camera to shoot frame after frame? The same thing is true for a neuron. If, for example, we pass continuous depolarizing current into a neuron through a microelectrode, we generate not one but many action potentials in succession (Figure 4.2). The rate of action potential generation depends on the magnitude of the continuous depolarizing current",

Thus, the fi ring frequency of action potentials refl ects the magnitude of the depolarizing current. This is one way that stimulation intensity is encoded in the nervous system (Figure 4.3). Although fi ring frequency increases with the amount of depolarizing current, there is a limit to the rate at which a neuron can generate action potentials. The maximum fi ring frequency is about 1000 Hz; once an action potential is initiated, it is impossible to initiate another for about 1 msec.

Ernst Bamberg, the director of my deparment, convinced me to undertake a novel approach in studing microbial rhodopsins—proteins that transport ions across membranes when they absorb light energy. We expressed the gene for bacteriorhodopsin in frog eggs (oocytes), and measured its light-activated electrical current with microeletrodes. In 1995, we demonstrated that illumination of bacterorhodopsin triggered proton (H ) pumping across the oocyte membrane. We then went on in 1996 to study the light-actvated chloride pump halorhodopsin with this new technique. We also received DNA for chlamyopsin-1 and -2, proposed to be photoreceptor proteins in the green alga Chlamydomonas rinhardtii , from Peter Hegemann at the University of Regensburg. Unfortunately, like all the other labs who received this DNA, we were unable to observe any light-induced electrical signals. Nevertheless, I agreed to test the function of a new presumed rhodopsin from Chlamydomonas when Peter called me, anouncing that they had found a “real light-gated calcium chanel,” which he wanted to name chlamyrhodopsin-3",

Although this new protein had not been purifi ed, “chlamyopsin-3” was dtected in a data bank of DNA sequences from Chlamydomonas , produced at the research center in Kazusa, Japan, and showed similarities to bacteriorhodopsin. This made it an interesting cadidate for the long-sought rhodopsin in Chlamydomonas . Peter requested the DNA from Japan, and I then expressed it in ocytes. Our initial experiments, however, were disappointing bcause removal or addition of calcium to the oocyte bath solution made no difference to the light-activated electrical current, as would be expected if it actually were a Ca 2 permeable channel. The photocurrent itself was rather weak and did not seem to be infl uenced by any change in the ionic concentrations in the bath solution. As I still liked the idea of a directly light-gated ion channel, which most other researchers in the fi eld rejected, I continued to test different bath solutions. One evening, I got a stunningly large inward light-activated current with a solution designed to inhibit calcium currents. It turned out, however, that the soltion I used was badly buffered; in fact, it was quite acidic with too much H ! But this was a breakthrough as I now had good evidence for an inward-directed light-dependent H condutance. Then, by acidifying the oocyte (that is, increasing the H concentration of the oocyte interior relative to the ouside), I found I was able to reliably generate outward-directed light-activated currents as well. It soon became clear that we have with chlamyrhodopsin–3 a light-gated proton channel ; therefore, I proposed to my colleagues Peter Hegemann and Ernst Bamberg to call this new protein channelrhodopsin-1. Further experiments revealed that other monovalent cations can also permeate channelrhodopsin-1. The small photocurents we observed initially are now understood to be due to poor expression of channelrhodopsin-1 in oocytes",

Optogenetics: Controlling Neural Activity with Light. As we have dicussed, action potentials are caused by the depolarization of the membrane beyond a threshold value, as occurs naturally in neurons by the opening of ion channels that allow Na to cross the membrane. To artifi cially control neuronal fi ring rates, neuroscientists historically have had to use microelectrodes to inject electrical current. This limitation was recently overcome with a revolutionary new approach called optogenetics , which introduces into neurons foreign genes that express membrane ion chanels that open in response to light. 87 CHAPTER 4 THE ACTION POTENTIAL acids long in its native form, could be shortened to 310 amino acids and attached to yellow fl uorescent protein (YFP) to allow visualization of protein expression.

One of our fi rst “victims” was Alexander Gottschalk at the nearby University of Frankfurt, as he worked with the small translucent nematode worm Caenorhabditis eegans (C. elegans) . Unfortunately, I made an error in preparing the DNA such that that the worms, although nicely labeled by YFP, did not react to light. Once I realized my mistake and got chop2–YFP into C. elegans muscle cells, we were amazed how easily these little worms could be induced to contract simply by illumination with blue light. At about the same time (April 2004) Karl Deisseroth at Stanford University asked for the DNA and advice on its use in a collaboration, which I happily accepted. Karl quickly demonstrated the power of channerhodopsin-2 in mammalian neurons. His exciting work with Ed Boyden and Feng Zhang attracted a lot of attention, prompting many requests for the DNA to express this protein in the brain. Many coleagues from Europe only then realized that chanelrhodopsins were fi rst characterized in Frankfurt. The success and ease of application of channelrhodopsin-2 led Karl and Alexander to woder if there are other rhodopsins that might be used for light-induced inhibition of neuronal activity. We told them about bacteriorhodopsin and halorhdopsin, the light-activated proton export and chlride import pumps, respectively. Both pumps render the cell interior more negative (i.e., they are light-ativated hyperpolarizers). We recommended halorhdopsin from the microbe Natronomonas pharaonis as a light-activated hyperpolarizer. We took advatage of what we had learned back in 1996: that halorhodopsin had a high affi nity for chloride and that its expression was stable in animal cells.

By introducing the ChR2 gene into mammalian cells, they showed that it encodes a lighsensitive cation channel that is permeable to Na and Ca 2 (Box 4.2).

The enormous potential of optogeneics was subsequently demonstrated by researchers in the United States who showed that the behavior of rats and mice could be dramatically infl uenced by shining blue light onto neurons in which the ChR2 gene 88 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS was introduced (Figure 4.4). Newer additions to the “optogenetic toolkit” available to researchers include halorhodopsin, a protein derived from single-cell microbes that will inhibit neurons in response to yellow light. Understanding how behaviors arise, of course, requires understanding how action potentials arise and propagate through the nervous system. We now take a look at how the movement of ions through the neuron’s own specialized protein channels causes a neural signal with these inteesting properties. THE ACTION POTENTIAL, IN THEORY The action potential is a dramatic redistribution of electrical charge across the membrane. Depolarization of the cell during the action potential is caused by the infl ux of sodium ions across the membrane, and repolarization is caused by the effl ux of potassium ions . Let’s apply some of the concepts itroduced in Chapter 3 to help us understand how ions are driven across the membrane, and how these ionic movements affect the membrane potential. Membrane Currents and Conductances Consider the idealized neuron illustrated in Figure 4.5. The membrane of this cell has three types of protein molecules: sodium-potassium pumps, potassium channels, and sodium channels. The pumps work continuously to establish and maintain concentration gradients. As in all our previous examples, we’ll assume that K is concentrated twentyfold inside the cell and that Na is concentrated tenfold outside the cell.

We begin by assuming that both the potassium channels and the sodium channels are closed, and that the membrane potential, V m , is equal to 0 mV (Figure 4.5a). Now let’s open the potassium channels only (Figure 4.5b). As we learned in Chapter 3, K will fl ow out of the cell, down the concentration gradient, until the inside becomes negatively charged, and V m E K (Figure 4.5c). Here we want to focus our attention on the movement of K that took the membrane potential from 0 mV to 80 mV. Consider these three points: 1. The net movement of K across the membrane is an electrical current. We can represent this current using the symbol I K . 2. The number of open potassium channels is proportional to an electrical conductance. We can represent this conductance by the symbol g K . 3. Membrane potassium current, I K , will fl ow only as long as V m E K . The driving force on K is defi ned as the difference between the real mebrane potential and the equilibrium potential, which can be written as V m E K . There is a simple relationship between the ionic driving force, ionic conductance, and the amount of ionic current that will fl ow. For K , this may be written: I K g K (V m E K ). More generally, we write: I ion g ion (V m E ion ). If this sounds familiar, that is because it is simply an expression of Ohm’s law, I gV, which we learned about in Chapter 3.

(c) At equilirium, there is no net potassium current because, although g K 0, the membrane potetial at equilibrium equals E K . At equilibrium, an equal number of K enters and leaves. Now let’s take another look at our example. Initially we began with V m 0 mV and no ionic membrane permeability (see Figure 4.5a). There is a large driving force on K because V m E K ; in fact, (V m E K ) 80 mV. However, because the membrane is impermeable to K , the potassium conductance, g K , equals zero. Consequently, I K 0.

Notice that the current fl ow is in the direction that takes V m toward E K . When V m E K , the membrane is at equilibrium, and no net current will fl ow. In this condition, although there is a large potasium conductance, g K , there is no longer any net driving force on the K (Figure 4.5c). The Ins and Outs of an Action Potential Let’s pick up the action where we left off in the last section. The mebrane of our ideal neuron is permeable only to K , and V m E K 80 mV. What’s happening with the Na concentrated outside the cell? Because the membrane potential is so negative relative to the sodium equilibrium potential, there is a very large driving force on Na ([V m E Na ] [ 80 mV 62 mV] 142 mV). Nonetheless, there can be no net Na current as long as the membrane is impermeable to Na . But now let’s open the sdium channels and see what happens to the membrane potential. At the instant we change the ionic permeability of the membrane, g Na is high, and, as we discussed earlier, there is a large driving force pushing on Na . Thus, we have what it takes to generate a large sodium current, I Na , across the membrane. Na passes through the membrane sodium channels in the direction that takes V m toward E Na ; in this case, the sodium current, I Na , is inward across the membrane. Assuming the membrane permeability is now far greater to sodium than it is to potasium, this infl ux of Na depolarizes the neuron until V m approaches E Na , 62 mV. Notice that something remarkable happened here. Simply by switcing the dominant membrane permeability from K to Na , we were able to rapidly reverse the membrane potential",

In theory, then, the rising phase of the action potential could be explained if, in response to depolaization of the membrane beyond threshold, membrane sodium channels opened. This would allow Na to enter the neuron, causing a massive depolarization until the membrane potential approached E Na . How could we account for the falling phase of the action potential? Simply assume that sodium channels quickly close and the potassium channels remain open, so the dominant membrane ion permeability switches back from Na to K . Then K would fl ow out of the cell until the membrane potential again equals E K . Our model for the ins and outs, ups and downs of the action potential in an idealized neuron is shown in Figure 4.6. The rising phase of the action potential is explained by an inward sodium current, and the falling phase is explained by an outward potassium current. The action potential therefore could be accounted for simply by the movement of ions through channels that are gated by changes in the membrane potential. If you understand this concept, you understand a lot about the ionic basis of the action potential. What’s left now is to see how this actually happens—in a real neuron. THE ACTION POTENTIAL, IN REALITY Let’s quickly review our theory of the action potential. When the mebrane is depolarized to threshold, there is a transient increase in g Na . The increase in g Na allows the entry of Na , which depolarizes the neuron. And the increase in g Na must be brief in duration to account for the short duration of the action potential. Restoring the negative membrane potetial would be further aided by a transient increase in g K during the falling phase, allowing K to leave the depolarized neuron faster",

The voltage clamp enabled Hodgkin and Huxley to “clamp” the membrane potential of an axon at any value they chose. They could then deduce the changes in membrane conductance that occur at different membrane potentials by measuring the currents that fl owed across the membrane. In an elegant series of experiments, Hodgkin and Huxley showed that the rising phase of the action potential was indeed caused by a transient increase in g Na and an infl ux of Na , and that the falling phase was associated with an increase in g K and an effl ux of K . Their accomplishments were recognized with the Nobel Prize in 1963. To account for the transient changes in g Na , Hodgkin and Huxley prposed the existence of sodium “gates” in the axonal membrane. They hypothesized that these gates are “activated” (opened) by depolarization above threshold and “inactivated” (closed and locked) when the membrane acquires a positive membrane potential. These gates are “deinactivated” (unlocked and enabled to be opened again) only after the membrane potential returns to a negative value. It is a tribute to Hodgkin and Huxley that their hypotheses about mebrane gates came more than 20 years before the direct demonstration of voltage-gated channel proteins in the neuronal membrane. We have a new understanding of gated membrane channels, thanks to two more recent scientifi c breakthroughs. First, new molecular biological techniques have enabled neuroscientists to determine the detailed structure of these prteins. Second, new neurophysiological techniques have enabled neuroscentists to measure the ionic currents that pass through single channels.

The protein forms a pore in the membrane that is highly selective to Na , and the pore is opened and closed by changes in membrane voltage. Sodium Channel Structure. The voltage-gated sodium channel is created from a single long polypeptide. The molecule has four distinct domains, numbered I–IV; each domain consists of six transmembrane alpha hlices, numbered S1–S6 (Figure 4.7). The four domains clump together to form a pore between them. The pore is closed at the negative resting membrane potential. When the membrane is depolarized to threshold, however, the molecule twists into a confi guration that allows the passage of Na through the pore (Figure 4.8). Like the potassium channel, the sodium channel has pore loops that are assembled into a selectivity fi lter. This fi lter makes the sodium chanel twelve times more permeable to Na than it is to K . Apparently, the Na ions are stripped of most, but not all, of their associated water molecules as they pass into the channel. The retained water serves as a sort of molecular chaperone for the ion, and is necessary for the ion to pass the selectivity fi lter. The ion–water complex can then be used to select Na and exclude K (Figure 4.9). 93 CHAPTER 4 THE ACTION POTENTIAL + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + (a) (b) (c) S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 Inside cell N C Outside cell I II III IV Pore loop Gate Voltage sensor Selectivity filter ▲ FIGURE 4.7 The structure of the voltage-gated sodium channel.

It has now been established that the voltage sensor resides in segment S4 of the molecule. In this segment, positively charged amino acid residues are regularly spaced along the coils of the helix. Thus, the entire segment can be forced to move by changing the membrane potetial. Depolarization twists S4, and this conformational change in the molecule causes the gate to open. Functional Properties of the Sodium Channel. Research performed around 1980 at the Max Planck Institute in Goettingen, Germany, revealed the funtional properties of the voltage-gated sodium channel. A new method was used, called the patch clamp , to study the ionic currents passing through individual ion channels (Box 4.3). The patch-clamp method entails sealing the tip of an electrode to a very small patch of neuronal membrane. This patch can then be torn away from the neuron, and the ionic currents across it can be measured as the membrane potential is clamped at any value the experimenter selects. With luck, the patch will contain only a single channel, and the behavior of this channel can be studied. Patch clamping enabled ivestigation of the functional properties of the voltage-gated sodium channel. Changing the membrane potential of a patch of axonal membrane from 80 to 65 mV has little effect on the voltage-gated sodium channels. They remain closed because depolarization of the membrane has not yet reached threshold",

Changing the membrane potential from 65 to 40 mV, however, causes these channels to pop open. As shown in Figure 4.10, voltage-gated sodium channels have a characteristic pattern of behavior: 1. They open with little delay. 2. They stay open for about 1 msec and then close (inactivate). 3. They cannot be opened again by depolarization until the membrane potential returns to a negative value near threshold. A hypothetical model for how conformational changes in the voltaggated sodium channel could account for these properties is illustrated in Figure 4.10c. A single channel does not an action potential make. The membrane of an axon may contain thousands of sodium channels per square micrometer ( m 2 ), and the concerted action of all these channels is required to geneate what we measure as an action potential. Nonetheless, it is interesting to see how many of the properties of the action potential can be explained by the properties of the voltage-gated sodium channel. For example, the fact that single channels do not open until a critical level of membrane depolarization is reached explains the action potential threshold. The rapid opening of the channels in response to depolarization explains why the rising phase of the action potential occurs so quickly.

Furthermore, inactivation of the channels can account for the absolute refractory period: Another action potential cannot be generated until the channels are activated. There are several different sodium channel genes in the human genome. Differences in the expression of these genes among neurons can give rise to subtle but important variations in the properties of the action potential. BOX 4.3 The Patch-Clamp Method T he very existence of voltage-gated channels in the neronal membrane was mere conjecture until methods were developed to study individual channel proteins. A revoltionary new method, the patch clamp, was developed by German neuroscientists Bert Sakmann and Erwin Neher in the mid-1970s. In recognition of their contribution, Sakmann and Neher were awarded the 1991 Nobel Prize. Patch clamping enables one to record ionic currents through single channels (Figure A). The fi rst step is gently lowering the fi re-polished tip of a glass recording electrode, 1–5 m in diameter, onto the membrane of the neuron (part a), and then applying suction within the electrode tip (part b). A tight seal forms between the walls of the electrode and the underlying patch of membrane. This “gigaohm” seal (so named because of its high electrical resistance: 10 9 ) leaves the ions in the electrode only one path to take, through the channels in the underlying patch of membrane. If the electrode is then withdrawn from the cell, the membrane patch can be torn away (part c), and ionic currents can be measured as steady voltages are applied across the mebrane (part d). With a little luck, one can resolve currents fl owing through single channels",

The amplitude of the measured current at a constant membrane voltage refl ects the channel conductance, and the duration of the current refl ects the time the channel is open. Patch-clamp recordings reveal that most channels fl ip between two conductance states that can be interpreted as open or closed. The time they remain open can vary, but the single-channel conductance value stays the same and is therefore said to be unitary.

Epileptic seizures result from explosive, highly synchronous electrical activity in the brain. (Epilepsy is discussed in detail in Chapter 19.) The seizures in this disorder occur in response to fever ( febrile is from the Latin word for “fever”). They usually occur only in early childhood, between 3 months and 5 years of age. Although precisely how the seizures are triggered by an increase in brain temperature is not clear, the mutations’ effects include slowing the inactvation of the sodium channel, prolonging the action potential.

Researchers at Duke University discovered in the 1960s that a toxin isolated from the ovaries of the puffer fi sh (Figure 4.11) could selectively block the sodium channel. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) clogs the Na -permeable pore by binding tightly to a specifi c site on the outside of the channel. TTX blocks all sodiudependent action potentials and therefore is usually fatal if ingested. Nonetheless, puffer fi sh are considered a delicacy in Japan.

Although there is some variability from chanel to channel, all of them open with little delay and stay open for less than 1 msec. Notice that after they have opened once, they close and stay closed as long as the membrane is maintained at a depolarized V m . ➂ The closure of the sodium channel by steady depolarization is called inactivation. ➃ To deinactivate the channels, the mebrane must be returned to 65 mV again.

Another channel-blocking toxin is saxitoxin , produced by dinofl agellates of the genus Gonyaulax . Saxitoxin is concentrated in clams, mussels, and other shellfi sh that feed on these marine protozoa. Occasionally the dinofl agellates bloom, causing what is known as a “red tide.” Eating shellfi sh at these times can be fatal because of the unusually high concentration of the toxin. In addition to the toxins that block sodium channels, certain copounds interfere with nervous system function by causing the channels to open inappropriately. In this category is batrachotoxin , isolated from the skin of a species of Colombian frog. Batrachotoxin causes the channels to open at more negative potentials and to stay open much longer than usual, thus scrambling the information encoded by the action potentials. Toxins produced by lilies ( veratridine ) and buttercups ( aconitine ) have a similar mechanism of action. Sodium channel inactivation is also dirupted by toxins from scorpions and sea anemones. What can we learn from these toxins? First, the different toxins disrupt channel function by binding to different sites on the protein. Information about toxin binding and its consequences have helped researchers deduce the three-dimensional structure of the sodium channel. Second, the toxins can be used as experimental tools to study the consequences of blocking action potentials",

Be careful what you put in your mouth! Voltage-Gated Potassium Channels Hodgkin’s and Huxley’s experiments indicated that the falling phase of the action potential was explained only partly by the inactivation of g Na . ▲ FIGURE 4.11 The puffer fish, source of TTX. (Source: Courtesy of Dr. Toshio Narahashi, Duke University.) 98 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS They found there was also a transient increase in g K that functioned to speed the restoration of a negative membrane potential after the spike. They proposed the existence of membrane potassium gates that, like sodium gates, open in response to depolarization of the membrane. Unlike sodium gates, however, potassium gates do not open immediately upon depolarization; it takes about 1 msec for them to open. Because of this delay, and because this potassium conductance serves to rectify, or reset, the membrane potential, they called this conductance the delayed rectifi er . We now know that there are many different types of voltage-gated potassium channels . Most of them open when the membrane is deplarized and function to diminish any further depolarization by giving K a path to leave the cell across the membrane. The known voltage-gated potassium channels have a similar structure. The channel proteins cosist of four separate polypeptide subunits that come together to form a pore between them. Like the sodium channel, these proteins are sensitive to changes in the electrical fi eld across the membrane. When the mebrane is depolarized, the subunits are believed to twist into a shape that allows K to pass through the pore",

Putting the Pieces Together We can now use what we’ve learned about ions and channels to explain the key properties of the action potential (Figure 4.12): • Threshold . Threshold is the membrane potential at which enough voltage-gated sodium channels open so that the relative ionic permability of the membrane favors sodium over potassium. • Rising phase . When the inside of the membrane has a negative eletrical potential, there is a large driving force on Na . Therefore, Na rushes into the cell through the open sodium channels, causing the membrane to rapidly depolarize. • Overshoot . Because the relative permeability of the membrane greatly favors sodium, the membrane potential goes to a value close to E Na , which is greater than 0 mV. • Falling phase . The behavior of two types of channels contributes to the falling phase. First, the voltage-gated sodium channels inactivate. Second, the voltage-gated potassium channels fi nally open (triggered to do so 1 msec earlier by the depolarization of the membrane). There is a great driving force on K when the membrane is strongly depolaized. Therefore, K rushes out of the cell through the open channels, causing the membrane potential to become negative again. • Undershoot . The open voltage-gated potassium channels add to the resting potassium membrane permeability. Because there is very little sodium permeability, the membrane potential goes toward E K , causing a hyperpolarization relative to the resting membrane potential until the voltage-gated potassium channels close again. • Absolute refractory period . Sodium channels inactivate when the mebrane becomes strongly depolarized. They cannot be activated again, and another action potential cannot be generated, until the membrane potential becomes suffi ciently negative to deinactivate the channels. • Relative refractory period",

The pump maintains the ionic concentration gradients that drive Na and K through their channels during the action potential. 100 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS ACTION POTENTIAL CONDUCTION To transfer information from one point to another in the nervous system, it is necessary that the action potential, once generated, be conducted down the axon. This process is like the burning of a fuse. Imagine you’re holding a fi recracker with a burning match held under the end of the fuse. The fuse ignites when it gets hot enough (beyond some threshold). The tip of the burning fuse heats up the segment of fuse immediately ahead of it until it ignites. In this way, the fl ame steadily works its way down the fuse. Note that the fuse lit at one end only burns in one direction; the fl ame cannot turn back on itself because the combustible material just behind it is spent. Propagation of the action potential along the axon is similar to the propagation of the fl ame along the fuse. When a patch of axonal membrane is depolarized suffi ciently to reach threshold, voltage-gated sodium channels pop open, and the action potential is initiated. The infl ux of positive charge spreads inside the axon to depolarize the adjcent segment of membrane, and when it reaches threshold, the sodium channels in this patch of membrane also pop open (Figure 4.13)",

An action potential initiated at one end of an axon propagates only in one direction; it does not turn back on itself. This is because the mebrane just behind it is refractory, due to inactivation of the sodium channels. Normally, action potentials conduct only in one direction, from the soma to the axon terminal; this is called orthodromic conduction. But, just like the fuse, an action potential can be generated by depolarization at either end of the axon and can therefore propagate in either direction. Backward propagation, elicited experimentally, is called antidromic coduction.

The fuse works the same way because it is combustible along its entire length. Unlike the fuse, however, the axon can regenerate its fi ring ability. Action potential conduction velocities vary, but 10 m/sec is a typical rate. Remember, from start to fi nish the action potential lasts about 2 msec. From this, we can calculate the length of membrane that is egaged in the action potential at any instant in time: 10 m/sec 2 10 3 sec 2 10 2 m.

When this patch of membrane reaches threshold, the voltage-gated sodium channels will open, and the action potential will “burn” on down the membrane. The speed with which the action potential propagates down the axon depends on how far the deplarization ahead of the action potential spreads, which in turn depends on certain physical characteristics of the axon. Imagine that the infl ux of positive charge into an axon during the ation potential is like turning on the water to a leaky garden hose. There are two paths the water can take: one, down the inside of the hose; the other, through the perforated wall of the hose. How much water goes along each path depends on their relative resistance; most of the water will take the path of least resistance. If the hose is narrow and the leaks are numerous and large, most of the water will fl ow out through the leaks. If the hose is wide and the leaks are few and tiny, most of the water will fl ow down the inside of the hose. The same principles apply to positive current spreading down the axon ahead of the action potential. There are two paths that positive charge can take: down the inside of the axon, or across the axonal membrane. If the axon is narrow and there are many open membrane pores, most of the current will fl ow out across the membrane. If the axon is wide and there are few open membrane pores, most of the current will fl ow down inside the axon. The farther the current goes down the axon, the farther ahead of the action potential the membrane will be depolarized, and the faster the action potential will propagate. As a rule, therefore, action potential conduction velocity increases with increasing axonal diameter. As a consequence of this relationship between axonal diameter and conduction velocity, neural pathways that are especially important for survival have evolved unusually large axons",

The squid giant axon can be 1 mm in diameter, so large that originally it was thought to be part of the animal’s circulatory system. Neuroscience owes a debt to British zoologist J. Z. Young, who in 1939 called attention to the squid giant axon as an experimental preparation for studying the biophysics of the neurnal membrane. Hodgkin and Huxley used this preparation to elucidate the ionic basis of the action potential, and the giant axon continues to be used today in a wide range of neurobiological studies. It is interesting to note that axonal size and the number of voltage-gated channels in the membrane also affect axonal excitability. Smaller axons require greater depolarization to reach action potential threshold and are more sensitive to being blocked by local anesthetics (Box 4.4). 102 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS O F S P E C I A L I N T E R E S T BOX 4.4 Local Anesthesia A lthough you’ve tried to tough it out, you just can’t take it anymore.

The fi rst local anesthetic introduced into medical practice was cocaine. The chemical was isolated from the leaves of the coca plant in 1860 by the German physician Albert Niemann. According to the custom of the pharmacologists of his day, Niemann tasted the new compound and discovered that it caused his tongue to go numb. It was soon learned that cocaine also had toxic and addictive properties. (The minaltering effect of cocaine was studied by another well-known physician of that era, Sigmund Freud. Cocaine alters mood by a mechanism distinct from its local anesthetic action, as we shall see in Chapter 15.) The search for a suitable synthetic anesthetic as a substtute for cocaine led to the development of lidocaine, which is now the most widely used local anesthetic. Lidocaine can be dissolved into a jelly and smeared onto the mucous membranes of the mouth (and elsewhere) to numb the nerve endings (called topical anesthesia) ; it can be injected directly into a tissue ( infi ltration anesthesia ) or a nerve ( nerve block ); it can even be infused into the cerebrospinal fl uid bathing the spinal cord ( spinal anesthesia ), where it can numb large parts of the body. Lidocaine and other local anesthetics prevent action potentials by binding to the voltage-gated sodium channels. The binding site for lidocaine has been identifi ed as the S6 alpha helix of domain IV of the protein (Figure A). Lidocaine cannot gain access to this site from the outside. The anethetic fi rst must cross the axonal membrane and then pass through the open gate of the channel to fi nd its binding site inside the pore. This explains why active nerves are blocked faster (the sodium channel gates are open more often). The bound lidocaine interferes with the fl ow of Na that normally results from depolarizing the channel",

Smaller axons are affected by local anesthetics before larger axons because their action potentials have less of a safety margin; more of the voltage-gated sodium channels must function to ensure that the action potential doesn’t fi zzle out as it conducts down the axon. This increased sensitivity of small axons to local anesthetics is fortuitous in clinical practice. As we will discover in Chapter 12, it is the smaller fi bers that convey information about painful stimuli—like a toothache.

If all the axons in your brain were the diameter of a squid giant axon, your head would be too big to fi t through a barn door. Fortunately, vertbrates evolved another solution for increasing action potential conduction velocity: wrapping the axon with insulation called myelin (see Chapter 2). The myelin sheath consists of many layers of membrane provided by glial support cells—Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (outside the brain and spinal cord) and oligodendroglia in the central nervous system. Just as wrapping a leaky garden hose with duct tape facilitates water fl ow down the inside of the hose, myelin facilitates current fl ow down the inside of the axon, thereby increasing action potential condution velocity (Box 4.5). The myelin sheath does not extend continuously along the entire length of the axon. There are breaks in the insulation where ions cross the membrane to generate action potentials",

There are breaks in the insulation where ions cross the membrane to generate action potentials. Recall from Chapter 2 that these breaks in the myelin sheath are the nodes of Ranvier (Figure 4.14). Voltage-gated sodium channels are concentrated in the membrane of the nodes. The distance between nodes is usually 0.2 2.0 mm, depending on the size of the axon (fatter axons have larger intenodal distances). Imagine that the action potential traveling along the axon membrane is like you traveling down a sidewalk. Action potential conduction witout myelin is like walking down the sidewalk in small steps, heel-to-toe, using every inch of the sidewalk to creep along.

Victims of MS often complain of weakness, lack of coordintion, and impaired vision and speech. The disease is caprcious, usually marked by remissions and relapses that occur over a period of many years. Although the precise cause of MS is still poorly understood, the cause of the sensory and motor disturbances is now quite clear. MS attacks the myelin sheaths of bundles of axons in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. The word sclerosis is derived from the Greek word for “hardening,” which describes the lesions that dvelop around bundles of axons, and the sclerosis is multiple because the disease attacks many sites in the nervous sytem at the same time. Lesions in the brain can now be viewed noninvasively using new methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, neurologists have been able to diagnose MS for many years by taking advantage of the fact that myelin serves the nervous system by increasing the velocity of axonal conduction",

However, neurologists have been able to diagnose MS for many years by taking advantage of the fact that myelin serves the nervous system by increasing the velocity of axonal conduction. One simple test involves stimulating the eye with a checkerboard pattern and measuring the elapsed time until an electrical response is noted at the scalp over the part of the brain that is a target of the optic nerve. People who have MS characteristically have a marked slowing of the conduction velocity of their optic nerve. Another demyelinating disease called Guillain–Barré sydrome attacks the myelin of the peripheral nerves that innevate muscle and skin. This disease may follow minor infetious illnesses and inoculations, and it appears to result from an anomalous immunological response against one’s own myelin. The symptoms stem directly from the slowing and/ or failure of action potential conduction in the axons that inervate the muscles. This conduction defi cit can be demostrated clinically by stimulating peripheral nerves electrically through the skin and measuring the time it takes to evoke a response (a twitch of a muscle, for instance). Both MS and Guillain–Barré syndrome are characterized by a profound slowing of the response time because saltatory conduction is disrupted. 104 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS in contrast, is like skipping down the sidewalk. In myelinated axons, action potentials skip from node to node (Figure 4.15). This type of action potential propagation is called saltatory conduction (from the Latin meaning “to leap”).

Compare this figure with Figure 4.12. 105 CHAPTER 4 THE ACTION POTENTIAL because they have very few voltage-gated sodium channels. Only membrane that contains these specialized protein molecules is cpable of generating action potentials, and this type of excitable mebrane is usually found only in axons. Therefore, the part of the neron where an axon originates from the soma, the axon hillock, is often also called the spike-initiation zone . In a typical neuron in the brain or spinal cord, the depolarization of the dendrites and soma caused by synaptic input from other neurons leads to the generation of action potentials if the membrane of the axon hillock is depolarized beyond threshold (Figure 4.16a). In most sensory neurons, however, the spike-initiation zone occurs near the sensory nerve endings , where the depolarization caused by sensory stimulation leads to the geeration of action potentials that propagate along the sensory nerves (Figure 4.16b). In Chapter 2, we learned that axons and dendrites differ in their morphology. We now see that they are functionally different, and that this difference in function is specified at the molecular level by the type of protein in the neuronal membrane. Differences in the types and density of membrane ion channels can also account for the characteristic electrical properties of different types of neurons (Box 4.6).

Despite the diversity of neuronal structure, the axonal membrane can be identified at the molecular level by its high density of voltage-gated sodium channels. This molecular distinction enables axons to generate and conduct action potentials. The region of membrane where action potentials are normally generated is called the spike-initiation zone. The arrows indicate the normal direction of action potential propagation in these two types of neuron. 106 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS O F S P E C I A L I N T E R E S T BOX 4.6 The Eclectic Electric Behavior of Neurons N eurons are not all alike; they vary in shape, size, gene expression, and connections. Neurons also differ from one another in their electrical properties. A few examples of the diverse behavior of neurons are shown in Figure A. The cerebral cortex has two major types of neurons as dfi ned by morphology: aspinous stellate cells and spiny pyramidal cells. A stellate cell typically responds to a steady depolarizing current injected into its soma by fi ring action potentials at a relatively steady frequency throughout the stimulus (part a). However, most pyramidal cells cannot sustain a steady fi ring rate. Instead, they fi re rapidly at the beginning of the stimulus and then slow down, even if the stimulus remains strong (part b). This slowing over time is called adaptation , a very common property among excitable cells. Another fi ring pattern is the burst, a rapid cluster of action potentials followed by a brief pause. Some cells, including a particular subtype of large pramidal neuron in the cortex, respond to a steady input with rhythmic, repetitive bursts (part c).

Surveys of many areas of the brain suggest that neurons have as large an assortment of electrical behaviors as morphologies. What accounts for the diverse behavior of different types of neurons? Ultimately, each neuron’s physiology is detemined by the properties and numbers of ion channels in its membrane. There are many more types of ion channels than the few described in this chapter, and each has distinctive properties. For example, some potassium channels activate only very slowly. A neuron with a high density of these will show adaptation because during a prolonged stimulus, more and more of the slow potassium channels will open, and the outward currents they progressively generate will tend to hyperpolarize the membrane. When you realize that a single neuron may have more than a dozen types of ion channels, the source of diverse fi ring behavior becomes clear. It is the complex interactions among multiple ion channels that create the eclectic electric signature of each class of neuron. 107 CHAPTER 4 THE ACTION POTENTIAL K E Y T E R M S Properties of the Action Potential rising phase (p. 82) overshoot (p. 82) falling phase (p. 82) undershoot (p. 82) after-hyperpolarization (p. 82) threshold (p. 84) absolute refractory period (p. 85) relative refractory period (p. 86) optogenetics (p. 86) channelrhodopsin-2, ChR2 (p. 87) The Action Potential, in Reality voltage clamp (p. 92) voltage-gated sodium channel (p. 92) patch clamp (p. 94) channelopathy (p. 96) tetrodotoxin (TTX) (p. 96) voltage-gated potassium channel (p. 98) Action Potential Conduction saltatory conduction (p. 104) Action Potentials, Axons, and Dendrites spike-initiation zone (p. 105) CONCLUDING REMARKS Let’s return briefl y to the example in Chapter 3 of stepping on a thumbtack.

The breaking of the skin caused by the tack stretches the sensory nerve endings of the foot. Special ion channels that are sensitive to the stretching of the membrane open and allow positively charged sodium ions to enter the ends of the axons in the skin. This infl ux of positive charge depolarizes the membrane to threshold, and the action potential is generated. The positive charge that enters during the rising phase of the action potential spreads along the axon and depolarizes the membrane ahead to threshold. In this way, the action potential is continuously regenerated as it sweeps like a wave along the sensory axon. We now come to the step where this information is distributed to and integrated by other neurons in the central nervous system. This transfer of information from one neuron to another is called synaptic transmission , the subject of the next two chapters. It should come as no surprise that synaptic transmission, like the action potential, depends on specialized proteins in the neuronal membrane. Thus, a picture begins to emerge of the brain as a complicated mesh of interacting neuronal membranes. Consider that a typical neuron with all its neurites has a membrane surface area of about 250,000 m 2 . The surface area of the 85 billion neurons that make up the human brain comes to 21,250 m 2 — roughly the size of three soccer fi elds.

First, specialized ion channels of the sensory nerve endings allow positive charge to enter the axon. If this depolarization reaches threshold, then action potentials are generated. Because the axonal membrane is excitable and has voltage-gated sodium channels, action potentials can propagate witout decrement up the long sensory nerves. For this information to be prcessed by the rest of the nervous system, however, these neural signals must be passed on to other neurons—for example, the motor neurons that control muscle contraction, as well as neurons in the brain and spinal cord that lead to a coordinated refl ex response. By the end of the nineteenth cetury, it was recognized that this transfer of information from one neuron to another occurs at specialized sites of contact. In 1897, English physiologist Charles Sherrington gave these sites their name: synapses. The process of information transfer at a synapse is called synaptic transmission",

The physical nature of synaptic transmission was debated for almost a century. One attractive hypothesis, which nicely explained the speed of synaptic transmission, was that it was simply electrical current fl owing from one neuron to the next. The existence of such electrical synapses was fi nally proven in the late 1950s by Edwin Furshpan and David Potter, American physiologists who were studying the nervous system of crayfi sh at University College London, and Akira Watanabe, who was studying the neurons of lobster at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University. We now know that electrical synapses are common in the brains of invertebrates and vertebrates, including mammals. An alternative hypothesis about the nature of synaptic transmission, also dating back to the 1800s, was that chemical neurotransmitters tranfer information from one neuron to another at the synapse. Solid support for the concept of chemical synapses was provided in 1921 by Otto Loewi, then the head of the Pharmacology Department at the University of Graz in Austria. Loewi showed that electrical stimulation of axons innervating the frog’s heart caused the release of a chemical that could mimic the effects of neuron stimulation on the heartbeat (Box 5.1). Later, Bernard Katz and his colleagues at University College London conclusively demonstrated that fast transmission at the synapse between a motor neuron axon and skeletal muscle was chemically mediated. By 1951, John Eccles of the Australian National University was studying the physiology of synaptic transmission within the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) using a new tool, the glass microelectrode. These experiments indicated that many CNS syapses also use a chemical transmitter; in fact, chemical synapses comprise the majority of synapses in the brain",

During the last decade, new methods of studying the molecules involved in synaptic transmission have revealed that synapses are far more complex than most neuroscientists anticipated. Synaptic transmission is a large and fascinating topic. The actions of pschoactive drugs, the causes of mental disorders, the neural bases of learning and memory—indeed, all the operations of the nervous system—cannot be understood without knowledge of synaptic transmission. Therefore, we’ve devoted several chapters to this topic, mainly focusing on chemical synapses. In this chapter, we begin by exploring the basic mechanisms of synaptic transmission. What do different types of synapse look like? How are nerotransmitters synthesized and stored, and how are they released in response to an action potential in the axon terminal? How do neurotransmitters act on the postsynaptic membrane? How do single neurons integrate the inputs provided by the thousands of synapses that impinge upon them?

The heart has two types of innervation; one type speeds the beating of the heart, and the other slows it. The latter type of innervation is supplied by the vagus nerve. Loewi isolated a frog heart with the vagal innervation still intact, stimulated the nerve electrically, and observed the expected effect: the slowing of the heartbeat. The critical demonstration that this effect was chemically mediated came when he applied the solution that had bathed this heart to a second isolated frog heart and found that the beating of this one also slowed",

    "chunk_text": ". The idea for this experiment had actually come to Loewi in a dream. Below is his own account: In the night of Easter Sunday, 1921, I awoke, turned on the light, and jotted down a few notes on a tiny slip of paper. Then, I fell asleep again. It occurred to me at six o’clock in the morning that during the night I had written down something most important, but I was unable to decpher the scrawl. That Sunday was the most desperate day in my whole scientifi c life. During the next night, however, I awoke again, at three o’clock, and I remembered what it was. This time I did not take any risk; I got up immdiately, went to the laboratory, made the experiment on the frog’s heart, described above, and at fi ve o’clock the chemical transmission of the nervous impulse was conclsively provedCareful consideration in daytime would undoubtedly have rejected the kind of experiment I peformed, because it would have seemed most unlikely that if a nervous impulse released a transmitting agent, it would do so not just in suffi cient quantity to infl uence the effetor organ, in my case the heart, but indeed in such an ecess that it could partly escape into the fl uid which fi lled the heart, and could therefore be detected. Yet the whole nocturnal concept of the experiment was based on this eventuality, and the result proved to be positive, contrary to expectation. (Loewi, 1953, pp. 33–34.) The active compound, which Loewi called vagusstoff (literally “vagus substance” in German), turned out to be acetylcholine. As we see in this chapter, acetylcholine is also a transmitter at the synapse between nerve and skeletal muscle. Unlike at the heart, acetylcholine applied to skeletal muscle causes excitation and contraction. TYPES OF SYNAPSES We introduced the synapse in Chapter 2. A synapse is the specialized junction where one part of a neuron contacts and communicates with aother neuron or cell type (such as a muscle or glandular cell). Information generally fl ows in one direction, from a neuron to its target cell",

    "chunk_text": ". Information generally fl ows in one direction, from a neuron to its target cell. The fi rst neuron is said to be presynaptic , and the target cell is said to be postsynaptic . Let’s take a closer look at the different types of synapse. Electrical Synapses Electrical synapses are relatively simple in structure and function, and they allow the direct transfer of ionic current from one cell to the next. Electrical synapses occur at specialized sites called gap junctions . Gap junctions occur between cells in nearly every part of the body and interconnect many non-neural cells, including epithelial cells, smooth and cardiac muscle cells, liver cells, some glandular cells, and glia. When gap junctions interconnect neurons, they can function as electrcal synapses. At a gap junction, the membranes of two cells are separated by only about 3 nm, and this narrow gap is spanned by clusters of special proteins called connexins . There are about 20 different subtypes of conexins, about half of which occur in the brain. Six connexin subunits cobine to form a channel called a connexon , and two connexons (one from each cell) meet and combine to form a gap junction channel (Figure 5.1). The channel allows ions to pass directly from the cytoplasm of one cell T Y P E S O F S Y NA P S ES 112 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS to the cytoplasm of the other. The pore of most gap junction channels is relatively large. Its diameter is about 1–2 nm, big enough for all the major cellular ions and many small organic molecules to pass through. Most gap junctions allow ionic current to pass equally well in both directions; therefore, unlike the vast majority of chemical synapses, eletrical synapses are bidirectional. Because electrical current (in the form of ions) can pass through these channels, cells connected by gap junctions are said to be electrically coupled . Transmission at electrical synapses is very fast and, if the synapse is large, nearly fail-safe",

    "chunk_text": ". Transmission at electrical synapses is very fast and, if the synapse is large, nearly fail-safe. Thus, an action potential in the presynaptic neuron can produce, with very little delay, an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron. In invertebrate species, such as the crayfi sh, electrical synapses are sometimes found between sensory and motor neurons in neural pathways mediating escape refl exes. This mechanism enables an animal to beat a hasty retreat when faced with a dangerous situation. Studies in recent years have revealed that electrical synapses are common in every part of the mammalian CNS (Figure 5.2a). When two neurons are electrically coupled, an action potential in the presynaptic neuron causes a small amount of ionic current to fl ow across the gap juntion channels into the other neuron. This current causes an electrically mediated postsynaptic potential (PSP) in the second neuron (Figure 5.2b). Note that, because most electrical synapses are bidirectional, when that second neuron generates an action potential, it will in turn induce a PSP in the fi rst neuron. The PSP generated by a single electrical syapse in the mammalian brain is usually small—about 1 mV or less at its peak—and may not, by itself, be large enough to trigger an action (a) Cell 2 Cell 1 Gap junction Cell 1 cytoplasm Cell 2 cytoplasm Ions and small molecules Channel formed by pores in each membrane (b) (c) 3.5 nm 20 nm Gap junction channels Gap junction Connexon Connexin ▼ FIGURE 5.1 A gap junction.

    "chunk_text": ". 113 CHAPTER 5 SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION potential in the postsynaptic cell. One neuron usually makes electrical synapses with many other neurons, however, so several PSPs occurring simultaneously may strongly excite a neuron. This is an example of syaptic integration, which is discussed later in the chapter. The precise roles of electrical synapses vary from one brain region to another. They are often found where normal function requires that the activity of neighboring neurons be highly synchronized. For example, nerons in a brain stem nucleus called the inferior olive can generate both small oscillations of membrane voltage and, more occasionally, action ptentials. These cells send axons to the cerebellum and are important in motor control. They also make gap junctions with one another. Current that fl ows through gap junctions during membrane oscillations and ation potentials serves to coordinate and synchronize the activity of inferior olivary neurons (Figure 5.3a), and this in turn may help to control the fi ne timing of motor control. Michael Long and Barry Connors, working at Brown University, found that genetic deletion of a critical gap junction protein called connexin36 (Cx36) did not alter the neurons’ ability to geerate oscillations and action potentials but did abolish the synchrony of these events because of the loss of functional gap junctions (Figure 5.3b). Gap junctions between neurons and other cells are particularly comon early in development. Evidence suggests that during prenatal and postnatal brain development, gap junctions allow neighboring cells to share both electrical and chemical signals that may help coordinate their growth and maturation.

(Source: Part a from Sloper and Powell, 1978.) 114 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS chemical synapses, let’s take a look at some of their universal characteistics (Figure 5.4). The presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes at chemical synapses are separated by a synaptic cleft that is 20–50 nm wide, 10 times the width of the separation at gap junctions. The cleft is fi lled with a matrix of fi brous extracellular protein. One function of this matrix is to serve as a “glue” that binds the prand postsynaptic membranes together. The presynaptic side of the synapse, also called the presynaptic element , is usually an axon terminal. The terminal typically contains dozens of small membrane-enclosed spheres, each about 50 nm in diameter, called synaptic vesicles (Figure 5.5a). These vesicles store neurotransmitter, the chemical used to communicate with the postsynaptic neuron. Many axon terminals also contain larger vesicles, each about 100 nm in diameter, called secretory granules . Secretory granules contain soluble protein that appears dark in the electron microscope, so they are sometimes called large, dense-core vesicles (Figure 5.5b)",

On the presynaptic side, proteins jutting into the cytoplasm of the terminal along the intracellular face of the mebrane sometimes look like a fi eld of tiny pyramids. The pyramids, and the membrane associated with them, are the actual sites of neurotranmitter release, called active zones . Synaptic vesicles are clustered in the cytoplasm adjacent to the active zones (see Figure 5.4). The protein thickly accumulated in and just under the postsynaptic membrane is called the postsynaptic density . The postsynaptic density contains the neurotransmitter receptors, which convert the intercellular chemical signal (i.e., neurotransmitter) into an intracellular signal (i.e., a change in membrane potential or a chemical change) in the postsynaptic cell",

CNS Chemical Synapses. In the CNS, different types of synapse may be distinguished by which part of the neuron is postsynaptic to the axon terminal. If the postsynaptic membrane is on a dendrite, the synapse is said to be axodendritic . If the postsynaptic membrane is on the cell body, the synapse is said to be axosomatic . In some cases, the postsynaptic membrane is on another axon, and these synapses are called axoaxonic (Figure 5.6). When a presynaptic axon contacts a postsynaptic dendritic spine, it is called axospinous (Figure 5.7a).

I was a graduate student in the new nerobiology and behavior program at the University of Illinois, and it was indeed an exciting time in neuroscience. The 1979 Society for Neuroscience meeting had only about 5,000 atendees (attendance is now about 25,000), and the member number I obtained during my fi rst year of graduate school was and remains 2500.

Eagerly, I developed a high-throughput project, preparing the brains from many rats at once, sectioning through the whole brains, checking that the silver staining had worked, and then storing the tissue sections in butanol while engaging undegraduates to help mount them on microscope slides. To our dismay, we found several months later that all the silver had been dissolved out of the cells. There were no cells to see, and the project died an untimely death. I was fortunate, however, to meet Professor Timothy Teyler at a Gordon Research Conference. He had recently brought the hippocampal slice preparation to the United States from Norway and was moving his lab from Harvard to a new medcal school in Rootstown, Ohio. I was completely enamored by the experimental control that brain slices might offer, so I dveloped a Golgi-slice procedure and moved to complete my PhD with Teyler. This time, I prepared one slice at a time, and as can be seen in Figure A, the spines were exquisitely visible. Unfortunately, accurate counts and shape measurements of the tiny spines were just beyond the resolution of light microscopy. While I was a graduate student, I talked my way into the esteemed summer course in neurobiology at the Marine Biological Laboratories in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. There I fi rst learned serial-section three-dimensional electron microscopy (3DEM). I was truly hooked. With 3DEM, one could reconstruct dendrites, axons, and glia, and not only measure and count dendritic spines but also see where syapses formed, what was inside them, and how glia assciated with synapses (Figure B). The 3DEM platform offers enormous possibilities for discovery.

Early in my career, while the revolution of molecular biology was sweeping the fi eld, only a rare student or fellow scietist shared my enthusiasm for 3DEM. That bias has shifted dramatically as neuroscientists have come to recognize the importance of understanding how molecules work in consort with intracellular organelles in small spaces like dendrites and spines. Furthermore, all maps of neural circuitry must include synapses. These endeavors have drawn scientists from nearly every fi eld, making 3DEM even more exciting as many of the imaging and reconstruction processes previously done maually are being automated. Figure C shows a recent 3DEM rendering, with color-coding of organelles and synaptic coponents. It is indeed thrilling to be part of this growth. New fi ndings abound regarding the plasticity of synapse structure during normal changes in brain function and as altered by diseases that tragically affect who we are as human beings.

Chemical synapses also occur between the axons of motor neurons of the spinal cord and skeletal muscle. Such a synapse is called a neuromuscular junction , and it has many of the structural features of chemical synapses in the CNS (Figure 5.9). Neuromuscular synaptic transmission is fast and reliable. An action potential in the motor axon always causes an action potential in the mucle cell it innervates. This reliability is accounted for, in part, by strutural specializations of the neuromuscular junction. Its most important specialization is its size—it is one of the largest synapses in the body. The presynaptic terminal also contains a large number of active zones. In addition, the postsynaptic membrane, also called the motor enplate , contains a series of shallow folds. The presynaptic active zones are precisely aligned with these junctional folds, and the postsynaptic membrane of the folds is packed with neurotransmitter receptors. This structure ensures that many neurotransmitter molecules are focally released onto a large surface of chemically sensitive membrane. Because neuromuscular junctions are more accessible to researchers than CNS synapses, much of what we know about the mechanisms of synaptic transmission was fi rst established here. Neuromuscular juntions are also of considerable clinical signifi cance; diseases, drugs, and poisons that interfere with this chemical synapse have direct effects on vital bodily functions.

And, to be useful for senstion, perception, and the control of movement, all these things must often occur very rapidly, within milliseconds. No wonder physiologists were intially skeptical about the existence of chemical synapses in the brain! Fortunately, thanks to several decades of research on the topic, we now understand how many of these aspects of synaptic transmission are so effi ciently carried out. Here we’ll present a general survey of the basic principles. In Chapter 6, we will take a more detailed look at the indvidual neurotransmitters and their modes of postsynaptic action.

The speed of synaptic transmission varies widely. Fast forms of synaptic transmission last from about 10–100 msec, and at most CNS synapses are mediated by the amino acids glutamate (Glu) , gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) , or glycine (Gly) . The amine acetylcholine (ACh) medates fast synaptic transmission at all neuromuscular junctions. Slower forms of synaptic transmission may last from hundreds of milliseconds to minutes; they can occur in the CNS and in the periphery and are medated by transmitters from all three chemical categories. Neurotransmitter Synthesis and Storage Chemical synaptic transmission requires that neurotransmitters be synthsized and ready for release. Different neurotransmitters are synthesized in different ways. For example, glutamate and glycine are among the 20 amino acids that are the building blocks of protein (see Figure 3.4b); consequently, they are abundant in all cells of the body, including neurons. In contrast, GABA and the amines are made primarily by the neurons that release them. These neurons contain specifi c enzymes that synthesize the neurotransmiters from various metabolic precursors. The synthesizing enzymes for both amino acid and amine neurotransmitters are transported to the axon termnal, where they locally and rapidly direct transmitter synthesis. Once synthesized in the cytosol of the axon terminal, the amino acid and amine neurotransmitters must be taken up by the synaptic vesicles. Concentrating these neurotransmitters inside the vesicle is the job of transporters , special proteins embedded in the vesicle membrane. Quite different mechanisms are used to synthesize and store peptides in secretory granules. As we learned in Chapters 2 and 3, peptides are formed when amino acids are strung together by the ribosomes of the cell body",

    "chunk_text": ". As we learned in Chapters 2 and 3, peptides are formed when amino acids are strung together by the ribosomes of the cell body. In the case of peptide neurotransmitters, this occurs in the rough ER. Generally, a long peptide synthesized in the rough ER is split in the Golgi apparatus, and one of the smaller peptide fragments is the active neurotransmitter. Secretory granules containing the peptide neurotransmitter bud off from the Golgi apparatus and are carried to the axon terminal by axoplasmic transport. Figure 5.11 compares the synthesis and storage of amine and amino acid neurotransmitters with that of peptide neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitter Release Neurotransmitter release is triggered by the arrival of an action potetial in the axon terminal. The depolarization of the terminal membrane causes voltage-gated calcium channels in the active zones to open. These membrane channels are very similar to the sodium channels we discussed in Chapter 4, except they are permeable to Ca 2 instead of Na . There is a large inward driving force on Ca 2 . Remember that the internal calcium ion concentration—[Ca 2 ] i —at rest is very low, only 0.0002 mM; therefore, Ca 2 will fl ood the cytoplasm of the axon terminal as long as the calcium channels are open. The resulting elevation in [Ca 2 ] i is the signal that causes neurotransmitter to be released from synaptic vesicles. The vesicles release their contents by a process called exocytosis . The membrane of the synaptic vesicle fuses to the presynaptic membrane at the active zone, allowing the contents of the vesicle to spill out into the synaptic cleft (Figure 5.12)",

    "chunk_text": ". Synapses in mammals, which geneally occur at higher temperatures, are even faster. Exocytosis is quick bcause Ca 2 enters at the active zone precisely where synaptic vesicles are ready and waiting to release their contents. In this local “microdomain” around the active zone, calcium can achieve relatively high concentrtions (greater than about 0.01 mM). The mechanism by which [Ca 2 ] i stimulates exocytosis has been under intensive investigation. The speed of neurotransmitter release suggests that the vesicles involved are those already “docked” at the active zones. Docking is believed to involve interactions between proteins in the synatic vesicle membrane and the presynaptic cell membrane under the active zone (Box 5.3). In the presence of high [Ca 2 ] i , these proteins alter their conformation so that the lipid bilayers of the vesicle and presynaptic mebranes fuse, forming a pore that allows the neurotransmitter to escape into the cleft. The mouth of this exocytotic fusion pore continues to expand until the membrane of the vesicle is fully incorporated into the presynaptic mebrane (Figure 5.13). The vesicle membrane is later recovered by the process of endocytosis , and the recycled vesicle is refi lled with neurotransmitter (see Figure 5.12). During periods of prolonged stimulation, vesicles are mbilized from a “reserve pool” that is bound to the cytoskeleton of the axon terminal. The release of these vesicles from the cytoskeleton, and their docking to the active zone, is also triggered by elevations of [Ca 2 ] i . Secretory granules also release peptide neurotransmitters by excytosis, in a calcium-dependent fashion, but typically not at the active zones. Because the sites of granule exocytosis occur at a distance from the sites of Ca 2 entry, peptide neurotransmitters are usually not released in response to every action potential invading the terminal",

    "chunk_text": ". Instead, the release of peptides generally requires high-frequency trains of action potentials, so that the [Ca 2 ] i throughout the terminal can build to the level required to trigger release away from the active zones. Unlike the fast release of amino acid and amine neurotransmitters, the release of peptides is a leisurely process, taking 50 msec or more. Neurotransmitter Receptors and Effectors Neurotransmitters released into the synaptic cleft affect the postsynaptic neuron by binding to specifi c receptor proteins that are embedded in the postsynaptic density. The binding of neurotransmitter to the receptor is like inserting a key in a lock; this causes conformational changes in the protein such that the protein can then function differently. Although there are well over 100 different neurotransmitter receptors, they can be classifi ed into two types: transmitter-gated ion channels and G-protein-coupled receptors. Transmitter-Gated Ion Channels. Receptors known as transmitter-gated ion channels are membrane-spanning proteins consisting of four or fi ve subunits that come together to form a pore between them (Figure 5.14). In the absence of neurotransmitter, the pore is usually closed. When nerotransmitter binds to specifi c sites on the extracellular region of the channel, it induces a conformational change—just a slight twist of the subunits—which within microseconds causes the pore to open. The funtional consequence of this depends on which ions can pass through the pore. Transmitter-gated channels generally do not show the same degree of ion selectivity as do voltage-gated channels. For example, the ACh-gated ion channels at the neuromuscular junction are permeable to both Na and K . Nonetheless, as a rule, if the open channels are permeable to 125 CHAPTER 5 SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION BOX 5.3 How to SNARE a Vesicle Y easts are single-cell organisms valued for their abiity to make dough rise and grape juice ferment into wine",

    "chunk_text": ". Remarkably, the humble yeasts have some close similarities to the chemical synapses in our brain. Recent research has shown that the proteins controlling secretion in both yeast cells and synapses have only minor differences. Apparently, these molecules are so generally useful that they have been conserved across more than a billion years of evolution, and they are found in all eukaryotic cells. The trick to fast synaptic function is to deliver neurotranmitter-fi lled vesicles to just the right place—the presynaptic membrane—and then cause them to fuse at just the right time, when an action potential delivers a pulse of high Ca 2 concetration to the cytosol. This process of exocytosis is a special case of a more general cellular problem, membrane traffi cking . Cells have many types of membranes, including those encloing the whole cell, the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and various types of vesicles. To avoid intracellular chaos, each of these membranes needs to be moved and deliered to specifi c locations within the cell. After delivery, one type of membrane often has to fuse with another type. A common molecular machinery has evolved for the delivery and fusion of all these membranes, and small variations in these molecules determine how and when membrane traffi cking takes place. The specifi c binding and fusion of membranes seem to depend on the SNARE family of proteins, which were fi rst found in yeast cells. SNARE is an acronym too convoluted to defi ne here, but the name perfectly defi nes the function of these proteins: SNAREs allow one membrane to snare aother. Each SNARE peptide has a lipid-loving end that ebeds itself within the membrane and a longer tail that projects into the cytosol. Vesicles have “v-SNAREs,” and the outer membrane has “t-SNAREs” (for target membrane). The ctosolic ends of these two complementary types of SNAREs can bind very tightly to one another, allowing a vesicle to “dock” very close to a presynaptic membrane and nowhere else (Figure A)",

Although complexes of v-SNAREs and t-SNAREs form the main connection between vesicle membrane and target membrane, a large and bewildering array of other presyaptic proteins stick to this SNARE complex. We still don’t understand the functions of all of them, but synaptotagmin , a vesicle protein, is the critical Ca 2 sensor that rapidly trigers vesicle fusion and thus transmitter release. On the prsynaptic membrane side, calcium channels may form part of the docking complex. As the calcium channels are very close to the docked vesicles, infl owing Ca 2 can trigger transmiter release with astonishing speed—within about 60 sec in a mammalian synapse at body temperature. The brain has several varieties of synaptotagmins, including one that is spcialized for exceptionally fast synaptic transmission. We have a way to go before we understand all the moecules involved in synaptic transmission. In the meantime, we can count on yeasts to provide delightful brain food (and drink) for thought.

If the transmitter-gated channels are permeable to Cl , the usual net effect will be to hyperpolarize the postsynaptic cell from the resting mebrane potential (because the chloride equilibrium potential is usually neative; see Chapter 3). Because it tends to bring the membrane potential away from threshold for generating action potentials, this effect is said to be inhibitory . A transient hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic mebrane potential caused by the presynaptic release of neurotransmitter is called an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) (Figure 5.16). Synaptic activation of glycine-gated or GABA-gated ion channels cause an IPSP. We’ll discuss EPSPs and IPSPs in more detail shortly when we explore the principles of synaptic integration. G-Protein-Coupled Receptors. Fast chemical synaptic transmission is mediated by amino acid and amine neurotransmitters acting on tranmitter-gated ion channels. However, all three types of neurotransmitter, acting on G-protein-coupled receptors , can also have slower, longer lasting, and much more diverse postsynaptic actions. This type of tranmitter action involves three steps: 1. Neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptor proteins embedded in the postsynaptic membrane.

Unlike the voltage-gated channels, however, many transmitter-gated ion channels are not pemeable to a single type of ion. For example, the ACh-gated ion channel at the neuromuscular junction is permeable to both Na and K . Let’s explore the functional consequence of activating these channels. In Chapter 3, we learned that the membrane potential, V m , can be calculated using the Goldman equation, which takes into account the relative permeability of the membrane to different ions (see Box 3.3). If the membrane were equally permeable to Na and K , as it would be if many ACor glutamate-gated channels were open, then V m would have a value between E Na and E K , around 0 mV. Therefore, ionic current would fl ow through the channels in a direction that brings the membrane potential toward 0 mV. If the mebrane potential were 0 mV before ACh was applied, as is usually the case, the direction of net current fl ow through the ACh-gated ion channels would be inward , causing a depolarization. However, if the membrane potential were 0 mV before ACh was applied, the direction of net current fl ow through the ACh-gated ion channels would be outward , causing the membrane potential to become less positive. Ionic current fl ow at different membrane voltages can be graphed, as shown in Figure A. Such a graph is called an I-V plot (I: current; V: voltage)",

The critical value of membrane potential at which the direction of current fl ow reverses is called the reversal potential . In this case, the reversal potential would be 0 mV. The experimental determination of a revesal potential, therefore, helps tell us which types of ions the membrane is permeable to. If, by changing the relative permeability of the membrane to different ions, a neurotransmitter causes V m to move tward a value that is more positive than the action potential threshold, the neurotransmitter action would be termed excitatory. As a rule, neurotransmitters that open a chanel permeable to Na are excitatory. If a neurotransmitter causes V m to take on a value that is more negative than the action potential threshold, the neurotransmitter action would be termed inhibitory. Neurotransmitters that open a channel permeable to Cl tend to be inhibitory, as are neurotransmiters that open a channel permeable only to K .

Second messengers can activate additional enzymes in the cytosol that can regulate ion channel function and alter cellular metabolism.

Because G-protein-coupled receptors can trigger widespread metabolic effects, they are often referred to as metabotropic receptors . 128 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS We’ll discuss the different neurotransmitters, their receptors, and their effectors in more detail in Chapter 6. However, you should be aware that the same neurotransmitter can have different postsynaptic actions, dpending on what receptors it binds to. An example is the effect of ACh on the heart and on skeletal muscles. ACh slows the rhythmic contractions of the heart by causing a slow hyperpolarization of the cardiac muscle cells. In contrast, in skeletal muscle, ACh induces contraction by cauing a rapid depolarization of the muscle fi bers. These different actions are explained by the different receptors involved. In the heart, a metabtropic ACh receptor is coupled by a G-protein to a potassium channel. The opening of the potassium channel hyperpolarizes the cardiac muscle fi bers and reduces the rate at which it fi res action potentials. In skeletal muscle, the receptor is a transmitter-gated ion channel, specifi cally an ACh-gated ion channel, permeable to Na . The opening of this channel depolarizes the muscle fi bers and makes them more excitable. Autoreceptors.

The consequences of activating these receptors vary, but a common effect is inhibition of neurotransmiter release and, in some cases, neurotransmitter synthesis. This allows a presynaptic terminal to regulate itself. Autoreceptors appear to function as a sort of safety valve to reduce release when the concentration of nerotransmitter around the presynaptic terminal gets too high",

Neurotransmitter Recovery and Degradation Once the released neurotransmitter has interacted with postsynaptic receptors, it must be cleared from the synaptic cleft to allow another round of synaptic transmission. One way this happens is by simple diffsion of the transmitter molecules through the extracellular fl uid and away from the synapse. For most of the amino acid and amine neurotransmiters, however, diffusion is aided by their reuptake into the presynaptic axon terminal. Reuptake occurs by the action of specifi c neurotransmitter transporter proteins located in the presynaptic membrane. Once inside the cytosol of the terminal, the transmitters may be reloaded into syaptic vesicles or enzymatically degraded and their breakdown products recycled. Neurotransmitter transporters also exist in the membranes of glia surrounding the synapse, which assist in the removal of neurotranmitter from the cleft. Neurotransmitter action can also be terminated by enzymatic destrution in the synaptic cleft itself. This is how ACh is removed at the neurmuscular junction, for example. The enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is deposited in the cleft by the muscle cells. AChE cleaves the ACh moecule, rendering it inactive at the ACh receptors. The importance of transmitter removal from the cleft should not be uderestimated. At the neuromuscular junction, for example, uninterrupted exposure to high concentrations of ACh after several seconds leads to a process called desensitization , in which, despite the continued presence of ACh, the transmitter-gated channels close. This desensitized state can persist for many seconds even after the neurotransmitter is removed. The rapid destruction of ACh by AChE normally prevents desensitization from occurring",

The rapid destruction of ACh by AChE normally prevents desensitization from occurring. However, if the AChE is inhibited, as it is by various nerve gases used as chemical weapons, the ACh receptors will become desensitized and neuromuscular transmission will fail. Neuropharmacology Each of the steps of synaptic transmission we have discussed so far—nerotransmitter synthesis, loading into synaptic vesicles, exocytosis, bining and activation of receptors, reuptake, and degradation—is chemical, and therefore these steps can be affected by specifi c drugs and toxins (Box 5.5). The study of the effects of drugs on nervous system tissue is called neuropharmacology . Earlier, we mentioned that nerve gases can interfere with synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by inhibiting the enzyme AChE. This interference represents one class of drug action, which is to inhibit the normal function of specifi c proteins involved in synaptic tranmission; such drugs are called inhibitors . Inhibitors of neurotransmitter receptors, called receptor antagonists , bind to the receptors and block (antagonize) the normal action of the transmitter. An example of a recetor antagonist is curare, an arrow-tip poison traditionally used by South American natives to paralyze their prey. Curare binds tightly to the ACh 131 CHAPTER 5 SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION receptors on skeletal muscle cells and blocks the actions of ACh, thereby preventing muscle contraction. Other drugs bind to receptors, but instead of inhibiting them, they mimic the actions of the naturally occurring neurotransmitter. These drugs are called receptor agonists . An example of a receptor agonist is nicotine, derived from the tobacco plant. Nicotine binds to and activates the ACh receptors in skeletal muscle",

Nicotine binds to and activates the ACh receptors in skeletal muscle. In fact, the ACh-gated ion channels in muscle are also called nicotinic ACh receptors , to distinguish them from other types of ACh receptors, such as those in the heart, that are not activated by nicotine. There are also nicotinic ACh receptors in the CNS, and these are involved in the addictive effects of tobacco use. The immense chemical complexity of synaptic transmission makes it especially susceptible to the medical corollary of Murphy’s law, which O F S P E C I A L I N T E R E S T BOX 5.5 Bacteria, Spiders, Snakes, and People W hat do the bacteria Clostridium botulinum , black widow spiders, cobras, and humans have in common? They all produce toxins that attack the chemical synaptic transmision that occurs at the neuromuscular junction. Botulism is caused by several kinds of botulinum neurotoxins that are produced by the growth of C. botulinum in improperly canned foods. (The name comes from the Latin word for “sausage” because of the early association of the disease with poorly preserved meat.) Botulinum toxins are very potent blockers of neuromuscular transmission; it has been estimated that as few as 10 molecules of the toxins are enough to inhibit a cholinergic synapse. Botulinum toxins are extraordinarily specifi c enzymes that destroy certain of the SNARE proteins in the presynaptic terminals, which are critical for transmitter release (see Box 5.3). This specifi c action of the toxins made them important tools in the early research on SNAREs. Although its mechanism of action is different, black widow spider venom also exerts deadly effects by affecting transmiter release (Figure A). The venom contains latrotoxin, which fi rst increases, and then eliminates, ACh release at the neromuscular junction",

Electron microscopic examination of synapses poisoned with black widow spider venom reveals that the axon terminals are swollen and the synaptic vesicles are missing. The action of latrotoxin, a protein molecule, is not entirely understood. Venom binds with proteins on the outside of the presynaptic membrane and forms a membrane pore that depolarizes the terminal and allows Ca 2 to enter and trigger rapid and total depletion of transmitter. In some cases, the venom can induce transmitter release even witout the need for Ca 2 , perhaps by interacting directly with neurotransmitter release proteins. The bite of the Taiwanese cobra also results in the blocade of neuromuscular transmission in its victim, by yet aother mechanism. One of the active compounds in the snake’s venom, called -bungarotoxin , is a peptide that binds so tightly to the postsynaptic nicotinic ACh receptors that it takes days to be removed. Often, there is not time for its rmoval, however, because cobra toxin prevents the activation of nicotinic receptors by ACh, thereby paralyzing the respirtory muscles of its victims. We humans have synthesized a large number of chemcals that poison synaptic transmission at the neuromusclar junction. Originally motivated by the search for chemical warfare agents, this effort led to the development of a new class of compounds called organophosphates . These are irreversible inhibitors of AChE. By preventing the degradation of ACh, they cause it to accumulate and probably kill victims by causing a desensitization of ACh receptors. The organphosphates used today as insecticides, like parathion, are toxic to humans only in high doses. Figure A Black widow spiders.

Defective neurotransmission is believed to be the root cause of a large number of neurological and psychiatric disorders. The good news is that, thanks to our growing knowledge of the neuropharmacology of syaptic transmission, clinicians have new and increasingly effective therpeutic drugs for treating these disorders. We’ll discuss the synaptic basis of some psychiatric disorders, and their neuropharmacological treatment, in Chapter 22. PRINCIPLES OF SYNAPTIC INTEGRATION Most CNS neurons receive thousands of synaptic inputs that activate different combinations of transmitter-gated ion channels and G-proteicoupled receptors. The postsynaptic neuron integrates all these complex ionic and chemical signals to produce a simple form of output: action ptentials. The transformation of many synaptic inputs to a single neuronal output constitutes a neural computation. The brain performs billions of neural computations every second we are alive. As a fi rst step toward uderstanding how neural computations are performed, let’s explore some basic principles of synaptic integration. Synaptic integration is the process by which multiple synaptic potentials combine within one possynaptic neuron. The Integration of EPSPs The most elementary postsynaptic response is the opening of a single transmitter-gated channel (Figure 5.18). Inward current through these channels depolarizes the postsynaptic membrane, causing the EPSP. The postsynaptic membrane of one synapse may have from a few tens to several thousands of transmitter-gated channels; how many of these are activated during synaptic transmission depends mainly on how much neurotransmitter is released.

(Source: Adapted from Neher and Sakmann, 1992.) 133 CHAPTER 5 SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION Consequently, the amplitude of the postsynaptic EPSP is some multiple of the response to the contents of a single vesicle. Stated another way, possynaptic EPSPs at a given synapse are quantized ; they are multiples of an indivisible unit, the quantum , which refl ects the number of transmiter molecules in a single synaptic vesicle and the number of postsynaptic receptors available at the synapse. At many synapses, exocytosis of vesicles occurs at some very low rate in the absence of presynaptic stimulation. The size of the postsynaptic rsponse to this spontaneously released neurotransmitter can be measured electrophysiologically. This tiny response is a miniature postsynaptic potential , often called simply a mini . Each mini is generated by the transmitter contents of one vesicle. The amplitude of the postsynaptic EPSP evoked by a presynaptic action potential, then, is simply an integer multiple (i.e., 1 , 2 , 3 , etc.) of the mini amplitude.

Quantal analysis , a method of comparing the amplitudes of miniture and evoked PSPs, can be used to determine how many vesicles rlease neurotransmitter during normal synaptic transmission. Quantal analysis of transmission at the neuromuscular junction reveals that a single action potential in the presynaptic terminal triggers the exocytosis of about 200 synaptic vesicles, causing an EPSP of 40 mV or more. At many CNS synapses, in striking contrast, the contents of only a single vesicle are released in response to a presynaptic action potential, causing an EPSP of only a few tenths of a millivolt. EPSP Summation. The difference between excitatory transmission at neuromuscular junctions and CNS synapses is not surprising. The neromuscular junction has evolved to be fail-safe; it needs to work every time, and the best way to ensure this is to generate an EPSP of a huge size. On the other hand, if every CNS synapse were, by itself, capable of triggering an action potential in its postsynaptic cell (as the neuromusclar junction can), then a neuron would be little more than a simple relay station. Instead, most neurons perform more sophisticated computations, requiring that many EPSPs add together to produce a signifi cant possynaptic depolarization. This is what is meant by integration of EPSPs. EPSP summation represents the simplest form of synaptic integrtion in the CNS. There are two types of summation: spatial and teporal. Spatial summation is the adding together of EPSPs generated simultaneously at many different synapses on a dendrite. Temporal summation is the adding together of EPSPs generated at the same synapse if they occur in rapid succession, within about 1–15 msec of one another (Figure 5.19). The Contribution of Dendritic Properties to Synaptic Integration Even with the summation of several EPSPs on a dendrite, the depolaization still may not be enough to cause the neuron to fi re an action ptential",

The current entering at the sites of synaptic contact must spread down the dendrite and through the soma and cause the membrane of the spike-initiation zone to be depolarized beyond threshold, before an action potential can be generated. The effectiveness of an excitatory synapse in triggering an action potential, therefore, depends on how far the synapse is from the spike-initiation zone and on the properties of the dendritic membrane. Dendritic Cable Properties. To simplify the analysis of how dendritic properties contribute to synaptic integration, let’s assume that dendrites 134 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS function as cylindrical cables that are electrically passive, that is, lacing voltage-gated ion channels (in contrast, of course, with axons). Using an analogy introduced in Chapter 4, imagine that the infl ux of positive charge at a synapse is like turning on the water that will fl ow down a leaky garden hose (the dendrite). There are two paths the water can take: down the inside of the hose or through the leaks. By the same token, there are two paths that synaptic current can take: down the inside of the dedrite or across the dendritic membrane. As the current proceeds down the dendrite and farther from the synapse, the EPSP amplitude will dimiish because of the leakage of ionic current through membrane channels. At some distance from the site of current infl ux, the EPSP amplitude may eventually approach zero. The decrease in depolarization as a function of distance along a dedritic cable is plotted in Figure 5.20. In order to simplify the matematics, in this example, we’ll assume the dendrite is infi nitely long, unbranched, and uniform in diameter. We will also use a microeletrode to inject a long, steady pulse of current to induce a membrane depolarization.

Just as water will fl ow farther down a wide hose with few leaks, synaptic current will fl ow farther down a wide dendrite (low r i ) with few open membrane channels (high r m ). The internal resistance depends only on the diameter of the dendrite and the electrical properties of the cytoplasm; consequently, it is reltively constant in a mature neuron. The membrane resistance, in cotrast, depends on the number of open ion channels, which changes from moment to moment depending on what other synapses are active.

Some dendrites in the brain have nearly passive and inexcitable membranes and thus do follow the simple cable equations. The dendrites of spinal motor nerons, for example, are very close to passive. However, most dendrites are decidedly not passive. A variety of neurons have dendrites with signifi - cant numbers of voltage-gated sodium, calcium, and potassium channels. Dendrites rarely have enough ion channels to generate fully propagating action potentials, as axons can. But the voltage-gated channels in dedrites can act as important amplifi ers of small PSPs generated far out on dendrites. EPSPs that would diminish to near nothingness in a long, passive dendrite may nevertheless be large enough to trigger the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels, which in turn add current to boost the synaptic signal along toward the soma. Paradoxically, in some cells, dendritic sodium channels may also carry electrical signals in the other direction, from the soma outward along dendrites. This may be a mechanism by which synapses on dendrites are informed that a spike occurred in the soma, and it has relevance for hypotheses about the cellular mechanisms of learning that will be dicussed in Chapter 25. Inhibition So far, we’ve seen that whether or not an EPSP contributes to the action potential output of a neuron depends on several factors, including the number of coactive excitatory synapses, the distance the synapse is from the spike-initiation zone, and the properties of the dendritic membrane. Of course, not all synapses in the brain are excitatory. The action of some synapses is to take the membrane potential away from action potential threshold; these are called inhibitory synapses .

The postsynaptic receptors under most inhibitory synapses are very similar to those under excitatory synapses; they’re transmitter-gated ion channels. The only important differences are that they bind different neurotransmitters (either GABA or glycine) and that they allow different ions to pass through their channels. The transmitter-gated channels of most inhibitory synapses are permeable to only one natural ion, Cl . Opening of the chloride channel allows Cl to cross the membrane in a direction that brings the membrane potential toward the chloride equilibrium potential, E Cl , about 65 mV. If the membrane potential were less negative than 65 mV when the transmiter was released, activation of these channels would cause a hyperpolaizing IPSP. Notice that if the resting membrane potential were already 65 mV, no IPSP would be visible after chloride channel activation because the value of the membrane potential would already equal E Cl (i.e., the revesal potential for that synapse; see Box 5.4). If there is no visible IPSP, is the neuron really inhibited? The answer is yes. Consider the situation illustrated in Figure 5.21, with an excitatory synapse on a distal sement of dendrite and an inhibitory synapse on a proximal segment of dendrite, near the soma. Activation of the excitatory synapse leads to the infl ux of positive charge into the dendrite. This current depolarizes the membrane as it fl ows toward the soma. At the site of the active inhibtory synapse, however, the membrane potential is approximately equal to 137 CHAPTER 5 SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION E Cl , 65 mV.

Shunting inhibition is like cutting a big hole in the leaky garden hose—more of the water fl ows down this path of least resitance, out of the hose, before it gets to the nozzle where it can “activate” the fl owers in your garden. Thus, you can see that the action of inhibitory synapses also contributes to synaptic integration. The IPSPs reduce the size of EPSPs, making the postsynaptic neuron less likely to fi re action potentials. In addition, shunting inhibition acts to drastically reduce r m and consequently , thus allowing positive current to fl ow out across the membrane instead of internally down the dendrite toward the spike-initiation zone. O F S P E C I A L I N T E R E S T BOX 5.6 Startling Mutations and Poisons A fl ash of lightning a thunderclap a tap on the shoulder when you think you’re alone! If you are not expecing them, any of these stimuli can make you jump, grimace, hunch your shoulders, and breathe faster. We all know the brief but dramatic nature of the startle response. Luckily, when lightning strikes twice or a friend taps our shoulder again, we tend to be much less startled the seond time. We quickly habituate and relax. However, for an unfortunate minority of mice, cows, dogs, horses, and peple, life is a succession of exaggerated startle responses. Even normally benign stimuli, such as hands clapping or a touch to the nose, may trigger an uncontrollable stiffening of the body, an involuntary shout, fl exion of the arms and legs, and a fall to the ground. Worse yet, these overreactions don’t adapt when the stimuli are repeated",

    "chunk_text": ". Worse yet, these overreactions don’t adapt when the stimuli are repeated. The clinical term for startle disease is hyperekplexia , and the fi rst recorded cases were members of a community of French–Canadian lumberjacks in 1878. Hyperekplexia is an inherited condition occurring worldwide, and its sufferers are known by colorful local names: the “Jumping Frenchmen of Maine” (Quebec), “myriachit” (Siberia), “latah” (Malaysia), and “Ragin’ Cajuns” (Louisiana). We now know the molecular basis for two general types of startle diseases. Remarkably, both involve defects of ihibitory glycine receptors. The fi rst type, identifi ed in humans and in a mutant mouse called spasmodic , is caused by a mutation of a gene for the glycine receptor. The change is the smallest one possible—the abnormal receptors have only one amino acid (out of more than 400) coded wrong—but the result is a chloride channel that opens less frequently when exposed to the neurotransmitter glycine. The second type of startle disease is seen in the mutant mouse spastic and in a strain of cattle. In these animals, normal glycine receptors are expressed but in fewer than normal numbers. The two forms of startle disease thus take different routes to the same unfortunate end: The transmitter glycine is less effective at inhibiting neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem. Most neural circuits depend on a delicate balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition for normal functioning. If excitation is increased or inhibition reduced, then a turblent and hyperexcitable state may result. An impairment of glycine function yields exaggerated startles; reduced GABA function can lead to the seizures of epilepsy (as discussed in Chapter 19). How can such diseases be treated? There is often a clear and simple logic. Drugs that enhance inhibition can be very helpful. The genetic mutations of the glycine system resemble strychnine poisoning. Strychnine is a powerful toxin found in the seeds and bark of certain trees and shrubs of the genus Strychnos",

    "chunk_text": ". The genetic mutations of the glycine system resemble strychnine poisoning. Strychnine is a powerful toxin found in the seeds and bark of certain trees and shrubs of the genus Strychnos . It was fi rst isolated and identifi ed chemically in the early nineteenth century. Strychnine has traditionally been used by farmers to eradicate pesky rodents and by murdeers. It has a simple mechanism of action: It is an antagonist of glycine at its receptor. Mild strychnine poisoning enhances startle and other refl exes and resembles hyperekplexia. High doses nearly eliminate glycine-mediated inhibition in circuits of the spinal cord and brain stem. This leads to uncontrollable seizures and unchecked muscular contractions, spasm and paralysis of the respiratory muscles, and ultimately, death from asphyxiation. It is a painful, agonizing way to die. Since glycine is not a transmitter in the higher centers of the brain, strycnine itself does not impair cognitive or sensory functions. 138 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS The Geometry of Excitatory and Inhibitory Synapses. Inhibitory syapses in the brain that use GABA or glycine as a neurotransmitter have a morphology characteristic of Gray’s type II (see Figure 5.8b). This struture contrasts with excitatory synapses that use glutamate, which have a Gray’s type I morphology. This correlation between structure and function has been useful for working out the geometric relationships among exciatory and inhibitory synapses on individual neurons. In addition to being spread over the dendrites, inhibitory synapses on many neurons are found clustered on the soma and near the axon hillock, where they are in an espcially powerful position to infl uence the activity of the postsynaptic neuron. Modulation Most of the postsynaptic mechanisms we’ve discussed so far involve tranmitter receptors that are, themselves, ion channels",

However, there are many synapses with G-protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptors that are not directly associated with an ion channel. Synaptic activation of these receptors does not directly evoke EPSPs and IPSPs but instead modifi es the effectiveness of EPSPs generated by other synapses with transmitter-gated channels. This type of synaptic transmission is called modulation . We’ll give you a taste for how modulation infl uences synaptic integration by exploring the effects of activating one type of G-protein-coupled receptor in the brain, the norepinephrine beta ( ) receptor. The binding of the amine neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) to the receptor triggers a cascade of biochemical events within the cell. In short, the receptor activates a G-protein that, in turn, activates an efector protein, the intracellular enzyme adenylyl cyclase",

    "chunk_text": ". In short, the receptor activates a G-protein that, in turn, activates an efector protein, the intracellular enzyme adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the chemical reaction that converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the product of oxidative metabolism in the mitochondria, into a compound called cyclic adenosine monophosphate , or cAMP , that is free to diffuse within the cytosol. Thus, the fi rst chemical message of synaptic transmision (the release of NE into the synaptic cleft) is converted by the receptor into a second message (cAMP); cAMP is an example of a second messenger. The effect of cAMP is to stimulate another enzyme known as a protein kinase. Protein kinases catalyze a chemical reaction called phosphorylation , the transfer of phosphate groups (PO 3 ) from ATP to specifi c sites on cell proteins (Figure 5.22). The signifi cance of phosphorlation is that it can change the conformation of a protein, thereby chaning that protein’s activity. In some neurons, one of the proteins that is phosphorylated when cAMP concentration rises is a particular type of potassium channel in the dendritic membrane. Phosphorylation causes this channel to close, thereby reducing the membrane K conductance. By itself, this does not cause any dramatic effects on the neuron. But consider the wider consquence: Decreasing the K conductance increases the dendritic membrane resistance and therefore increases the length constant. It is like wrapping the leaky garden hose in duct tape; more water can fl ow down the inside of the hose and less leaks out the sides. As a consequence of increasing , distant or weak excitatory synapses will become more effective in depolaizing the spike-initiation zone beyond threshold; the cell will become more excitable . Thus, the binding of NE to receptors produces little change in membrane potential but greatly increases the response produced by another neurotransmitter at an excitatory synapse",

We have described one particular G-protein-coupled receptor and the cosequences of activating it in one type of neuron. But it is important to reconize that other types of receptors can lead to the formation of other types of second messenger molecules. Activation of each of these receptor types will initiate a distinct cascade of biochemical reactions in the postsynaptic neron that do not always include phosphorylation and decreases in membrane conductance. In fact, cAMP in a different cell type with different enzymes may produce functionally opposite changes in the excitability of cells. In Chapter 6, we will describe more examples of synaptic modulation and their mechanisms. However, you can already see that modulatory forms of synaptic transmission offer an almost limitless number of ways that information encoded by presynaptic impulse activity can be tranformed and used by the postsynaptic neuron.

The action potential that arose in the sensory nerve when you stepped on that thumbtack in Chapter 3, and that swept along the axon in Chapter 4, has now reached the axon terminal in the spinal cord. The depolarization of the terminal triggered the presynaptic entry of Ca 2 through voltage-gated calcium channels, which then stimulated exoctosis of the contents of synaptic vesicles. Liberated neurotransmitter difused across the synaptic cleft and attached to specifi c receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. The transmitter (probably glutamate) caused transmitter-gated channels to open, which allowed positive charge to enter the postsynaptic dendrite. Because the sensory nerve was fi ring action potentials at a high rate, and because many synapses were actvated at the same time, the EPSPs summed to bring the spike-initiation zone of the postsynaptic neuron to threshold, and this cell then generated action potentials. If the postsynaptic cell is a motor neuron, this activity will cause the release of ACh at the neuromuscular junction and muscle contraction to jerk your foot away from the tack. If the postsynaptic cell is an interneuron that uses GABA as a neurotransmitter, the activity of the cell will result in inhibition of its synaptic targets. If this cell uses a moulatory transmitter such as NE, the activity could cause lasting changes in the excitability or metabolism of its synaptic targets. It is this rich diversity of chemical synaptic interactions that allows complex behaviors (such as shrieking with pain as you jerk up your foot) to emerge from simple stimuli (such as stepping on a thumbtack). Although we surveyed chemical synaptic transmission in this chapter, we did not cover the chemistry of synaptic transmission in any detail.

You’ll see that the chemistry of synaptic transmission warrants all this attention because defective neurotransmission is the basis for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. And virtually all psychoactive drugs, both therapeutic and illicit, exert their effects at chemical synapses.

As we have seen, some of the brain’s most important chemcal reactions are those associated with synaptic transmission. Chapter 5 introduced the general principles of chemical synaptic transmission, using a few specifi c neurotransmitters as examples. In this chapter, we will explore in more depth the variety and elegance of the major neurotranmitter systems. Neurotransmitter systems begin with neurotransmitters. In Chapter 5, we discussed the three major classes of neurotransmitters: amino acids , amines , and peptides . Even a partial list of the known transmitters, such as that appearing in Table 5.1, has more than 20 different molecules. Each of these molecules can defi ne a particular transmitter system. In addition to the molecule itself, a neurotransmitter system includes all the molecular machinery responsible for transmitter synthesis, vesicular packaging, reuptake and degradation, and transmitter action (Figure 6.1)",

To describe the cells that produce and release ACh, British pharmacologist Henry Dale introduced the term cholinergic . (Dale shared the 1936 Nobel Prize with Loewi in recognition of his neuropharmacological studies of synaptic transmission.) Dale termed the neurons that use the amine neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) noradrenergic . (NE is known as noradrenaline in United Kingdom.) The convention of using the suffi x -ergic continued when additional transmitters were identifi ed. I NT R O D U C TIO N FIGURE 6.1 Elements of neurotransmitter systems.

These adjectives are also used to idetify the various neurotransmitter systems. For example, ACh and all the molecular machinery associated with it are collectively called the cholinergic system . With this terminology in hand, we can begin our exploration of the neurotransmitter systems. We start with a discussion of the experimetal strategies that have been used to study transmitter systems. Then we will look at the synthesis and metabolism of specifi c neurotransmiters and explore how these molecules exert their postsynaptic effects. In Chapter 15, after we have learned more about the structural and functional organization of the nervous system, we’ll take another look at specifi c neurotransmitter systems in the context of their individual contributions to the regulation of brain function and behavior",

This is no simple task; the brain contains uncountable different chemicals. How can we decide which few chemicals are used as transmitters? Over the years, neuroscientists have established certain criteria that must be met for a molecule to be considered a neurotransmitter: 1. The molecule must be synthesized and stored in the presynaptic neuron. 2. The molecule must be released by the presynaptic axon terminal upon stimulation. 3. The molecule, when experimentally applied, must produce a response in the postsynaptic cell that mimics the response produced by the release of neurotransmitter from the presynaptic neuron. Let’s start by exploring some of the strategies and methods that are used to satisfy these criteria. Localization of Transmitters and TransmitteSynthesizing Enzymes The scientist often begins with little more than a hunch that a particular molecule may be a neurotransmitter. This idea may be based on observing that the molecule is concentrated in brain tissue or that the application of the molecule to certain neurons alters their action potential fi ring rate. Whatever the inspiration, the fi rst step in confi rming the hypothesis is to show that the molecule is, in fact, localized in, and synthesized by, paticular neurons. Many methods have been used to satisfy this criterion for different neurotransmitters. Two of the most important techniques used today are immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. Immunocytochemistry. The method of immunocytochemistry is used to anatomically localize particular molecules to particular cells. When the same technique is applied to thin sections of tissue, including brain, it is often referred to as immunohistochemistry . The principle behind the method is quite simple (Figure 6.2)",

The principle behind the method is quite simple (Figure 6.2). Once the neurotransmitter candidate has been chemically purifi ed, it is injected under the skin or into the bloostream of an animal where it stimulates an immune response. (Often, to evoke or enhance the immune response, the molecule is chemically S T U D Y I N G NE U R O TR A N SM IT T E R SYST EM S 146 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS coupled to a larger molecule.) One feature of the immune response is the generation of large proteins called antibodies . Antibodies can bind tightly to specifi c sites on the foreign molecule, also known as the antigen —in this case, the transmitter candidate. The best antibodies for immunoctochemistry bind very tightly to the transmitter of interest and bind very little or not at all to other chemicals in the brain. These specifi c antibody molecules can be recovered from a blood sample of the immunized anmal and chemically tagged with a colorful marker that can be seen with a microscope. When these labeled antibodies are applied to a section of brain tissue, they will color just those cells that contain the transmiter candidate (Figure 6.3a). By using several different antibodies, each labeled with a different marker color, it is possible to distinguish several types of cells in the same region of the brain (Figure 6.3b). Immunocytochemistry can be used to localize any molecule for which a specifi c antibody can be generated, including the synthesizing enzymes for transmitter candidates. Demonstration that the transmitter canddate and its synthesizing enzyme are contained in the same neuron—or better yet, in the same axon terminal—can help satisfy the criterion that the molecule be localized in, and synthesized by, a particular neuron. In Situ Hybridization. The method known as in situ hybridization is also useful for confi rming that a cell synthesizes a particular protein or peptide",

In order to see if the mRNA for a particular peptide is locaized in a neuron, we chemically label the appropriate probe so it can be detected, apply it to a section of brain tissue, allow time for the probes to stick to any complementary mRNA strands, then wash away all the extra probes that have not stuck. Finally, we search for neurons that contain the label. To visualize labeled cells after in situ hybridization, the probes can be chemically tagged in several ways. A common approach is to make them radioactive. Because we cannot see radioactivity, hybridized probes are detected by laying the brain tissue on a sheet of special fi lm that is sensitive to radioactive emissions. After exposure to the tissue, the fi lm is developed like a photograph, and negative images of the rdioactive cells are visible as clusters of small white dots (Figure 6.5). It is also possible to use digital electronic imaging devices to detect the radioactivity. This technique for viewing the distribution of radioactivity is called autoradiography . An alternative is to label the probes with brightly colorful fl uorescent molecules that can viewed directly with an appropriate microscope. Fluorescence in situ hybridization is also known as FISH. In summary, immunocytochemistry is a method for viewing the loction of specifi c molecules, including proteins, in sections of brain tissue. In situ hybridization is a method for localizing specifi c mRNA transcripts for proteins. Together, these methods enable us to see whether a neuron contains and synthesizes a transmitter candidate and molecules assocated with that transmitter.

In some cases, a specifi c set of cells or axons can be stimulated while taking samples of the fl uids bathing their synaptic targets. The biological activity of the sample can then be tested to see if it mimics the effect of the intact synapses, and then the sample can be chemically analyzed to reveal the structure of the active molecule. This general approach helped Loewi and Dale identify ACh as a transmiter at many peripheral synapses. Unlike the peripheral nervous system (PNS), the nervous system ouside the brain and spinal cord studied by Loewi and Dale, most regions of the central nervous system (CNS) contain a diverse mixture of intemingled synapses using different neurotransmitters",

    "chunk_text": ". Until recently, this often made it impossible to stimulate a single population of synapses cotaining only a single neurotransmitter. Researchers had to be content with stimulating many synapses in a region of the brain and collecting and measuring all the chemicals that were released. One way to do this is to use brain slices that are kept alive in vitro . To stimulate release, the slices are bathed in a solution containing a high K concentration. This treatment causes a large membrane depolarization (see Figure 3.19), thereby stimulating transmitter release from the axon terminals in the tissue. Because transmitter release requires the entry of Ca 2 into the axon terminal, it must also be shown that the release of the neurotranmitter candidate from the tissue slice after depolarization occurs only when Ca 2 ions are present in the bathing solution. New methods such as optogenetics (see Box 4.2) now make it possible to activate just one specifi c type of synapse at a time. Genetic methods are used to induce one particular population of neurons to express light-sensitive proteins, and then those neurons can be stimulated with brief fl ashes of light that have no effect on the surrounding cells. Any transmitters released are likely to have come from the optogenetically selected type of synapse. Even when it has been shown that a transmitter candidate is released upon depolarization in a calcium-dependent manner, we still cannot be sure that the molecules collected in the fl uids were released from the axon terminals; they may have been released as a secondary cosequence of synaptic activation. These technical diffi culties make the second criterion—that a transmitter candidate must be released by the presynaptic axon terminal upon stimulation—the most diffi cult to satisfy unequivocally in the CNS.

A third criterion must be met: The molecule must evoke the same response as that produced by the release of the naturally occurring neurotransmiter from the presynaptic neuron. To assess the postsynaptic actions of a transmitter candidate, a method called microiontophoresis is sometimes used. Most neurotransmitter candidates can be dissolved in solutions that will cause them to acquire a net electrical charge. A glass pipette with a very fi ne tip, just a few micrometers across, is fi lled with the ionized solution. The tip of the pipette is carefully positioned next to the postsynaptic membrane of the neuron, and the tranmitter candidate is ejected in very small amounts by passing electrical curent through the pipette.

Each of the different receptors a neurotransmitter binds to is called a receptor subtype . For example, in Chapter 5, we learned that ACh acts on two different cholinergic receptor subtypes : One type is preent in skeletal muscle, and the other is in heart muscle. Both subtypes are also present in many other organs and within the CNS. Researchers have tried almost every method of biological and chemical analysis to study the different receptor subtypes of the various neurotranmitter systems. Three approaches have proved to be particularly useful: neuropharmacological analysis of synaptic transmission, ligand-binding methods, and molecular analysis of receptor proteins. Neuropharmacological Analysis. Much of what we know about recetor subtypes was fi rst learned using neuropharmacological analysis.

Nicotinic and muscarinic receptors also exist in the brain, and some neurons have both types of receptors. Another way to distinguish receptor subtypes is to use selective antaonists. The South American arrow-tip poison curare inhibits the action of ACh at nicotinic receptors (thereby causing paralysis), and atropine , derived from belladonna plants (also known as deadly nightshade), atagonizes ACh at muscarinic receptors (Figure 6.7). (The eye drops an ophthalmologist uses to dilate your pupils are related to atropine.) Different drugs were also used to distinguish several subtypes of glutmate receptors, which mediate much of the synaptic excitation in the CNS. Three subtypes are AMPA receptors , NMDA receptors , and kainate receptors , each named for a different chemical agonist. (AMPA stands for -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate, and NMDA stands for N -methyD -aspartate.) The neurotransmitter glutamate activates all three receptor subtypes, but AMPA acts only at the AMPA receptor, NMDA acts only at the NMDA receptor, and so on (Figure 6.8).

In addition, neurophamacological analysis has been invaluable for assessing the contributions of neurotransmitter systems to brain function. Ligand-Binding Methods. As we said, the fi rst step in studying a nerotransmitter system is usually identifying the neurotransmitter. However, with the discovery in the 1970s that many drugs interact selectively with neurotransmitter receptors, researchers realized that they could use these compounds to begin analyzing receptors even before the neurotransmiter itself had been identifi ed. The pioneers of this approach were Solomon Snyder and his then student Candace Pert at Johns Hopkins University, who were interested in studying compounds called opiates (Box 6.1). Opiates are a class of drugs, derived from the opium poppy, that are both medically important and commonly abused. Opioids are the broader class of opiate-like chemicals, both natural and synthetic. Their effects include pain relief, euphoria, depressed breathing, and constipation",

The question Snyder and Pert originally set out to answer was how heroin, morphine, and other opiates exert their effects on the brain. They and others hypothesized that opiates might be agonists at specifi c receptors in neuronal membranes. To test this idea, they radioactively labeled opiate compounds and applied them in small quantities to neurnal membranes that had been isolated from different parts of the brain. If appropriate receptors existed in the membrane, the labeled opiates should bind tightly to them. This is just what they found. The radioactive drugs labeled specifi c sites on the membranes of some, but not all, nerons in the brain (Figure 6.9). Following the discovery of opioid recetors, the search was on to identify endogenous opioids, or endorphins , the naturally occurring neurotransmitters that act on these receptors. Two peptides called enkephalins were soon isolated from the brain, and they eventually proved to be opioid neurotransmitters. Any chemical compound that binds to a specifi c site on a receptor is called a ligand for that receptor (from the Latin meaning “to bind”). The technique of studying receptors using radioactively or nonradioactively labeled ligands is called the ligand-binding method . Notice that a ligand for a receptor can be an agonist, an antagonist, or the chemical neurotransmitter itself. Specifi c ligands were invaluable for isolating neurotransmitter receptors and determining their chemical structure. ▲ FIGURE 6.9 Opiate receptor binding to a slice of rat brain.

(Source: Snyder, 1986, p. 44.) 152 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS L ike so many events in science, identifying the opiate rceptors was not simply an intellectual feat accomplished in an ethereal pursuit of pure knowledge. Instead, it all began with President Nixon and his “war on drugs” in 1971, at the height of very well-publicized use of heroin by hundreds of thosands of American soldiers in Vietnam. To combat all this, Nixon appointed as czar of drug abuse research Dr. Jerome Jaffe, a psychiatrist who had pioneered in methadone treament for heroin addicts. Jaffe was to coordinate the seeral billions of federal dollars in agencies ranging from the Department of Defense to the National Institutes of Health. Jerry, a good friend, pestered me to direct our research toward the “poor soldiers” in Vietnam. So I began wondering how opiates act. The notion that drugs act at receptors, spcifi c recognition sites, had been appreciated since the turn of the century. In principle, one could identify such recetors simply by measuring the binding of radioactive drugs to tissue membranes. However, countless researchers had aplied this strategy to opiates with no success. About this time, a new Johns Hopkins faculty member, Pedro Cuatrecasas, located his laboratory adjacent to mine, and we became fast friends. Pedro had recently attained fame for his discovery of receptors for insulin. His success depended upon seemingly simple but important technical advances. Past efforts to identify receptors for hormones had failed because hormones can bind to many nonspecifi c sites, comprising proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. The numbers of these nonspecifi c sites would likely be millions of times greater than the number of specifi c receptors. To identify the “signal” of insulin receptors binding above the “noise” of nonspecifi c interactions, Pedro developed a simple fi ltration assay",

    "chunk_text": ". To identify the “signal” of insulin receptors binding above the “noise” of nonspecifi c interactions, Pedro developed a simple fi ltration assay. Since insulin should adhere more tightly to its recetors than to nonspecifi c sites, he incubated liver membranes with radioactive insulin and poured the mixture over fi lters atached to a vacuum that rapidly sucked away the incubation fl uid, leaving the membrane with attached insulin stuck to the fi lters. He then “washed” the fi lters with large volumes of saline, but did this very rapidly so as to preserve insulin bound to receptors while washing away nonspecifi c binding. Despite Pedro’s proximity, it did not immediately occur to me that the insulin success could be transferred to the opate receptor problem. Instead, I had read a paper on nerve growth factor, showing that its amino acid sequence closely resembled that of insulin. Pedro and I soon collaborated in a successful search for the nerve growth factor receptor. Only then did I marshal the courage to extend this approach from proteins such as insulin and nerve growth factor to much smaller molecules such as opiates. Candace Pert, a gradate student in my laboratory, was eager to take on a new research project. We obtained a radioactive drug and montored its binding to brain membranes using Pedro’s magic fi lter machine. The very fi rst experiment, which took only about two hours, was successful. Within a few months, we were able to characterize many features of opiate receptors. Knowing the exact sites where receptors are concentrated in the brain explained all the major actions of opiates, such as euphoria, pain relief, depression of breathing, and pupillary constriction. The properties of opiate receptors resembled very much what one would expect for neurotransmitters. Accordingly, we used similar approaches to search for receptors for neurotransmitters in the brain, and within a few years had identifi ed receptors for most of them",

These fi ndings raised an obvious question: Why do opate receptors exist? Humans were not born with morphine in them. Might the opiate receptor be a receptor for a new transmitter that regulates pain perception and emotional states? We and other groups attempted to isolate the hypotesized, normally occurring, morphine-like neurotransmitters. John Hughes and Hans Kosterlitz in Aberdeen, Scotland, were the fi rst to succeed. They isolated and obtained the chemical structures of the fi rst “endorphins,” which are called the enkephalins . In our own laboratory, Rabi Simantov and I obtained the structure of the enkephalins soon after the pulished success of the Scottish group. From the fi rst experiments identifying opiate receptors until the isolation of the enkephalins, only three years elapsed—an interval of frantic, exhilarating work that changed profoundly how we think about drugs and the brain. P A T H O F D I S C O V E R Y BOX 6.1 Finding Opiate Receptors Ligand-binding methods have been enormously important for mapping the anatomical distribution of different neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. Molecular Analysis. There has been an explosion of information about neurotransmitter receptors in recent decades, thanks to modern methods 153 CHAPTER 6 NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS for studying protein molecules. Information obtained with these methods has enabled us to divide the neurotransmitter receptor proteins into two groups: transmitter-gated ion channels and G-protein-coupled (metabtropic) receptors (see Chapter 5). Molecular neurobiologists have determined the structure of the polpeptides that make up many proteins, and these studies have led to some startling conclusions",

Receptor subtype diversity was expected from the actions of different drugs, but the breadth of the diversity was not apreciated until researchers determined how many different polypeptides could serve as subunits of functional receptors. Consider as an example the GABA A receptor, a transmitter-gated chloride channel. Each channel requires fi ve subunits (similar to the ACh-gated ion channel, Figure 5.14), and there are fi ve major classes of subunit proteins, designated , , , , and . At least six different polypeptides (designated 1–6) can substitute for one another as an subunit. Four different polypeptides (designated 1–4) can substitute as a subunit, and four different polypeptides ( 1–4) can be used as a suunit. Although this is not the complete tally, let’s make an interesting caculation. If it takes fi ve subunits to form a GABA A receptor-gated channel and there are 15 possible subunits to choose from, then there are 151,887 possible combinations and arrangements of subunits. This means there are at least 151,887 potential subtypes of GABA A receptors! It is important to recognize that the vast majority of the possible suunit combinations are never manufactured by neurons, and even if they were, they would not work properly. Nonetheless, it is clear that receptor classifi cations like those appearing in Table 6.1, while still useful, serously underestimate the diversity of receptor subtypes in the brain. NEUROTRANSMITTER CHEMISTRY Research using methods such as those discussed previously has led to the conclusion that the major neurotransmitters are amino acids, amines, and peptides.

For the most part, they are similar or identical to the basic chemicals of life, the same substances that cells in all species, from bacteria to giraffes, use for metabolism. Amino acids, the building blocks of protein, are essential to life. Most of the known neurotransmitter molecules are either (1) amino acids, (2) amines derived from amino acids, or (3) peptides constructed from amino acids. ACh is one exception, but it is derived from acetyl CoA, a ubiquitous product of cellular respiration in mitochondria, and choline, which is important for fat metabolism throughout the body. Amino acid and amine transmitters are generally each stored in and released by different sets of neurons. The convention established by Dale classifi es neurons into mutually exclusive groups by neurotransmitter (cholinergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and so on). The idea that a neuron has only one neurotransmitter is often called Dale’s principle . Many peptide-containing neurons violate Dale’s principle because these cells usually release more than one neurotransmitter: an amino acid or amine and a peptide. When two or more transmitters are released from one nerve terminal, they are called co-transmitters . Many examples of neurons with co-transmitters have been identifi ed in recent years, including some that release two small transmitters (e.g., GABA and glcine). Nonetheless, most neurons seem to release only a single amino acid N E U R O T R A N SM I T TE R C HE M IS T R Y 154 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS or amine neurotransmitter, which can be used to assign them to distinct, nonoverlapping classes.

Cholinergic Neurons Acetylcholine (ACh) is the neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction and is therefore synthesized by all the motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem. Other cholinergic cells contribute to the funtions of specifi c circuits in the PNS and CNS, as we will see in Chapter 15. ACh synthesis requires a specifi c enzyme, choline acetyltransferase ( ChAT ) (Figure 6.10). Like nearly all presynaptic proteins, ChAT is manufactured in the soma and transported to the axon terminal. Only cholinergic neurons contain ChAT, so this enzyme is a good marker for cells that use ACh as a neurotransmitter. Immunohistochemistry with ChAT-specifi c antibodies, for example, can be used to identify cholinergic neurons. ChAT synthesizes ACh in the cytosol of the axon terminal, and the neurotransmitter is concentrated in synaptic vesicles by the actions of a vesicular ACh transporter (Box 6.2). ChAT transfers an acetyl group from acetyl CoA to choline (Figure 6.11a). The source of choline is the extracellular fl uid, where BOX 6.2 Pumping Ions and Transmitters N eurotransmitters may lead an exciting life, but the most mundane part would seem to be the steps that recycle them back from the synaptic cleft and eventually into a vesicle. Where synapses are concerned, the exotic proteins of excytosis and the innumerable transmitter receptors get most of the publicity. Yet, the neurotransmitter transporters are very interesting for at least two reasons: They succeed at an extraordinarily diffi cult job, and they are the molecular site at which many important psychoactive drugs act. The hard job of transporters is to pump transmitter moecules across membranes so effectively that they become highly concentrated in very small places. There are two geeral types of neurotransmitter transporters. One type, the neuronal membrane transporter, shuttles transmitter from the extracellular fl uid, including the synaptic cleft, and cocentrates it up to 10,000 times higher within the cytosol of the presynaptic terminal",

Inside cholinergic vesicles, for example, ACh may reach the increible concentration of 1000 mM, or 1 molar—in other words, about twice the concentration of salt in seawater! How do transporters achieve such dramatic feats of cocentration? Concentrating a chemical is like carrying a weight uphill; both are extremely unlikely to occur unless energy is applied to the task. Recall from Chapter 3 that ion pumps in the plasma membrane use ATP as their source of energy to transport Na , K , and Ca 2 against their concentration B R A I N F O O D gradients. These ion gradients are essential for setting the resting potential and for powering the ionic currents that uderlie action and synaptic potentials. Similarly, membranes of synaptic vesicles have pumps that use ATP to fuel the transport of H into vesicles. Notice that once ionic gradents are established across a membrane, they can theselves be tapped as sources of energy. Just as the energy spent in pulling up the weights on a cuckoo clock can be reclaimed to turn the gears and hands of the clock (as the weights slowly fall down again), transporters use transmebrane gradients of Na or H as an energy source for moving transmitter molecules up steep concentration gradients. The transporter lets one transmembrane gradient, that of Na or H , run down a bit in order to build up another gradient, that of the transmitter. The transporters themselves are large proteins that span membranes. There can be several transporters for one tranmitter (e.g., at least four subtypes are known for GABA). Figure A shows how they work. Plasma membrane tranporters use a cotransport mechanism, carrying two Na ions along with one transmitter molecule. By contrast, vesicular membrane transporters use a countertransport mechanism that trades a transmitter molecule from the cytosol for a H from inside the vesicle",

By altering the normal recycling process of various transmitters, the drugs lead to chemical imbalances in the brain that can have prfound effects on mood and behavior. It is also possible that defects in transporters can lead to psychiatric or neurological disease; certainly, some of the drugs that are therapeutcally useful in psychiatry work by blocking transporters. The numerous links between transmitters, drugs, disease, and treatment are tantalizing but complex, and will be discussed further in Chapters 15 and 22.

For certain diseases in which a defi cit in cholinergic synaptic transmission has been noted, dietary supplements of choline are sometimes prescribed to boost ACh levels in the brain. Cholinergic neurons also manufacture the ACh degradative enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) . AChE is secreted into the synaptic cleft and is associated with cholinergic axon terminal membranes. However, AChE is also manufactured by some noncholinergic neurons, so this enzyme is not as useful a marker for cholinergic synapses as ChAT. AChE degrades ACh into choline and acetic acid (Figure 6.11b). This happens very quickly because AChE has one of the fastest catalytic rates among all known enzymes. Much of the resulting choline is taken up by the cholinergic axon terminal via a choline transporter and reused for ACh synthesis (see the red arrow in Figure 6.10). In Chapter 5, we mentioned that AChE is the target of many nerve gases and insecticides. Inhibition of AChE prevents the breakdown of ACh, disrupting transmision at cholinergic synapses on skeletal muscle and heart muscle. Acute effects include marked decreases in heart rate and blood pressure; hoever, death from the irreversible inhibition of AChE typically results from respiratory paralysis. Catecholaminergic Neurons The amino acid tyrosine is the precursor for three different amine nerotransmitters that contain a chemical structure called a catechol (Figure 6.12a). These neurotransmitters are collectively called catechoamines . The catecholamine neurotransmitters are dopamine (DA) , norepinephrine (NE) , and epinephrine , also called adrenaline (Figure 6.12b).

All catecholaminergic neurons contain the enzyme tyrosine hydroxlase (TH) , which catalyzes the fi rst step in catecholamine synthesis, the conversion of tyrosine to a compound called dopa ( L -dihydroxyphenyalanine) (Figure 6.13a). The activity of TH is rate limiting for catechoamine synthesis. The enzyme’s activity is regulated by various signals in the cytosol of the axon terminal. For example, decreased catecholamine release by the axon terminal causes the catecholamine concentration in the cytosol to rise, thereby inhibiting TH. This type of regulation is called end-product inhibition. On the other hand, during periods when catechoamines are released at a high rate, the elevation in [Ca 2 ] i that accopanies neurotransmitter release triggers an increase in the activity of TH, so transmitter supply keeps up with demand. In addition, prolonged periods of stimulation actually cause the synthesis of more mRNA that codes for the enzyme. Dopa is converted into the neurotransmitter DA by the enzyme dopa decarboxylase (Figure 6.13b). Dopa decarboxylase is abundant in ▲ FIGURE 6.13 The synthesis of catecholamines from tyrosine.

In the movement disorder known as Parkinson’s disease, dopaminergic neurons in the brain slowly degenerate and eventually die. One strategy for treating Parkinson’s disease is the administration of dopa, which causes an increase in DA synthesis in the surviving neurons, increasing the amount of DA avaiable for release. (We will learn more about dopamine and movement in Chapter 14.) Neurons that use NE as a neurotransmitter contain, in addition to TH and dopa decarboxylase, the enzyme dopamine -hydroxylase (DBH) , which converts DA to NE (Figure 6.13c). Interestingly, DBH is not found in the cytosol but instead is located within the synaptic vesicles. Thus, in noradrenergic axon terminals, DA is transported from the cytosol to the synaptic vesicles, and there it is made into NE. The last in the line of catecholamine neurotransmitters is epineprine (adrenaline). Adrenergic neurons contain the enzyme phentoamine N -methyltransferase (PNMT) , which converts NE to epinephrine (Figure 6.13d). Curiously, PNMT is in the cytosol of adrenergic axon teminals. Thus, NE must fi rst be synthesized in the vesicles and released into the cytosol for conversion into epinephrine, and then the epinephrine must again be transported into vesicles for release. In addition to serving as a neurotransmitter in the brain, epinephrine acts as a hormone when it is released by the adrenal gland into the bloodstream",

As we shall see in Chapter 15, circulating epinephrine acts at receptors throughout the body to produce a coordinated visceral response. The catecholamine systems have no fast extracellular degradative enzyme analogous to AChE. Instead, the actions of catecholamines in the synaptic cleft are terminated by selective uptake of the neurotransmitters back into the axon terminal via Na -dependent transporters. This step is sensitive to a number of different drugs. For example, amphetamine and cocaine block catecholamine uptake and therefore prolong the actions of the neurotransmitter in the cleft. Once inside the axon terminal, the caecholamines may be reloaded into synaptic vesicles for reuse, or they may be enzymatically destroyed by the action of monoamine oxidase (MAO) , an enzyme found on the outer membrane of mitochondria. Serotonergic Neurons The amine neurotransmitter serotonin , also called 5-hydroxytryptmine and abbreviated 5-HT , is derived from the amino acid tryptophan. Serotonergic neurons are relatively few in number, but, as we shall see in Part III, they appear to play an important role in the brain systems that regulate mood, emotional behavior, and sleep. The synthesis of serotonin occurs in two steps, just like the synthesis of DA (Figure 6.14). Tryptophan is converted fi rst into an intermediary called 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxlase . The 5-HTP is then converted to 5-HT by the enzyme 5-HTP decaboxylase . Serotonin synthesis appears to be limited by the availability of tryptophan in the extracellular fl uid bathing neurons.

The process of sertonin reuptake, like catecholamine reuptake, is sensitive to a number of different drugs. For example, numerous clinically useful antidepressant 159 CHAPTER 6 NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS and antianxiety drugs, including fl uoxetine (trade name Prozac), are slective inhibitors of serotonin reuptake. Once it is back in the cytosol of the serotonergic axon terminal, the transmitter is either reloaded into synaptic vesicles or degraded by MAO. Amino Acidergic Neurons The amino acids glutamate (Glu) , glycine (Gly) , and gamma-aminbutyric acid (GABA) serve as neurotransmitters at most CNS synapses (Figure 6.15). Of these, only GABA is unique to those neurons that use it as a neurotransmitter; the others are among the 20 amino acids that make up proteins. Glutamate and glycine are synthesized from glucose and other precusors by the action of enzymes that exist in all cells. Differences among neurons in the synthesis of these amino acids are therefore quantitative rather than qualitative. For example, the average glutamate concentrtion in the cytosol of glutamatergic axon terminals has been estimated to be about 20 mM, two or three times higher than that in nonglutamatergic cells. The more important distinction between glutamatergic and nongltamatergic neurons, however, is the transporter that loads the synaptic vesicles. In glutamatergic axon terminals, but not in other types, glutmate transporters concentrate glutamate until it reaches a value of about 50 mM in the synaptic vesicles. Because GABA is not one of the 20 amino acids used to construct proteins, it is synthesized in large quantities only by the neurons that use it as a neurotransmitter",

    "chunk_text": ". One of the most common is adenosine triphosphate (ATP) , a key molecule in cellular metablism (see Figure 2.13). ATP is also a neurotransmitter. It is concentrated in all synaptic vesicles in the CNS and PNS, and it is released into the cleft by presynaptic spikes in a Ca 2 -dependent manner, just as the clasic transmitters are. ATP is often packaged in vesicles along with another classic transmitter. For example, catecholamine-containing vesicles may have 100 mM of ATP, an enormous quantity, in addition to 400 mM of the catecholamine itself. In this case, the catecholamine and ATP are co-transmitters. ATP also occurs as a co-transmitter with GABA, glutmate, ACh, DA, and peptide transmitters in various specialized types of neurons. ATP directly excites some neurons by gating cation channels. In this sense, some of the neurotransmitter functions of ATP are similar to those of glutamate and ACh. ATP binds to purinergic receptors , some of which are transmitter-gated ion channels. There is also a large class of G-protein-coupled purinergic receptors. Following its release from syapses, ATP is degraded by extracellular enzymes, yielding adenosine. Adenosine itself does not meet the standard defi nition of a neurotranmitter because it is not packaged in vesicles, but it does activate several adenosine-selective receptors. The most interesting discovery about neurotransmitters in the past few years is that small lipid molecules, called endocannabinoids ( endogenous cannabinoids), can be released from postsynaptic neurons and act on presynaptic terminals (Box 6.3). Communication in this direction, from “post” to “pre,” is called retrograde signaling ; thus, endocannabinoids are retrograde messengers . Retrograde messengers serve as a kind of feeback system to regulate the conventional forms of synaptic transmission, which of course go from “pre” to “post.” The details about endocannabnoid signaling are still emerging, but one basic mechanism is now clear (Figure 6.17)",

Vigorous fi ring of action potentials in the postsynaptic neron causes voltage-gated calcium channels to open, Ca 2 enters the cell in large quantities, and intracellular [Ca 2 ] rises. The elevated [Ca 2 ] then stimulates the synthesis of endocannabinoid molecules from membrane lipids by somehow activating endocannabinoid-synthesizing enzymes. There are several unusual qualities about endocannabinoids: 1. They are not packaged in vesicles like most other neurotransmitters; instead, they are manufactured rapidly and on demand. 2. They are small and membrane permeable; once synthesized, they can diffuse rapidly across the membrane of their cell of origin to contact neighboring cells. 3. They bind selectively to the CB1 type of cannabinoid receptor, which is mainly located on certain presynaptic terminals. CB1 receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors, and their main effect is often to reduce the opening of presynaptic calcium channels. With its cacium channels inhibited, the ability of the presynaptic terminal to release its neurotransmitter (usually GABA or glutamate) is impaired. Thus, when a postsynaptic neuron is very active, it releases endocannabinoids, 161 CHAPTER 6 NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS O F S P E C I A L I N T E R E S T BOX 6.3 This Is Your Brain on Endocannabinoids M ost neurotransmitters were discovered long before their receptors, but modern techniques have tended to reverse this tradition. In this story, the receptors were discovered before their transmitters. Cannabis sativa is the botanical name for hemp, a fi brous plant used through the ages for making rope and cloth. These days, cannabis is much more popular as dope than rope. It is widely, and usually illegally, sold as marijuana or hasish, although medical uses of cannabis-related compounds are slowly being recognized, and medical or recreational use is being legalized in some states and other parts of the world",

    "chunk_text": ". The Chinese fi rst recognized the potent psychoactive properties of cannabis 4000 years ago, but Western society learned of its intoxicating properties only in the nineteenth century, when Napoleon III’s troops returned to France with Egyptian hashish. As a member of Napoleon’s Commission of Sciences and Arts reported in 1810, “For the Egyptians, hemp is the plant par excellence, not for the uses they make of it in Europe and many other countries, but for its peculiar effects. The hemp cultivated in Egypt is indeed intoxicating and narcotic” (cited in Piomelli, 2003, p. 873). At low doses, the effects of cannabis can be euphoria, feelings of calm and relaxation, altered sensations, reduced pain, increased laughter, talkativeness, hunger, and lighheadedness, as well as decreased problem-solving ability, short-term memory, and psychomotor performance (i.e., the skills necessary for driving). High doses of cannabis can cause profound personality changes and even halucinations. In recent years, forms of cannabis have been approved for limited medicinal use in the United States, primarily to treat nausea and vomiting in cancer patients udergoing chemotherapy and to stimulate appetite in some AIDS patients. The active ingredient in cannabis is an oily chemical called 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol , or THC . During the late 1980s, it became apparent that THC can bind to specifi c G-proteicoupled “cannabinoid” receptors in the brain, particularly in motor control areas, the cerebral cortex, and pain pathways. At about the same time, a group at the National Institute of Mental Health cloned the gene for an unknown (or “orphan”) G-protein-coupled receptor. Further work showed that the mystery receptor was a cannabinoid (CB) receptor. Two types of cannabinoid receptors are known: CB1 receptors are in the brain, and CB2 receptors are mainly in immune tisues elsewhere in the body. Remarkably, the brain has more CB1 receptors than any other G-protein-coupled receptor",

We are quite certain they did not evolve to bind the THC from hemp. The natural ligand for a receptor is never the synthetic drug, plant toxin, or snake venom that might have helped us identify that receptor in the fi rst place. It is much more likely that the cannabinoid receptors exist to bind some signaling molecule made naturally by the brain: THC-like neurotransmitters called endocannabinoids . Research has identifi ed two major endocannabinoids: anandamide (from ananda , the Sanskrit word for “internal bliss”) and arachidooylglycerol (2-AG). Anandamide and 2-AG are both small lipid molecules (Figure A), quite different from any other known neurotransmitter. As the search for new transmitters continues, the hunt is also on for more selective compounds that bind to the CB receptors. Cannabinoids are potentially useful for relieving nausea, suppressing pain, relaxing muscles, treating sezures, and decreasing the intraocular pressure of glaucoma. Antagonists of CB1 receptors have recently been tested as appetite suppressants, but they cause unfortunate side effects. Cannabinoid therapies might be more practical if new drugs can be developed that retain the therapeutic benefi ts without causing psychoactive and other side effects.

The gases carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfi de (H 2 S) have also been suggested to be messengers in the brain, although evidence for “gasotransmitter” functions is still sparse. These are the same NO, cabon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfi de that are often major air pollutants. NO is synthesized from the amino acid arginine by many cells of the body and has powerful biological effects, particularly in the regulation of blood fl ow. In the nervous system, NO may be another example of a retrograde messenger. Because NO is small and membrane permeable, similar to endocannabinoids, it can diffuse much more freely than most other tranmitter molecules, even penetrating through one cell to affect another byond it. Its infl uence may spread throughout a small region of local tissue, rather than being confi ned to the site of the cells that released it. On the other hand, NO is evanescent and breaks down very rapidly. The functions of gaseous transmitters are being extensively studied and hotly debated.

(One consequence in males is penile erection.) The cells with the highest levels of ACh are not in the brain but in the cornea of the eye, where there are no ACh rceptors. Likewise, the highest serotonin levels are not in neurons but in blood platelets. These observations underscore the importance of rigorous analysis before a chemical is assigned a neurotransmitter role. The operation of a neurotransmitter system is like a play with two acts. Act I is presynaptic and culminates in the transient elevation of neurotransmitter concentration in the synaptic cleft. We are now ready to move on to Act II, the generation of electrical and biochemical signals in the postsynaptic neuron. The main players are transmitter-gated chanels and G-protein-coupled receptors. TRANSMITTER-GATED CHANNELS In Chapter 5, we learned that ACh and the amino acid neurotransmitters mediate fast synaptic transmission by acting on transmitter-gated ion channels. These channels are magnifi cent minuscule machines. A single channel can be a sensitive detector of chemicals and voltage, it can reglate the fl ow of surprisingly large currents with great precision, it can sift and select between very similar ions, and it can be regulated by other receptor systems. Yet each channel is only about 11 nm long, just barely visible with the best computer-enhanced electron microscopic methods. The Basic Structure of Transmitter-Gated Channels The most thoroughly studied transmitter-gated ion channel is the nictinic ACh receptor at the neuromuscular junction in skeletal muscle. It is a pentamer, an amalgam of fi ve protein subunits arranged like the staves of a barrel to form a single pore through the membrane (Figure 6.18a).

A complete mature channel is made from two subunits, and one each of , , and (abbreviated 2 ). There is one ACh binding site on each of the subunits; the simultneous binding of ACh to both sites is required for the channel to open (Figure 6.18b). The nicotinic ACh receptor on neurons is also a pentamer, but, unlike the muscle receptor, most of these receptors are composed of and subunits only (in a ratio of 3 2 ). Although each type of receptor subunit has a different primary struture, there are stretches where the different polypeptide chains have a similar sequence of amino acids. For example, each subunit polypetide has four separate segments that will coil into alpha helices (see Figure 6.18a). Because the amino acid residues of these segments are hdrophobic, the four alpha helices are believed to be where the polypeptide is threaded back and forth across the membrane, similar to the pore loops of potassium and sodium channels (see Chapters 3 and 4). The primary structures of the subunits of other transmitter-gated channels in the brain are also known, and there are obvious similarities T R A N S M I T T E G A TE D C HA N N E L S 164 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS (Figure 6.19).

Glutamate receptors are tetramers, having four subunits that comprise a functional channel. The M2 region of the gltamate subunits does not span the membrane but instead forms a hairpin that both enters and exits from the inside of the membrane (Figure 6.19c)",

The structure of the glutamate receptors resembles that of some potasium channels (see Figure 3.17), and this has inspired the surprising hpothesis that glutamate receptors and potassium channels evolved from a common ancestral ion channel. The purinergic (ATP) receptors also have an unusual structure. Each subunit has only two membrane-spanning segments, and three subunits make up a complete receptor. The most interesting variations among channel structures are the ones that account for their differences. Different transmitter binding sites let one channel respond to Glu while another responds to GABA; certain amino acids around the narrow ion pore allow only Na and K to fl ow through some channels, Ca 2 through others, and only Cl through yet others. Amino Acid-Gated Channels Amino acid-gated channels mediate most of the fast synaptic transmision in the CNS. Let’s take a closer look at their functions because they are central to topics as diverse as sensory systems, memory, and disease.

The net effect of activating them at nomal, negative membrane potentials is to admit an excess of cations into the cell (i.e., more Na enters than K leaves), causing a rapid and large depolarization. Thus, AMPA receptors at CNS synapses mediate exciatory transmission in much the same way as nicotinic receptors mediate synaptic excitation at neuromuscular junctions. AMPA receptors coexist with NMDA receptors at many synapses in the brain, so most glutamate-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) have components contributed by both (Figure 6.20). NMDgated channels also cause excitation of a cell by admitting an excess of Na , but they differ from AMPA receptors in two very important ways: (1) NMDA-gated channels are permeable to Ca 2 , and (2) inward ionic curent through NMDA-gated channels is voltage dependent. We’ll discuss each of these properties in turn. It is hard to overstate the importance of intracellular Ca 2 to cell funtions. We have already seen that Ca 2 can trigger presynaptic neurotranmitter release. Postsynaptically, Ca 2 can also activate many enzymes, regulate the opening of a variety of channels, and affect gene expression; in excessive amounts, Ca 2 can even trigger the death of a cell (Box 6.4). Thus, activation of NMDA receptors can, in principle, cause widespread and lasting changes in the postsynaptic neuron. Indeed, as we will see in Chapter 25, Ca 2 entry through NMDA-gated channels may cause the changes that lead to long-term memory.

One of the fascinating ironies of neuronal life and death is that glutamate, the most essential neurotransmitter in the brain, is also a common killer of neurons. A large percentage of the brain’s synapses release glutamate, which is stored in large quantities. Even the cytosol of nonglutamatergic nerons has a very high glutamate concentration, greater than 3 mM. An ominous observation is that when you apply this same amount of glutamate to the outside of isolated neurons, they die within minutes. Mae West once said, “Too much of a good thing can be wonderful,” but apparently she wasn’t talking about glutamate. The voracious metabolic rate of the brain demands a cotinuous supply of oxygen and glucose. If blood fl ow ceases, as in cardiac arrest, neural activity will stop within seconds, and permanent damage will result within a few minutes. Disease states such as cardiac arrest, stroke, brain trauma, seizures, and oxygen defi ciency can initiate a vicious cycle of excess glutamate release. Whenever neurons cannot geneate enough ATP to keep their ion pumps working hard, mebranes depolarize, and Ca 2 leaks into cells. The entry of Ca 2 triggers the synaptic release of glutamate. Glutamate further depolarizes neurons, which further raises intracellular Ca 2 and causes still more glutamate to be released. At this point, there may even be a reversal of the glutamate transporter, further contributing to the cellular leakage of glutamate",

    "chunk_text": ". At this point, there may even be a reversal of the glutamate transporter, further contributing to the cellular leakage of glutamate. When glutamate reaches high concentrations, it kills nerons by overexciting them, a process called excitotoxicity . Glutamate simply activates its several types of receptors, which allow excessive amounts of Na , K , and Ca 2 to fl ow across the membrane. The NMDA subtype of the glutamatgated channel is a critical player in excitotoxicity because it is the main route for Ca 2 entry. Neuron damage or death occurs because of swelling resulting from water uptake and stimultion by Ca 2 of intracellular enzymes that degrade proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Neurons literally digest themselves. Excitotoxicity has been implicated in several progressive neurodegenerative human diseases such as amyotrophic laeral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig disease), in which spinal motor neurons slowly die, and Alzheimer’s diease , in which brain neurons slowly die. The effects of various environmental toxins mimic aspects of these diseases. Eating large quantities of a certain type of chickpea can cause latyrism, a degeneration of motor neurons. The pea contains an excitotoxin called -oxalylaminoalanine , which activates glutamate receptors. A toxin called domoic acid , found in contaminated shellfi sh, is also a glutamate receptor agonist. Ingesting small amounts of domoic acid causes seizures and brain damage. And another plant excitotoxin, -methylamnoalanine, may cause a hideous condition that combines signs of ALS, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease in individual patients on the island of Guam. As researchers sort out the tangled web of excitotoxins, receptors, enzymes, and neurological disease, new stratgies for treatment emerge. Glutamate receptor antagonists that can obstruct these excitotoxic cascades and minimize neuronal suicide have shown some clinical promise.

When the NMDA-gated channel opens, Ca 2 and Na enter the cell (and K leaves), but the magnitude of this inward ionic current depends on the postsynaptic membrane potential in an unusual way, for an uusual reason. When glutamate binds to the NMDA receptor, the pore opens as usual. However, at normal negative resting membrane potetials, the channel becomes clogged by Mg 2 ions, and this “magnesium block” prevents other ions from passing freely through the NMDA chanel. Mg 2 pops out of the pore only when the membrane is depolarized, which usually follows the activation of AMPA channels at the same and neighboring synapses. Thus, inward ionic current through the NMDA channel is voltage dependent , in addition to being transmitter gated. Both glutamate and depolarization must coincide before the channel will pass current (Figure 6.21). This property has a signifi cant impact on synaptic integration at many locations in the CNS.

Surprisingly, inhibitory GABA A and glycine receptors have a structure very similar to that of excitatory nicotinic ACh receptors, despite the fact that the fi rst two are selective for anions while the last is selective for caions. Each receptor has subunits that bind the transmitter and suunits that do not. Synaptic inhibition must be tightly regulated in the brain. Too much causes a loss of consciousness and coma; too little leads to a seizure. The need to control inhibition may explain why the GABA A receptor has, in addition to its GABA binding site, several other sites where chemicals can dramatically modulate its function. For example, two classes of drugs, bezodiazepines (such as the tranquilizer diazepam, with the trade name Valium) and barbiturates (including phenobarbital and other sedatives and anticonvulsants), each bind to their own distinct site on the outside face of the GABA A channel (Figure 6.22). By themselves, these drugs do very little to the channel. But when GABA is present, benzodiazepines icrease the frequency of channel openings, while barbiturates increase the duration of channel openings. The result in each case is more inhibitory Cl current, stronger inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), and the behavioral consequences of enhanced inhibition. The actions of benzodiazpines and barbiturates are selective for the GABA A receptor, and the drugs have no effect on glycine receptor function. Some of this selectivity can be understood in molecular terms; only receptors with the type of GABA A subunit, in addition to and subunits, respond to benzodiazepines. Another popular drug that strongly enhances the function of the GABA A receptor is ethanol, the form of alcohol imbibed in beverages. Ethanol has complex actions that include effects on NMDA, glycine, nictinic ACh, and serotonin receptors. Its effects on GABA A channels depend on their specifi c structure",

Evidence indicates that particular , , and subunits are necessary for constructing an ethanol-sensitive GABA A receptor, similar to the structure that is benzodiazepine sensitive. This explains why ethanol enhances inhibition in some brain areas but not others. By understanding this molecular and anatomical specifi city, we can begin to appreciate how drugs like ethanol lead to such powerful, and addictive, effects on behavior. These myriad drug effects present an interesting paradox. Surely, the GABA A receptor did not evolve modulatory binding sites just for the benefi t of our modern drugs. The paradox has motivated researchers to search for endogenous ligands, natural chemicals that might bind to bezodiazepine and barbiturate sites and serve as regulators of inhibition. 169 CHAPTER 6 NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS Substantial evidence indicates that natural benzodiazepine-like ligands exist, although identifying them and understanding their functions are proving diffi cult. Other good candidates as natural modulators of GABA A receptors are the neurosteroids , natural metabolites of steroid hormones that are synthesized from cholesterol primarily in the gonads and adrenal glands, but also in glial cells of the brain. Some neurosteroids enhance inhibitory function while others suppress it, and they seem to do both by binding to their own sites on the GABA A receptor (see Figure 6.22), distinct from those of the other drugs we’ve mentioned. The functions of natural neurosteroids are also obscure, but they suggest a means by which brain and body physiology could be regulated in parallel by the same chemicals.

In Chapter 5, we learned that tranmission at these receptors involves three steps: (1) binding of the nerotransmitter to the receptor protein, (2) activation of G-proteins, and (3) activation of effector systems. Let’s focus on each of these steps. The Basic Structure of G-Protein-Coupled Receptors Most G-protein-coupled receptors are simple variations on a common plan, consisting of a single polypeptide containing seven membrane-spanning alpha helices (Figure 6.23). Two of the extracellular loops of the polypetide form the transmitter binding sites. Structural variations in this rgion determine which neurotransmitters, agonists, and antagonists bind to the receptor. Two of the intracellular loops can bind to and activate G-proteins. Structural variations here determine which G-proteins and, consequently, which effector systems are activated in response to tranmitter binding. A very partial list of G-protein-coupled receptors appears in Table 6.2. The human genome has genes coding for about 800 different G-proteicoupled receptors, which are organized into fi ve major families with G - P R O T EI N - C O U P LE D R EC EP T O R S AN D E F F E C T O R S G-protein Membranspanning alpha helix G-protein-coupled receptor Extracellular side Intracellular side Neurotransmitter Neurotransmitter binding site ▲ FIGURE 6.23 The basic structure of a G-protein-coupled receptor.

    "chunk_text": ". It is also important to recall that G-protein-coupled receptors are important in all of the body’s cell types, not just neurons. The Ubiquitous G-Proteins G-proteins are the common link in most signaling pathways that start with a neurotransmitter receptor and end with effector proteins. G-protein is short for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding protein, which is actally a diverse family of about 20 types. There are many more transmitter receptors than G-proteins, so some types of G-proteins can be activated by many receptors. Most G-proteins have the same basic mode of operation (Figure 6.24): 1. Each G-protein has three subunits, termed , , and . In the resting state, a guanosine diphosphate (GDP) molecule is bound to the G suunit, and the whole complex fl oats around on the inner surface of the membrane. 2. If this GDP-bound G-protein bumps into the proper type of receptor and if that receptor has a transmitter molecule bound to it, then the G-protein releases its GDP and exchanges it for a GTP that it picks up from the cytosol. 3. The activated GTP-bound G-protein splits into two parts: the G suunit plus GTP and the G complex. Both can then move on to infl uence various effector proteins. 4. The G subunit is itself an enzyme that eventually breaks down GTP into GDP. Therefore, G eventually terminates its own activity by coverting the bound GTP to GDP. 5. The G and G subunits come back together, allowing the cycle to begin again. The fi rst G-proteins that were discovered had the effect of stimulating effector proteins. Subsequently, it was found that other G-proteins could inhibit these same effectors. Thus, the simplest scheme for subdividing the G-proteins is G S , designating that the G-protein is stimulatory, and G i , designating that the G-protein is inhibitory. G-Protein-Coupled Effector Systems In Chapter 5, we learned that activated G-proteins exert their effects by binding to either of two types of effector proteins: G-protein-gated ion channels and G-protein-activated enzymes",

The Shortcut Pathway. A variety of neurotransmitters use the shorcut pathway, from receptor to G-protein to ion channel. One example is the muscarinic receptors in the heart. These ACh receptors are coupled via G-proteins to particular types of potassium channels, explaining why ACh slows the heart rate (Figure 6.25). In this case, the subunits migrate laterally along the membrane until they bind to the right type of potassium channel and induce it to open. Another example is neurnal GABA B receptors, also coupled by the shortcut pathway to potassium channels.

Although not quite as fast as a transmitter-gated channel, which uses no intermediary between receptor and channel, this is faster than the second messenger cascades we describe next. The shortcut patway is also very localized compared with other effector systems. As the G-protein diffuses within the membrane, it apparently cannot move very far, so only channels nearby can be affected. Because all the action in the shortcut pathway occurs within the membrane, it is sometimes called the membrane-delimited pathway . Second Messenger Cascades. G-proteins can also exert their effects by directly activating certain enzymes. Activation of these enzymes can triger an elaborate series of biochemical reactions, a cascade that often ends in the activation of other “downstream” enzymes that alter neuronal funtion. Between the fi rst enzyme and the last are several second messengers . The whole process that couples the neurotransmitter, via multiple steps, to activation of a downstream enzyme is called a second messenger cascade (Figure 6.26). In Chapter 5, we introduced the cAMP second messenger cascade initated by the activation of the NE receptor (Figure 6.27a). It begins with the receptor activating the stimulatory G-protein, G S , which proceeds to stimulate the membrane-bound enzyme adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP to cAMP. The subsequent rise of cAMP in the cytosol activates a specifi c downstream enzyme called protein kinase A (PKA) . Many biochemical processes are regulated with a push–pull method, one to stimulate them and one to inhibit them, and cAMP production is no exception",

Figure 6.28 shows how the actvation of various G-proteins can stimulate phospholipase C (PLC) , an enzyme that fl oats in the membrane-like adenylyl cyclase. PLC acts on a membrane phospholipid (PIP 2 , or phosphatidylinositol-4, 5- bisphosphate), splitting it to form two molecules that serve as second messengers: diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP 3 ) . DAG, which is lipid-soluble, stays within the plane of the membrane where it activates a downstream enzyme, protein kinase C (PKC) .

As we have said, elevations in cytosolic Ca 2 can trigger widespread and long-lasting effects. One effect is activation of the enzyme calcium-calmodulin-dpendent protein kinase , or CaMK . CaMK is an enzyme implicated in, among other things, the molecular mechanisms of memory, as we’ll see in Chapter 25. Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation. The preceding examples show that key downstream enzymes in many of the second messenger cacades are protein kinases (PKA, PKC, CaMK). As mentioned in Chapter 5, protein kinases transfer phosphate from ATP fl oating in the cytosol to proteins, a reaction called phosphorylation. The addition of phosphate groups to a protein changes its conformation slightly, thereby changing its biological activity. The phosphorylation of ion channels, for example, can strongly infl uence the probability that they will open or close. Consider the consequence of activating the type of NE receptors on cardiac muscle cells. The subsequent rise in cAMP activates PKA, which phosphorylates the cell’s voltage-gated calcium channels, and this enhances their activity. More Ca 2 fl ows, and the heart beats more strongly. By contrast, the stimulation of -adrenergic receptors in many neurons seems to have no effect on calcium channels, but instead causes inhibition of certain potassium channels. Reduced K conductance causes a slight depolarization, increases the length constant, and makes the neuron more excitable (see Chapter 5). If transmitter-stimulated kinases were allowed to phosphorylate witout some method of reversing the process, all proteins would quickly bcome saturated with phosphates, and further regulation would become impossible",

One important advatage is signal amplifi cation : The activation of one G-protein-coupled receptor can lead to the activation of not one, but many, ion channels (Figure 6.30). Signal amplifi cation can occur at several places in the cascade. A single neurotransmitter molecule, bound to one receptor, can actvate perhaps 10–20 G-proteins; each G-protein can activate an adnylyl cyclase, which can make many cAMP molecules that can spread to activate many kinases. Each kinase can then phosphorylate many channels. If all cascade components were tied together in a clump, sinaling would be severely limited.

But this is only part of the story because any single neurotransmitter can have many diferent effects. A molecule of glutamate can bind to any of several kinds of glutamate receptors, and each of these can mediate a different response. The ability of one transmitter to activate more than one subtype of rceptor, and cause more than one type of postsynaptic response, is called divergence . Divergence is the rule among neurotransmitter systems. Every known neurotransmitter can activate multiple receptor subtypes (see Table 6.2), and evidence indicates that the number of known receptors will continue to escalate as the powerful methods of molecular neurobiology are applied to each system. Because of the multiple receptor subtypes, one transmiter can affect different neurons (or even different parts of the same neron) in very different ways",

Multiple transmitters, each activating their own receptor type, can converge to infl uence the same effector system (Figure 6.31b). Convergence in a single cell can occur at the level of the G-protein, the second messeger cascade, or the type of ion channel. Neurons integrate divergent and convergent signaling systems, resulting in a complex map of chemical effects (Figure 6.31c). The wonder is that it ever works; the challenge is to understand how it does. CONCLUDING REMARKS Neurotransmitters are the essential links between neurons, and between neurons and other effector cells, such as muscle cells and glandular cells. But it is important to think of transmitters as one link in a chain of events, inciting chemical changes both fast and slow, divergent and convergent. You can envision the many signaling pathways onto and within a single neuron as a kind of information network. This network is in delicate baance, shifting its effects dynamically as the demands on a neuron vary with changes in the organism’s behavior. The signaling network within a single neuron resembles in some ways the neural networks of the brain itself. It receives a variety of inputs, in the form of transmitters bombarding it at different times and places",

These inputs cause an increased drive through some signal pathways and a decreased drive through others, and the information is recombined to yield a particular output that is more than a simple summation of the iputs. Signals regulate signals, chemical changes can leave lasting traces of their history, drugs can shift the balance of signaling power—and, in a literal sense, the brain and its chemicals are one.

Now we are ready to assemble them into a nervous system that sees, hears, feels, moves, remembers, and dreams. Just as an uderstanding of neuronal structure is necessary for understanding neurnal function, we must understand nervous system structure in order to understand brain function. Neuroanatomy has challenged generations of students—and for good reason: The human brain is extremely complicated. However, our brain is merely a variation on a plan that is common to the brains of all mammals (Figure 7.1)",

The human brain appears complicated because it is distorted as a result of the selective growth of some parts within the confi nes of the skull. But once the basic mammalian plan is understood, these specializtions of the human brain become clear. We begin by introducing the general organization of the mammalian brain and the terms used to describe it. Then we take a look at how the three-dimensional structure of the brain arises during embryological and fetal development. Following the course of development makes it easier to understand how the parts of the adult brain fi t together. Finally, we explore the cerebral neocortex, a structure that is unique to mammals and proportionately the largest in humans. An Illustrated Guide to Human Neuroanatomy follows the chapter as an appendix. The neuroanatomy presented in this chapter provides the canvas on which we will paint the sensory and motor systems in Chapters 8–14. Because you will encounter a lot of new terms, self-quizzes within this chapter provide an opportunity for review. GROSS ORGANIZATION OF THE MAMMALIAN NERVOUS SYSTEM The nervous system of all mammals has two divisions: the central nevous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Here we identify some of the important components of the CNS and the PNS. We also discuss the membranes that surround the brain and the fl uid-fi lled ventricles within the brain. We’ll then explore some new methods of eamining the structure of the brain. But fi rst, we need to review some anatomical terminology. Anatomical References Getting to know your way around the brain is like getting to know your way around a city. To describe your location in the city, you would use points of reference such as north, south, east, and west and up and down. The same is true for the brain, except that the terms—called anatomical references —are different. Consider the nervous system of a rat (Figure 7.2a)",

We begin with the rat because it is a simplifi ed version that has all the general features of mammalian nervous system organization. In the head lies the brain, and the spinal cord runs down inside the backbone toward the tail. The diretion, or anatomical reference, pointing toward the rat’s nose is known as anterior or rostral (from the Latin for “beak”). The direction pointing toward the rat’s tail is posterior or caudal (from the Latin for “tail”). The direction pointing up is known as dorsal (from the Latin for “back”), and the direction pointing down is ventral (from the Latin for “belly”).

The brains have been drawn to appear aproximately the same size; their relative sizes are shown in the inset on the left. 182 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS Thus, the rat spinal cord runs anterior to posterior. The top side of the spinal cord is the dorsal side, and the bottom side is the ventral side. If we look down on the nervous system, we see that it may be divided into two equal halves (Figure 7.2b). The right side of the brain and spinal cord is the mirror image of the left side. This characteristic is known as bilateral symmetry . With just a few exceptions, most structures within the nervous system come in pairs, one on the right side and the other on the left. The invisible line running down the middle of the nervous system is called the midline , and this gives us another way to describe anatomcal references",

    "chunk_text": ". The invisible line running down the middle of the nervous system is called the midline , and this gives us another way to describe anatomcal references. Structures closer to the midline are medial ; structures farther away from the midline are lateral . In other words, the nose is medial to the eyes, the eyes are medial to the ears, and so on. In addtion, two structures that are on the same side are said to be ipsilateral to each other; for example, the right ear is ipsilateral to the right eye. If the structures are on opposite sides of the midline, they are said to be contralateral to each other; the right ear is contralateral to the left ear. To view the internal structure of the brain, it is usually necessary to slice it up. In the language of anatomists, a slice is called a section ; to slice is to section . Although one could imagine an infi nite number of ways we might cut into the brain, the standard approach is to make cuts parallel to one of the three anatomical planes of section. The plane of the section resulting from splitting the brain into equal right and left halves is called the midsagittal plane (Figure 7.3a). Sections parallel to the midsagittal plane are in the sagittal plane . The two other anatomical planes are perpendicular to the sagittal plane and to one another. The horizontal plane is parallel to the ground (Figure 7.3b). A single section in this plane could pass through both the eyes and the ears. Thus, horizontal sections split the brain into dorsal and ventral parts. The coronal plane is perpendicular to the ground and to the sagittal plane (Figure 7.3c). A single section in this plane could pass through both eyes or both ears but not through all four at the same time. Thus, the coronal plane splits the brain into anterior and posterior parts.

The brain lies entirely within the skull. A side view of the rat brain reveals three parts that are common to all mammals: the cerebrum, the cerebelum, and the brain stem (Figure 7.4a). The Cerebrum. The rostral-most and largest part of the brain is the cerebrum . Figure 7.4b shows the rat cerebrum as it appears when viewed from above. Notice that it is clearly split down the middle into two cerebral hemispheres , separated by the deep sagittal fi ssure . In general, the right cerebral hemisphere receives sensations from, and controls movements of, the left side of the body. Similarly, the left cerebral hemisphere is concerned with sensations and movements on the right side of the body. The Cerebellum. Lying behind the cerebrum is the cerebellum (the word is derived from the Latin for “little brain”). While the cerebellum is in fact dwarfed by the large cerebrum, it actually contains as many nerons as both cerebral hemispheres combined. The cerebellum is primarily a movement control center that has extensive connections with the cerbrum and the spinal cord. In contrast to the cerebral hemispheres, the left side of the cerebellum is concerned with movements of the left side of the body, and the right side of the cerebellum is concerned with movements of the right side. The Brain Stem. The remaining part of the brain is the brain stem, best observed in a midsagittal view of the brain (Figure 7.4c)",

    "chunk_text": ". The Brain Stem. The remaining part of the brain is the brain stem, best observed in a midsagittal view of the brain (Figure 7.4c). The brain stem forms the stalk from which the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum sprout. The brain stem is a complex nexus of fi bers and cells that in part serves to relay information from the cerebrum to the spinal cord and ceebellum, and vice versa. However, the brain stem is also the site where vital functions are regulated, such as breathing, consciousness, and the control of body temperature. Indeed, while the brain stem is considered the most primitive part of the mammalian brain, it is also the most iportant to life. One can survive damage to the cerebrum and cerebellum, but damage to the brain stem is usually fatal. The Spinal Cord. The spinal cord is encased in the bony vertebral column and is attached to the brain stem.

A transection of the spinal cord results in anesthesia (lack of feeling) in the skin and paralysis of the muscles in parts of the body caudal to the cut. Paralysis in this case does not mean that the muscles cannot function, but they cannot be controlled by the brain. The spinal cord communicates with the body via the spinal nerves , which are part of the peripheral nervous system (discussed below). Spinal nerves exit the spinal cord through notches between each vertebra of the vertebral column. Each spinal nerve attaches to the spinal cord by means of two branches, the dorsal root and the ventral root (Figure 7.5)",

Recall from Chapter 1 that François Magendie showed that the dorsal root contains axons bringing information into the spinal cord, such as those that signal the accidental entry of a thumbtack into your foot (see Figure 3.1). Charles Bell showed that the ventral root contains axons carying information away from the spinal cord—for example, to the muscles that jerk your foot away in response to the pain of the thumbtack. The Peripheral Nervous System All the parts of the nervous system other than the brain and spinal cord comprise the peripheral nervous system (PNS) . The PNS has two parts: the somatic PNS and the visceral PNS. The Somatic PNS. All the spinal nerves that innervate the skin, the joints, and the muscles that are under voluntary control are part of the somatic PNS . The somatic motor axons, which command muscle contraction, drive from motor neurons in the ventral spinal cord. The cell bodies of the motor neurons lie within the CNS, but their axons are mostly in the PNS. The somatic sensory axons, which innervate and collect information from the skin, muscles, and joints, enter the spinal cord via the dosal roots. The cell bodies of these neurons lie outside the spinal cord in Dorsal roots Dorsal root ganglia Ventral roots Spinal nerves ▲ FIGURE 7.5 The spinal cord. The spinal cord runs inside the vertebral column. Axons enter and exit the spinal cord via the dorsal and ventral roots, respectively. These roots come together to form the spinal nerves that course through the body. 185 CHAPTER 7 THE STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM clusters called dorsal root ganglia . There is a dorsal root ganglion for each spinal nerve (see Figure 7.5). The Visceral PNS. The visceral PNS , also called the involuntary, vegettive, or autonomic nervous system (ANS) , consists of the neurons that innervate the internal organs, blood vessels, and glands",

    "chunk_text": ". The Visceral PNS. The visceral PNS , also called the involuntary, vegettive, or autonomic nervous system (ANS) , consists of the neurons that innervate the internal organs, blood vessels, and glands. Visceral sensory axons bring information about visceral function to the CNS, such as the pressure and oxygen content of the blood in the arteries. Visceral motor fi bers command the contraction and relaxation of muscles that form the walls of the intestines and the blood vessels (called smooth muscles ), the rate of cardiac muscle contraction, and the secretory function of various glands. For example, the visceral PNS controls blood pressure by regulaing the heart rate and the diameter of the blood vessels. We will return to the structure and function of the ANS in Chapter 15. For now, remember that when one speaks of an emotional reaction that is beyond voluntary control—like “butterfl ies in the stomach” or blushing— it usually is mediated by the visceral PNS (the ANS). Afferent and Efferent Axons. Our discussion of the PNS is a good place to introduce two terms that are used to describe axons in the nervous sytem. Derived from the Latin, afferent (“carry to”) and efferent (“carry from”) indicate whether the axons are transporting information toward or away from a particular point. Consider the axons in the PNS relative to a point of reference in the CNS. The somatic or visceral sensory axons bringing information into the CNS are afferents. The axons that emerge from the CNS to innervate the muscles and glands are efferents. The Cranial Nerves In addition to the nerves that arise from the spinal cord and innervate the body, there are 12 pairs of cranial nerves that arise from the brain stem and innervate (mostly) the head. Each cranial nerve has a name and a number associated with it (originally numbered by Galen, about 1800 years ago, from anterior to posterior). Some of the cranial nerves are part of the CNS, others are part of the somatic PNS, and still others are part of the visceral PNS",

Many cranial nerves contain a complex mixture of axons that perform different functions. The cranial nerves and their various functions are summarized in the chapter appendix. The Meninges The CNS, that part of the nervous system encased in the skull and vertbral column, does not come in direct contact with the overlying bone. It is protected by three membranes collectively called the meninges (singular: meninx), from the Greek for “covering.” The three membranes are the dura mater, the arachnoid membrane, and the pia mater (Figure 7.6). The outermost covering is the dura mater , from the Latin words meaing “hard mother,” an accurate description of the dura’s leatherlike cosistency. The dura forms a tough, inelastic bag that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Just under the dura lies the arachnoid membrane (from the Greek for “spider”). This meningeal layer has an appearance and a consistency resembling a spider web. While there normally is no space between the dura and the arachnoid, if the blood vessels passing through the dura are ruptured, blood can collect here and form what is called a subdural hematoma . The buildup of fl uid in this subdural space can disrupt brain function by compressing parts of the CNS. The disorder is treated by drilling a hole in the skull and draining the blood. 186 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS The pia mater , the “gentle mother,” is a thin membrane that adheres closely to the surface of the brain. Along the pia run many blood vessels that ultimately dive into the substance of the underlying brain. The pia is separated from the arachnoid by a fl uid-fi lled space. This subarachnoid space is fi lled with salty clear liquid called cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) . Thus, in a sense, the brain fl oats inside the head in this thin layer of CSF.

The fl uid-fi lled caverns and canals inside the brain constitute the ventricular system . The fl uid that runs in this system is CSF, the same as the fl uid in the subarachnoid space. CSF is produced by a special tissue, called the choroid plexus , in the ventricles of the cerebral hemispheres. CSF fl ows from the paired ventricles of the cerebrum to a series of connected, central cavities at the core of the brain stem (Figure 7.7). CSF exits the ventricular system and enters the subarachnoid space by way of small openings, or apetures, located near where the cerebellum attaches to the brain stem. In the subarachnoid space, CSF is absorbed by the blood vessels at special structures called arachnoid villi . If the normal fl ow of CSF is disrupted, brain damage can result (Box 7.1). We will return to fi ll in some details about the ventricular system in a moment. As we will see, understanding the organization of the ventriclar system holds the key to understanding how the mammalian brain is organized. New Views of the Brain For centuries, anatomists have investigated the internal structure of the brain by removing it from the skull, sectioning it in various planes, staining the sections, and examining the stained sections. Much has been learned by this approach, but there are some limitations. Among these are the challenges of seeing how parts deep in the brain fi t together in Dura mater (a) (b) Subdural space Arachnoid membrane Subarachnoid space Pia mater Artery Brain ▲ FIGURE 7.6 The meninges.

A breakthrough occurred in 2013 when researchers at Stanford University introduced a new method, called CLARITY, which allows visualization of deep structures without sectioning the brain. The trick is to soak the brain in a solution that replaces light-absorbing liids with a water-soluble gel that turns the brain transparent. If such a “ clarifi ed” brain contains neurons that are labeled with fl uorescent molecules, such as green fl uorescent protein ( GFP; see Chapter 2), then appropriate illumination will reveal the location of these cells deep inside the brain (Figure 7.8). O F S P E C I A L I N T E R E S T BOX 7.1 Water on the Brain I f the fl ow of CSF from the choroid plexus through the vetricular system to the subarachnoid space is impaired, the fl uid will back up and cause a swelling of the ventricles. This condition is called hydrocephalus , a term originally meaning “water head.” Occasionally, babies are born with hydrocephalus. However, because the skull is soft and not completely formed, the head will expand in response to the increased intracranial fl uid, sparing the brain from damage. Often this condition goes unnoticed until the size of the head reaches enormous proportions. In adults, hydrocephalus is a much more serious sitation because the skull cannot expand, and intracranial pressure increases as a result. The soft brain tissue is then compressed, impairing function and leading to death if left untreated",

This, to say the least, limits the usefulness of such anatomical methods for diagnosing nerological disorders in living individuals. Thus, it is no exaggeration to say that neuroanatomy was revolutionized by the introduction of several methods that enable one to produce images of the living brain. Here we briefl y introduce them. Imaging the Structure of the Living Brain. Some types of electromagnetic radiation, like X-rays, penetrate the body and are absorbed by various radiopaque tissues. Thus, using X-ray-sensitive fi lm, one can make twdimensional images of the shadows formed by the radiopaque structures within the body. This technique works well for the bones of the skull, but not for the brain. The brain is a complex three-dimensional volume of slight and varying radiopacity, so little information can be gleaned from a single two-dimensional X-ray image",

An ingenious solution, called computed tomography (CT), was dveloped by Godfrey Hounsfi elds and Allan Cormack, who shared the Nobel Prize in 1979. The goal of CT is to generate an image of a slice of brain. (The word tomography is derived from the Greek for “cut.”) To accomplish this, an X-ray source is rotated around the head within the plane of the desired cross section. On the other side of the head, in the trajectory of the X-ray beam, are sensitive electronic sensors of X-irradiation. The information about relative radiopacity obtained with different viewing angles is fed to a computer that executes a mathematical algorithm on the data. The end result is a digital recostruction of the position and amount of radiopaque material within the plane of the slice. CT scans noninvasively revealed, for the fi rst time, the gross organization of gray and white matter, and the position of the ventricles, in the living brain. While still used widely, CT is gradually being replaced by a newer imaging method, called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) . The advatages of MRI are that it yields a much more detailed map of the brain than CT, it does not require X-irradiation, and images of brain slices can be made in any plane desired. MRI uses information about how hydrogen atoms in the brain respond to perturbations of a strong manetic fi eld (Box 7.2). The electromagnetic signals emitted by the atoms are detected by an array of sensors around the head and fed to a poweful computer that constructs a map of the brain. The information from an MRI scan can be used to build a strikingly detailed image of the whole brain.

By compaing the position of the hydrogen atoms in water molecules at discrete time intervals, the diffusion of water in the brain can be measured. Water difuses much more readily alongside axon membranes than across them, and this difference can be used to detect axon bundles that connect diffeent regions of the brain (Figure 7.9). Functional Brain Imaging. CT and MRI are extremely valuable for detecing structural changes in the living brain, such as brain swelling after a head injury and brain tumors. Nonetheless, much of what goes on in the brain—healthy or diseased—is chemical and electrical in nature and not observable by simple inspection of the brain’s anatomy. Amazingly, however, even these secrets are beginning to yield to the newest imaging techniques. ▲ FIGURE 7.9 Diffusion tensor imaging of the human brain.

It has become an important tool in neuroscience because it can be used noninvasively to obtain a detailed picture of the nervous system, particularly the brain. In the most common form of MRI, the hydrogen atoms are quantifi ed—for instance, those located in water or fat in the brain. An important fact of physics is that when a hydrogen atom is put in a magnetic fi eld, its nucleus (which consists of a single proton) can exist in either of two states: a high-energy state or a low-energy state",

    "chunk_text": ". Because hydrogen atoms are abundant in the brain, there are many protons in each state. The key to MRI is making the protons jump from one state to the other. Energy is added to the protons by passing an electromagnetic wave (i.e., a radio signal) through the head while it is positioned between the poles of a large magnet. When the radio signal is set at just the right frequency, the protons in the low-energy state will absorb energy from the signal and hop to the high-energy state. The frequency at which the protons absorb energy is called the resonant frquency (hence the name magnetic resonance). When the radio signal is turned off, some of the protons fall back down to the low-energy state, thereby emitting a radio signal of their own at a particular frequency. This signal can be picked up by a radio receiver. The stronger the signal, the more hydrogen atoms between the poles of the magnet. If we used the procedure discussed earlier, we would simply get a measurement of the total amount of hydrogen in the head. However, it is possible to measure hydrogen amounts at a fi ne spatial scale by taking advantage of the fact that the frequency at which protons emit energy is prportional to the size of the magnetic fi eld. In the MRI mchines used in hospitals, the magnetic fi elds vary from one side of the magnet to the other. This gives a spatial code to the radio waves emitted by the protons: High-frequency signals come from hydrogen atoms near the strong side of the magnet, and low-frequency signals come from the weak side of the magnet. The last step in the MRI process is to orient the gradient of the magnet at many different angles relative to the head and measure the amount of hydrogen. It takes about 15 minutes to make all the measurements for a typical brain scan. A sphisticated computer program is then used to make a single image from the measurements, resulting in a picture of the distribution of hydrogen atoms in the head.

B R A I N F O O D Cerebellum Central sulcus Figure A Figure B 190 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS BOX 7.3 PET and fMRI U ntil recently, “mind reading” has been beyond the reach of science. However, with the introduction of positron emision tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) , it is now possible to observe and measure changes in brain activity associated with the planning and execution of specifi c tasks. PET imaging was developed in the 1970s by two groups of physicists, one at Washington University led by M. M. TePogossian and M. E. Phelps, and a second at UCLA led by Z. H. Cho. The basic procedure is very simple. A radioative solution containing atoms that emit positrons (postively charged electrons) is introduced into the bloodstream. Positrons, emitted wherever the blood goes, interact with electrons to produce photons of electromagnetic radiation. The locations of the positron-emitting atoms are found by dtectors that pick up the photons. One powerful application of PET is the measurement of metabolic activity in the brain. In a technique developed by Louis Sokoloff and his colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health, a positron-emitting isotope of fl uorine or oxygen is attached to 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG). This radioative 2-DG is injected into the bloodstream and travels to the brain. Metabolically active neurons, which normally use glcose, also take up the 2-DG. The 2-DG is phosphorylated by enzymes inside the neuron, and this modifi cation prevents the 2-DG from leaving",

The 2-DG is phosphorylated by enzymes inside the neuron, and this modifi cation prevents the 2-DG from leaving. Thus, the amount of radioactive 2-DG accumulated in a neuron and the number of positron emisions indicate the level of neuronal metabolic activity. In a typical PET application, a person’s head is placed in an apparatus surrounded by detectors (Figure A). Using computer algorithms, the photons (resulting from positron emissions) reaching each of the detectors are recorded. With this information, levels of activity for populations of neurons at B R A I N F O O D various sites in the brain can be calculated. Compiling these measurements produces an image of the brain activity patern. The researcher monitors brain activity while the subject performs a task, such as moving a fi nger or reading aloud. Different tasks “light up” different brain areas. In order to otain a picture of the activity induced by a particular behavioral or thought task, a subtraction technique is used. Even in the absence of any sensory stimulation, the PET image will cotain a great deal of brain activity. To create an image of the brain activity resulting from a specifi c task, such as a person looking at a picture, this background activity is subtracted out (Figure B). Although PET imaging has proven to be a valuable tecnique, it has signifi cant limitations. Because the spatial resoltion is only 5–10 mm 3 , the images show the activity of many thousands of cells. Also, a single PET brain scan may take one to several minutes to obtain. This, along with concerns about radiation exposure, limits the number of scans that can be otained from one person in a reasonable time period. Thus, the work of S. Ogawa at Bell Labs, showing that MRI techniques could be used to measure local changes in blood oxygen leels that result from brain activity, was an important advance",

Ogawa at Bell Labs, showing that MRI techniques could be used to measure local changes in blood oxygen leels that result from brain activity, was an important advance. The fMRI method takes advantage of the fact that oxyhmoglobin (the oxygenated from of hemoglobin in the blood) has a magnetic resonance different from that of deoxyhemglobin (hemoglobin that has donated its oxygen). More ative regions of the brain receive more blood, and this blood donates more of its oxygen. Functional MRI detects the loctions of increased neural activity by measuring the ratio of oxyhemoglobin to deoxyhemoglobin. It has emerged as the method of choice for functional brain imaging because the scans can be made rapidly (50 msec), they have good spatial resolution (3 mm 3 ), and they are completely noninvasive. The two “functional imaging” techniques now in widespread use are positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) . While the technical details differ, both methods detect changes in regional blood fl ow and metabolism within the brain (Box 7.3). The basic principle is simple. Neurons that are active demand more glcose and oxygen. The brain vasculature responds to neural activity by directing more blood to the active regions. Thus, by detecting changes in blood fl ow, PET and fMRI reveal the regions of brain that are most active under different circumstances. The advent of imaging techniques has offered neuroscientists the etraordinary opportunity of peering into the living, thinking brain. As you can imagine, however, even the most sophisticated brain images are usless unless you know what you are looking at.

Formation of the Neural Tube The embryo begins as a fl at disk with three distinct layers of cells called endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. The endoderm ultimately gives rise to the lining of many of the internal organs (viscera). From the mesoderm arise the bones of the skeleton and the muscles. The nervous system and the skin derive entirely from the ectoderm . Our focus is on changes in the part of the ectoderm that give rise to the nervous system: the neural plate . At this early stage (about 17 days from conception in humans), the brain consists only of a fl at sheet of cells (Figure 7.10a). The next event of interest is the formation of a 194 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS groove in the neural plate that runs rostral to caudal, called the neural groove (Figure 7.10b). The walls of the groove are called neural folds , which subsequently move together and fuse dorsally, forming the neral tube (Figure 7.10c). The entire central nervous system develops from the walls of the neural tube . As the neural folds come together, some neural ectoderm is pinched off and comes to lie just lateral to the neural tube. This tissue is called the neural crest (Figure 7.10d). All neurons with cell bodies in the peripheral nervous system derive from the neural crest. The neural crest develops in close association with the underlying msoderm. The mesoderm at this stage in development forms prominent bulges on either side of the neural tube called somites . From these somites, the 33 individual vertebrae of the spinal column and the related skeletal muscles will develop",

The nerves that innervate these skeletal muscles are therefore called somatic motor nerves. The process by which the neural plate becomes the neural tube is called neurulation . Neurulation occurs very early in embryonic O F S P E C I A L I N T E R E S T BOX 7.4 Nutrition and the Neural Tube N eural tube formation is a crucial event in the development of the nervous system. It occurs early—only 3 weeks after conception—when the mother may be unaware she is prenant. Failure of the neural tube to close correctly is a comon birth defect, occurring in approximately 1 out of every 500 live births. A recent discovery of enormous public health importance is that many neural tube defects can be traced to a defi ciency of the vitamin folic acid (or folate ) in the mternal diet during the weeks immediately after conception. It has been estimated that dietary supplementation of folic acid during this period could reduce the incidence of neural tube defects by 90%. Formation of the neural tube is a complex process (Figure A). It depends on a precise sequence of changes in the three-dimensional shape of individual cells as well as on changes in the adhesion of each cell to its neighbors. The timing of neurulation must also be coordinated with simultneous changes in non-neural ectoderm and the mesoderm. At the molecular level, successful neurulation depends on specifi c sequences of gene expression that are controlled, in part, by the position and local chemical environment of the cell. It is not surprising that this process is highly senstive to chemicals, or chemical defi ciencies, in the maternal circulation. The fusion of the neural folds to form the neural tube occurs fi rst in the middle, then anteriorly and posteriorly (Figure B).

A common birth defect is the failure of appropriate closure of the neural tube. Fortunately, recent research suggests that most cases of neural tube defects can be avoided by ensuring proper maternal nutrition during this period (Box 7.4). Three Primary Brain Vesicles The process by which structures become more complex and functioally specialized during development is called differentiation . The fi rst step in the differentiation of the brain is the development, at the rotral end of the neural tube, of three swellings called the primary vesicles (Figure 7.11). The entire brain derives from the three primary vesicles of the neural tube . The rostral-most vesicle is called the prosencephalon . Pro is Greek for “before”; encephalon is derived from the Greek for “brain.” Thus, the proencephalon is also called the forebrain . Behind the prosencephalon lies in anencephaly , a condition characterized by degeneration of the forebrain and skull that is always fatal. Failure of the posterior neural tube to close results in a condition called spina bifi da . In its most severe form, spina bifi da is charaterized by the failure of the posterior spinal cord to form from the neural plate ( bifi da is from the Latin word meaning “cleft in two parts”). Less severe forms are characterized by defects in the meninges and vertebrae overlying the posterior spinal cord. Spina bifi da, while usually not fatal, does require extesive and costly medical care. Folic acid plays an essential role in a number of metbolic pathways, including the biosynthesis of DNA, which naturally must occur during development as cells divide",

Although we do not precisely understand why folic acid dfi ciency increases the incidence of neural tube defects, one can easily imagine how it could alter the complex choreoraphy of neurulation. Its name is derived from the Latin word for “leaf,” refl ecting the fact that folic acid was fi rst isolated from spinach leaves. Besides green leafy vegetables, good dietary sources of folic acid are liver, yeast, eggs, beans, and oranges. Many breakfast cereals are now fortifi ed with folic acid. Nonetheless, the folic acid intake of the average American is only half of what is recommended to prevent birth defects (0.4 mg/day). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that women take mutivitamins containing 0.4 mg of folic acid before planning pregnancy. 22 days Rostral Caudal (a) 23 days Normal Anencephaly Spina bifida (b) Figure B (a) Neural tube closure.

The central structure that remains after the secondary vesicles have sprouted off is called the diencephalon , or “between brain” (Figure 7.12). Thus, the forebrain at this stage consists of the two optic vesicles, the two telencphalic vesicles, and the diencephalon. The optic vesicles grow and invaginate (fold in) to form the optic stalks and the optic cups, which will ultimately become the optic nerves and the two retinas in the adult (Figure 7.13). The important point is that the retina at the back of the eye, and the optic nerve containing the axons that connect the eye to the diencephalon and midbrain, are part of the brain, not the PNS. Differentiation of the Telencephalon and Diencephalon. The telencphalic vesicles together form the telencephalon , or “endbrain,” consising of the two cerebral hemispheres. The telencephalon continues to dvelop in four ways. (1) The telencephalic vesicles grow posteriorly so that they lie over and lateral to the diencephalon (Figure 7.14a). (2) Another pair of vesicles sprout off the ventral surfaces of the cerebral hemispheres, giving rise to the olfactory bulbs and related structures that particpate in the sense of smell (Figure 7.14b).

Notice in Figure 7.15 that the walls of the telencephalic vesicles apear swollen due to the proliferation of neurons. These neurons form two different types of gray matter in the telencephalon: the cerebral cortex and the basal telencephalon . Likewise, the diencephalon diferentiates into two structures: the thalamus and the hypothalamus (Figure 7.15c). The thalamus, nestled deep inside the forebrain, gets its name from the Greek word for “inner chamber.” The neurons of the developing forebrain extend axons to communicate with other parts of the nervous system. These axons bundle together to form three major white matter systems: the cortical white matter, the corpus callosum, and the internal capsule (Figure 7.15d). The cortical white matter contains all the axons that run to and from the neurons in the cerebral cortex. The corpus callosum is continuous with the cortical white matter and forms an axonal bridge that links cortical neurons of the two cerebral hemispheres. The cortical white matter is also contin 198 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS ous with the internal capsule , which links the cortex with the brain stem, particularly the thalamus. Forebrain Structure-Function Relationships. The forebrain is the seat of perceptions, conscious awareness, cognition, and voluntary action. All this depends on extensive interconnections with the sensory and motor neurons of the brain stem and spinal cord. Arguably the most important structure in the forebrain is the cerebral cortex. As we will see later in this chapter, the cortex is the brain struture that has expanded the most over the course of human evolution. Cortical neurons receive sensory information, form perceptions of the ouside world, and command voluntary movements",

Neurons in the olfactory bulbs receive information from cells that sense chemicals in the nose (odors), and relay this information caudally to a part of the cerebral cortex for further analysis. Information from the eyes, ears, and skin is also brought to the cerebral cortex for analysis. However, each of the sensory pathways serving vision, audition (heaing), and somatic sensation relays (i.e., synapses upon neurons) in the thalamus en route to the cortex. Thus, the thalamus is often referred to as the gateway to the cerebral cortex (Figure 7.16). Thalamic neurons send axons to the cortex via the internal capsule. As a general rule, the axons of each internal capsule carry information to the cortex about the contralateral side of the body. Therefore, if a thumbtack entered the right foot, it would be relayed to the left cortex by the left thalamus via axons in the left internal capsule. But how does the right foot know what the left foot is doing? One important way is by communication between the hemispheres via the axons in the corpus callosum. Cortical neurons also send axons through the internal capsule, back to the brain stem. Some cortical axons course all the way to the spinal cord, forming the corticospinal tract. This is one important way cortex can command voluntary movement. Another way is by communicating with neurons in the basal ganglia, a collection of cells in the basal teencephalon. The term basal is used to describe structures deep in the brain, and the basal ganglia lie deep within the cerebrum. The funtions of the basal ganglia are poorly understood, but it is known that damage to these structures disrupts the ability to initiate voluntary movement. Other structures, contributing to other brain functions, are also present in the basal telencephalon. For example, in Chapter 18, we’ll discuss a structure called the amygdala that is involved in fear and emotion",

Although the hypothalamus lies just under the thalamus, functioally it is more closely related to certain telencephalic structures like the amygdala. The hypothalamus performs many primitive functions and therefore has not changed much over the course of mammalian evoltion. “Primitive” does not mean unimportant or uninteresting, however. The hypothalamus controls the visceral (autonomic) nervous system, which regulates bodily functions in response to the needs of the orgaism. For example, when you are faced with a threatening situation, the hypothalamus orchestrates the body’s visceral fi ght-or-fl ight response. Hypothalamic commands to the ANS will lead to (among other things) an increase in the heart rate, increased blood fl ow to the muscles for ecape, and even the standing of your hair on end. Conversely, when you’re relaxing after Sunday brunch, the hypothalamus ensures that the brain is well nourished via commands to the ANS, which will increase peristalsis (movement of material through the gastrointestinal tract) and redirect ▲ FIGURE 7.16 The thalamus: gateway to the cerebral cortex.

The hypothalamus also plays a key role in motivating animals to fi nd food, drink, and sex in response to their needs. Aside from its connections to the ANS, the hypothalamus also directs bodily responses via connections with the pituitary gland located below the diencephalon. This gland communicates with many parts of the body by releasing hormones into the bloodstream.

For example, the corticospinal tract courses through the midbrain en route to the spinal cord. Damage to this tract in the midbrain on one side produces a loss of voluntary control of movement on the opposite side of the body. The tectum differentiates into two structures: the superior colliculus and the inferior colliculus. The superior colliculus receives direct input from the eye, so it is also called the optic tectum . One function of the optic tectum is to control eye movements, which it does via synaptic connetions with the motor neurons that innervate the eye muscles. Some of the axons that supply the eye muscles originate in the midbrain, bundling together to form cranial nerves III and IV. The inferior colliculus also receives sensory information but from the ear instead of the eye. The inferior colliculus serves as an important relay station for auditory information en route to the thalamus. The tegmentum is one of the most colorful regions of the brain because it contains both the substantia nigra (the black substance) and the red nucleus. These two cell groups are involved in the control of voluntary movement. Other cell groups scattered in the midbrain have axons that project widely throughout much of the CNS and function to regulate cosciousness, mood, pleasure, and pain. Differentiation of the Hindbrain The hindbrain differentiates into three important structures: the cerbellum, the pons , and the medulla oblongata —also simply called the medulla . The cerebellum and pons develop from the rostral half of the hindbrain (called the metencephalon ); the medulla develops from the cadal half (called the myelencephalon ).

The resulting fl ap of brain tissue grows into the cerebellum. The ventral wall of the tube differentiates and swells to form the pons (Figure 7.18). Less dramatic changes occur during the differentiation of the caudal half of the hindbrain into the medulla. The ventral and lateral walls of this region swell, leaving the roof covered only with a thin layer of noneuronal ependymal cells (Figure 7.19).

In addition, neurons of the hinbrain contribute to the processing of sensory information, the control of voluntary movement, and regulation of the autonomic nervous system. The cerebellum, the “little brain,” is an important movement control center. It receives massive axonal inputs from the spinal cord and the pons. The spinal cord inputs provide information about the body’s position in space. The inputs from the pons relay information from the cerebral cortex, specifying the goals of intended movements. The cerebellum copares these types of information and calculates the sequences of muscle contractions that are required to achieve the movement goals. Damage to the cerebellum results in uncoordinated and inaccurate movements. Of the descending axons passing through the midbrain, over 90%— about 20 million axons in the human—synapse on neurons in the pons. The pontine cells relay all this information to the cerebellum on the oppsite site. Thus, the pons serves as a massive switchboard connecting the cerebral cortex to the cerebellum. (The word pons is from the Latin word for “bridge.”) The pons bulges out from the ventral surface of the brain stem to accommodate all this circuitry. The axons that do not terminate in the pons continue caudally and enter the medullary pyramids. Most of these axons originate in the crebral cortex and are part of the corticospinal tract. Thus, “pyramidal tract” is often used as a synonym for corticospinal tract. Near where the medulla joins with the spinal cord, each pyramidal tract crosses from one side of the midline to the other.

In addition to the white matter systems passing through, the medulla contains neurons that perform many different sensory and motor funtions. For example, the axons of the auditory nerves, bringing auditory information from the ears, synapse on cells in the cochlear nuclei of the medulla. The cochlear nuclei project axons to a number of different strutures, including the tectum of the midbrain (the inferior colliculus, dicussed above). Damage to the cochlear nuclei leads to deafness. Other sensory functions of the medulla include touch and taste.

Differentiation of the Spinal Cord As shown in Figure 7.21, the transformation of the caudal neural tube into the spinal cord is straightforward compared to the differentiation of the brain.

The postsynaptic neurons in the medulla give rise to axons that decussate and ascend to the thalamus on the contralaeral side. This crossing of axons in the medulla explains why touching the left side of the body is sensed by the right side of the brain. The lateral column contains the axons of the descending corticospinal tract, which also cross from one side to the other in the medulla. These axons innervate the neurons of the intermediate zone and ventral horn and communicate the signals that control voluntary movement. There are at least a half-dozen tracts that run in the columns of each side of the spinal cord. Most are one-way and bring information to or from the brain. Thus, the spinal cord is the major conduit of information from the skin, joints, and muscles to the brain, and vice versa. However, the spinal cord is also much more than that. The neurons of the spinal gray matter begin the analysis of sensory information, play a critical role in coordinating movements, and orchestrate simple refl exes (such as jerking away your foot from a thumbtack). Putting the Pieces Together We have discussed the development of different parts of the CNS: the telecephalon, diencephalon, midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord. Now let’s put all the individual pieces together to make a whole central nervous system.

Ventral and lateral to the lateral ventricles lies the basal telencephalon. The lateral ventricles are continuous with the third ventricle of the dencephalon. Surrounding this ventricle are the thalamus and the hypthalamus. The third ventricle is continuous with the cerebral aqueduct. Dorsal to the aqueduct is the tectum. Ventral to the aqueduct is the mibrain tegmentum. The aqueduct connects with the fourth ventricle that lies at the core of the hindbrain. Dorsal to the fourth ventricle sprouts the cerebellum. Ventral to the fourth ventricle lie the pons and the medulla. You should see by now that fi nding your way around the brain is easy if you can identify which parts of the ventricular system are in the neigborhood (Table 7.3). Even in the complicated human brain, the ventriclar system holds the key to understanding brain structure. Special Features of the Human CNS So far, we’ve explored the basic plan of the CNS as it applies to all mamals. Figure 7.23 compares the brains of the rat and the human.

Let’s start by reviewing the similarities. The dorsal view of both brains reveals the paired hemispheres of the telencephalon (Figure 7.23a). A midsagittal view of the two brains shows the telencephalon extending rostrally from the diencephalon (Figure 7.23b). The diencephalon surounds the third ventricle, the midbrain surrounds the cerebral aqueduct, and the cerebellum, pons, and medulla surround the fourth ventricle. Notice how the pons swells below the cerebellum, and how structurally elaborate the cerebellum is. Now let’s consider some of the structural differences between the rat and human brains. Figure 7.23a reveals a striking one: the many convlutions on the surface of the human cerebrum. The grooves in the surface of the cerebrum are called sulci (singular: sulcus ), and the bumps are called gyri (singular: gyrus ). Remember, the thin sheet of neurons that lies just under the surface of the cerebrum is the cerebral cortex. Sulci and gyri result from the tremendous expansion of the surface area of the cerebral cortex during human fetal development. The adult human cotex, measuring about 1100 cm 2 , must fold and wrinkle to fi t within the confi nes of the skull. This increase in cortical surface area is one of the “distortions” of the human brain. Clinical and experimental evidence idicates that the cortex is the seat of uniquely human reasoning and cogntion. Without cerebral cortex, a person would be blind, deaf, dumb, and unable to initiate voluntary movement. We will take a closer look at the structure of the cerebral cortex in a moment",

Three other lobes (named after skull bones) also describe the parts of human cerebrum. The portion of the cerebrum lying just under the frontal bone of the forehead is called the frontal lobe . The deep central sulcus marks the posterior border of the frontal lobe, caudal to which lies the parietal lobe , under the paretal bone.

It is important to realize that, despite the disproportionate growth of the cerebrum, the human brain still follows the basic mammalian brain plan laid out during embryonic development. Again, the ventricles are key. Although the ventricular system is distorted, particularly by the growth of the temporal lobes, the relationships that relate the brain to the different ventricles still hold (Figure 7.25).

As we will see repeatedly in subsequent chapters, the systems in the brain that govern the processing of senstions, perceptions, voluntary movement, learning, speech, and cognition all converge in this remarkable organ. Types of Cerebral Cortex Cerebral cortex in the brain of all vertebrate animals has several comon features, as shown in Figure 7.26.

Third, at least one cell layer contains pyramidal cells that emit large dendrites, called apical dendrites , that extend up to layer I, where they form multiple branches. Thus, we can say that the cerebral cortex has a characteristic cytoarchitecture that distinguishes it, for example, from the nuclei of the basal telencephalon or the thalamus. Figure 7.27 shows a Nissl-stained coronal section through the caudal telencephalon of a rat brain. You don’t need to be Cajal to see that diferent types of cortex can also be discerned based on cytoarchitecture. Medial to the lateral ventricle is a piece of cortex that is folded onto itself in a peculiar shape. This structure is called the hippocampus , which, despite its bends, has only a single cell layer. (The term is from the Greek word for “seahorse.”) Connected to the hippocampus ventrally and lateally is another type of cortex that has only two cell layers. It is called the olfactory cortex because it is continuous with the olfactory bulb, which sits further anterior. The olfactory cortex is separated by a sulcus, called the rhinal fi ssure , from another more elaborate type of cortex that has many cell layers. This remaining cortex is called neocortex .

What region of brain stem is this, based on the appearance of the fluid-filled space at its core? 210 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS Thus, when we said previously that the cerebral cortex has expanded over the course of human evolution, we really meant that the neocortex has expanded. Similarly, when we said that the thalamus is the gateway to the cortex, we meant that it is the gateway to the neocortex. Most neroscientists are such neocortical chauvinists (ourselves included) that the term cortex , if left unqualifi ed, is usually intended to refer to the cerebral neocortex. In Chapter 8, we will discuss the olfactory cortex in the context of the sense of smell. Further discussion of the hippocampus is reserved until later in this book, when we explore its role in the limbic system (Chapter 18) and in memory and learning (Chapters 24 and 25). The necortex will fi gure prominently in our discussions of vision, audition, smatic sensation, and the control of voluntary movement in Part II, so let’s examine its structure in more detail. Areas of Neocortex Just as cytoarchitecture can be used to distinguish the cerebral cotex from the basal telencephalon, and the neocortex from the olfactory cortex, it can be used to divide the neocortex up into different zones. This is precisely what the famous German neuroanatomist Korbinian Brodmann did at the beginning of the twentieth century. He constructed a cytoarchitectural map of the neocortex (Figure 7.28). In this map, each area of cortex having a common cytoarchitecture is given a number. Thus, we have “area 17” at the tip of the occipital lobe, “area 4” just antrior to the central sulcus in the frontal lobe, and so on. What Brodmann guessed, but could not show, was that cortical areas that look different perform different functions",

For instance, we can say that area 17 is visual cotex, because it receives signals from a nucleus of the thalamus that is connected to the retina at the back of the eye. Indeed, without area 17, a human is blind. Similarly, we can say that area 4 is motor cortex bcause neurons in this area project axons directly to the motor neurons of the ventral horn that command muscles to contract. Notice that the different functions of these two areas are specifi ed by their different connections. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 17 18 19 20 21 22 37 38 41 42 44 45 46 ▲ FIGURE 7.28 Brodmann’s cytoarchitectural map of the human cerebral cortex. 211 CHAPTER 7 THE STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Neocortical Evolution and Structure-Function Relationships. A problem that has fascinated neuroscientists since the time of Brodmann is how the neocortex has changed over the course of mammalian evolution. The brain is a soft tissue, so there is not a fossil record of the cortex of our early mammalian ancestors. Nonetheless, considerable insight can be gained by comparing the cortex of different living species (see Figure 7.1). The surface area of the cortex varies tremendously among species; for example, a comparison of mouse, monkey, and human cortex reveals diferences in size on the order of 1:100:1000. On the other hand, there is little difference in the thickness of the neocortex in different mammals, varying by no more than a factor of two. Thus, we can conclude that the amount of cortex has changed over the course of evolution, but not its basic structure",

The famous Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal, intrduced in Chapter 2, wrote in 1899 that “while there are very remarkable differences of organization of certain cortical areas, these points of diference do not go so far as to make impossible the reduction of the cortcal structure to a general plan.” A challenge that has preoccupied many scientists since then has been to fi gure out exactly what this plan is. As we will discuss in later chapters, modern thinking is that the smallest functional unit of the neocortex is a cylinder of neurons 2 mm high—the distance from the white matter to the cortical surface—and 0.5 mm in diameter. This cylinder, usually described as a neocortical column, cotains on the order of 10,000 neurons and 100 million synapses (approxmately 10,000 synapses per neuron). We wish to understand the detailed wiring diagram of how these neurons connect with one another: the conectome of the neocortex. This is a tall order because synapses can be identifi ed with confi dence only using electron microscopy, which requires very thin ( 50 nm) sections of tissue. To give an idea of the magnitude of the challenge, consider the project that South African Nobel laurate Sidney Brenner and his collaborators conducted in the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill, in North London, England. Brenner was convinced that uderstanding the neural basis of behavior required a circuit diagram, and to tackle this, he chose a simple organism, the 1 mm long fl atworm, Caenorhabditis elegans (usually abbreviated C. elegans )—a far cry from the neocortex, granted, but possibly a tractable problem to solve because the worm has only 302 neurons and about 7000 synapses. Despite this relative simplicity, the “mind of the worm,” as they called their project, took over a dozen years to complete",

Since the publication of this work in 1986, many of the obstacles to reconstructing a synaptic wiring diagram have begun to yield to advances in technology, including automated setioning of brain tissue for electron microscopy and computer-aided recostruction of volumes of tissue from very thin sections (Box 7.5). Although we are not there yet, such advances have spawned optimism that Cajal’s dream might soon be realized and not just for the cortex but for the etire brain. Brodmann proposed that neocortex expanded by the insertion of new areas. Detailed comparisons of cortical structure and function in living species with diverse evolutionary histories suggest that the primordial neocortex of our common mammalian ancestor consisted mainly of three types of cortex. The fi rst type consists of primary sensory areas , which are the fi rst to receive signals from the ascending sensory pathways. For example, area 17 is designated as primary visual cortex, or V1, because it receives input from the eyes via a direct path: retina to thalamus to 212 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS M y career path has been full of zigs and zags.

As the famous research and development arm of the telecommunication company AT&T, Bell Labs had produced Nobel Prize–winning discoveries and seminal iventions like the transistor. During my summer there, I was supposed to theorize about superconductivity. Instead, I met Haim Sompolinsky, who had just arrived from Israel for a sabatical year. Haim had previously developed mathematical models of interacting particles in a magnetic fi eld and was now enthusiastically moving on to interacting neurons. I was hooked by this theory of neural networks, so I followed Haim to Jerusalem for post-doctoral training",

We applied ideas from statistical physics to understand when artifi cial neural networks—that is, networks of computational units modeled loosely after neurons—learn not gradually but suddenly, as if with an “aha!” moment. When not engaged in lengthy matematical calculations, I also learned to speak Hebrew and how to make hummus. After two years in Jerusalem, I returned to Bell Labs. In the organizational chart, all company departments had a fi vdigit number. I belonged to Theoretical Physics, Department 11111. That meant we were the smartest of the smart, right? But Bell Labs was under pressure to be useful—to produce not Nobel Prizes but more revenue for AT&T—and some quipped, “The more 1’s in your department number, the more useless you are.” Still, Bell Labs was like Disneyland for the mind, japacked with researchers working on a dizzying variety of inteesting topics. Many left their offi ce doors open, so you could pop in and ask questions any time. Experimental physicists in the Biological Computation Department were pioneering the use of functional MRI and advanced microscopy to observe neural activity. At the other end of the building were computer scientists working in the fi eld of machine learning—a process by which a computer can “learn” from experience rather than being explicitly programmed. Soon I was inventing algorithms that enabled artifi cial neral networks to learn, and I developed a mathematical theory of a hindbrain neural circuit called the oculomotor integrtor . I continued this work after moving to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an assistant professor. In 2004, I was tenured and promoted to the rank of full professor. I should have been happy, but instead, I felt depressed. My theory of the oculomotor integrator was interesting and even plausible, judging from experimental tests by my collaborator David Tank at Princeton",

But others were continuing to prpose alternative theories, and the fi eld showed no sign of coverging on a consensus. My theory assumed the existence of recurrent connections between integrator neurons. Yet after a decade of study, I didn’t even know for sure whether intgrator neurons were connected to each other at all! When I complained to David, he suggested that I change my research focus. In the 1990s, we had both worked at Bell Labs with Winfried Denk, who had since moved to the Max Planck Institute of Biomedical Research in Heidelberg. There Winfried had built an ingenious automated device that could image the face of a block of brain tissue, and then shave off a thin slice to expose a new face. By repeatedly cutting deeper and deeper into the block, the device could acquire a three-dimensional (3D) image of brain tissue. Because Winfried’s device used an electron microscope, the image was sharp enough to reveal all synapses, as well as all nerons in the tissue. (Recall that Cajal could visualize only a small number of neurons with his light microscope and the P A T H O F D I S C O V E R Y BOX 7.5 Connecting with the Connectome cortex. The second type of neocortex consists of secondary sensory areas , so designated because of their heavy interconnections with the primary sensory areas. The third type of cortex consists of motor areas , which are intimately involved with the control of voluntary movement. These cortical areas receive inputs from thalamic nuclei that relay informtion from the basal telencephalon and the cerebellum, and they send outputs to motor control neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord. For example, because cortical area 4 sends outputs directly to motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, it is designated the primary motor cortex, or M1",

It is believed that the common mammalian ancestor had 213 CHAPTER 7 THE STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Golgi stain, and could not see synapses at all.) In principle, from such an image it would be possible to reconstruct the “wiring diagram” of a piece of brain tissue by tracing the paths of neural branches, the “wires” of the brain, and locaing the synapses. The catch was the huge amount of image data that had to be analyzed. Winfried’s device had the potential to generate a petabyte of data from a cubic millimeter volume, the equivlent of a billion pictures in your digital photo album. Manual reconstruction of the wiring diagram would be prohibitively time-consuming. I decided to work on the problem of speeing up image analysis by computer automation. In 2006, my laboratory began collaborating with Winfried’s laboratory to apply the methods of machine learning to his images. This computational method signifi cantly improved the speed and accuracy of 3D reconstruction of neurons. However, the method still made errors, so it could not completely rplace human intelligence. In 2008, we started creating sofware that would enable humans to work with the machines to reconstruct neural circuits. This eventually turned into the “citizen science” project called EyeWire , which has regitered over 150,000 players from 100 countries since its 2012 launch (http://blog.eyewire.org/about). “EyeWirers” analyze images by playing a game resembling a 3D coloring book. By coloring, they reconstruct the branches of neurons, which are like the “wires” of the brain (Figure A).

The discovery suggests a new solution to a problem that has eluded neuroscientists for 50 years: How does the retina detect moving visual stimuli? Researchers are conducting experiments to test our new theory, and only time will tell whether it’s correct. But it’s already clear that our computtional technologies for reconstructing connectivity are acceerating progress towards understanding how neural circuits function. I'm now at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, where I am continuing to work towards my dream of recostructing a connectome, a wiring diagram of an entire brain. on the order of about 20 different areas that could be assigned to these three categories. Figure 7.29 shows views of the brain of a rat, a cat, and a human, with the primary sensory and motor areas identifi ed. It is plain to see that when we speak of the expansion of the cortex in mammalian evoltion, what has expanded is the region that lies in between these areas. Much of the “in-between” cortex refl ects expansion of the number of seondary sensory areas devoted to the analysis of sensory information. For example, in primates that depend heavily on vision, such as humans, the number of secondary visual areas has been estimated to be between 20 Figure A Seven neurons in a small volume of retina with their dendrites reconstructed from electron micrscopic images.

The emergence of the “mind”—our unique ability to interpret behavior (our own and that of others) in terms of unobservable mental states, such as desires, intentions, and beliefs— correlates best with the expansion of the frontal cortex. Indeed, as we will see in Chapter 18, lesions of the frontal cortex can profoundly alter an individual’s personality. CONCLUDING REMARKS Although we have covered a lot of new ground in this chapter, we have only scratched the surface of neuroanatomy. Clearly, the brain deserves its status as the most complex piece of matter in the universe. What we have presented here is a shell, or scaffold, of the nervous system and some of its contents. Understanding neuroanatomy is necessary for understanding how the brain works. This statement is just as true for an undergraduate fi rstime neuroscience student as it is for a neurologist or a neurosurgeon. In fact, neuroanatomy has taken on a new relevance with the advent of methods of imaging the living brain (Figure 7.30). An Illustrated Guide to Human Neuroanatomy appears as an appedix to this chapter. Use the guide as an atlas to locate various strutures of interest. Labeling exercises are also provided to help you learn the names of the parts of the nervous system you will encounter in this book. In Part II, Sensory and Motor Systems, the anatomy presented in this chapter and its appendix will come alive, as we explore how the brain goes about the tasks of smelling, seeing, hearing, sensing touch, and moving.

    "chunk_text": ". The fi rst is the brain at rest. You might logically think the brain activity of a person daydreaming at the beach would be about as interesting as looking at a blank piece of paper. On the contrary, recent research indicates that in the brain “at rest” a network of areas is busy doing things such as diffusely monitoring our surroundings and procesing daydreams. When we become more active, the brain must deal with the enormous volume of information coming in through our senses. Rather than tring to process all of these signals simultaneously, we selectively focus on things that catch our attention, such as a shark fi n in the water or an object important to us, like a cold drink about to fl y out of our hand. Selective attention, or simply attention , is the ability to focus on one aspect of sensory input. In the visual system, attention enables us to cocentrate on one object over many others in our visual fi eld. Interactions between modalities also occur. For example, if you are performing an attention-demanding visual task, such as reading a book at a coffee shop, you will be less sensitive to the sounds of people talking around you. Amidst all the sights, sounds, and tastes coming into our brain, we are able to preferentially process some information and ignore the rest. We will see that attention has signifi cant effects on perception and that there are corresponding changes in the sensitivity of neurons at many locations in the brain. A brain function related to attention is consciousness. In general use, consciousness means awareness of something (the fake shark fi n in our example). For centuries, philosophers have wrestled with the meaning of consciousness, and more recently, neuroscientists have devised experments to reveal the neural basis of the conscious brain. The link between attention and consciousness appears to be tight, as we are generally aware of what we pay attention to. However, we will see they are actually distinctly different processes",

RESTING STATE BRAIN ACTIVITY If you go into a quiet room, lie down, and close your eyes (but stay awake), what do you suppose your brain is doing? If your answer is “not much,” you are probably in good company. In our discussions of various brain systems, we have described how neurons become active in response to incoming sensory information or the generation of movement. Modern brain imaging techniques are consistent with this view that, in response to behavioral demands, neurons become more active in cortical areas that process ongoing perceptual or motor information. It is reasonable to infer that the brain is quiet in the absence of active processing. However, when the entire brain is imaged with positron emission tomography (PET) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), it is found that its resting state activity includes some regions that really are fairly quiet I NT R O D U C TIO N R E S T I N G S T A TE B RA IN A C TIV IT Y 721 CHAPTER 21 THE RESTING BRAIN, ATTENTION, AND CONSCIOUSNESS and others that are surprisingly active. An important question is what, if anything, does the resting activity signify? The Brain’s Default Mode Network Human imaging studies suggest that the difference between the brain’s resting state and the activity recorded while a person performs a task may teach us important lessons about the nature of the resting brain and the functions that it performs. The existence of resting state activity does not in itself allow us to conclude much. Conceivably, the resting actiity might vary randomly from moment to moment and person to person, and activations associated with behavioral tasks would be superimposed on this random background. However, this does not seem to be the case",

    "chunk_text": ". However, this does not seem to be the case. When a person engages in a perceptual or behavioral task, there are dcreases in the activity of some brain areas at the same time that tasrelevant brain areas become more active. One possibility is that both the decreases and increases in activity are related to the task. For example, if a person is required to perform a diffi cult visual task and ignore irreevant sounds, we might expect the visual cortex to become more active and the auditory cortex less active. Two further observations suggest that there is something fundametal and signifi cant about the resting brain activity. First, the areas that show decreased activity compared to the resting state are consistent when the nature of the task is changed. It appears that the areas shoing decreased activity during behavioral tasks are always active at rest and become less active during any task. Figure 21.1 summarizes data from experiments using nine different tasks involving vision, language, and memory. The blue and green patches in the fi gure show brain areas in which activity decreased from the resting state when humans egaged in any of the nine tasks. The particular task does not seem to account for the activity changes. Second, the patterns in brain actiity changes are consistent across human subjects. These observations suggest that the brain might be “busy” even in the state we call rest, that the resting activities are consistent, and that these activities are decreased when a task is performed. FIGURE 21.1 The default mode network. (a) Data from nine PET imaging studies involving different behavioral tasks were averaged to produce these lateral and medial views of brain activity.

(a) (b) 722 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR Brain areas that show more activity in the resting state than during behavioral tasks include the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, posterior parietal cortex, hippocampus, and lateral temporal cotex. Together these areas are called the default mode network , or dfault network, to indicate that the brain defaults to activity in this group of interconnected areas when it is not engaged in an overt task. Some scientists believe this network of areas defi nes a system or a group of interacting systems in the same sense as we defi ne sensory and motor systems. A fi nding consistent with this idea is the striking degree of corrlation in brain activity between components of the default mode network. Figure 21.1b shows a 5-minute recording made from the two brain areas (medial prefrontal, cingulate cortex) indicated by arrows in Figure 21.1a. The subject was lying in an fMRI machine doing nothing more than fi xaing on a small crosshair on a visual display. For reasons unknown, there were continuous variations in the fMRI signal and there was a remarable degree of correlation between activity in the distant brain areas. Whether these fl uctuations are related to thought is not known, but they suggest coordination or interaction between brain areas. Establishing the function of the default mode network is challenging because the brain areas involved participate in diverse activities. It is tempting to view the resting state activity as an indication of the inner life of the brain. When we relax, it is common to daydream, remember, and imagine, things referred to as spontaneous cognition",

As the default mode network is deactivated during most tasks, it is diffi cult to conduct experiments examining its function. However, we can infer possible funtions of the default network by considering its components and the hanful of tasks that do activate it. For starters, the absence of primary sesory and motor areas is consistent with the idea that the default network is not chiefl y concerned with taking in sensory information or controlling movement. Functions of the Default Network. A variety of hypotheses have been considered for the function of the default network. The two we will cosider here are the sentinel hypothesis and the internal mentation hypotesis . The idea behind the sentinel hypothesis is that even when we rest, we must broadly monitor (pay attention to) our environment; in comparson, when we are active, we focus our attention on the matter at hand. If you imagine our ancient ancestors living in a world harboring constant threats, it makes sense that we may have evolved to be always “on the lookout.” One experiment with results consistent with this idea found that decreases from default network activity are less when a person switches from rest to a peripheral vision task than from rest to a foveal vision task. Perhaps the decrease is less when the active task involves periperal vision because at rest we always diffusely monitor our broad visual fi eld (thus, there is less change from this sentinel activity to an active task involving peripheral vision). Another study reported that the default network became activated in an experiment requiring people to broadly monitor their peripheral visual fi eld for stimuli at random locations but not when they were instructed to focus on one location where a stimulus might appear",

Also relevant to the sentinel hypothesis is a rare disorder known as simultagnosia (a component of Bálint’s syndrome), in which people have normal visual fi elds and are able to perceive individual ojects, but are unable to integrate simultaneous information to understand a complex scene. For example, shown a picture of an animal, a patient said, “There is a round head joining what looks like a powerful body; there are four shortish legs; it doesn’t say anything to me; ah, but there is a 723 CHAPTER 21 THE RESTING BRAIN, ATTENTION, AND CONSCIOUSNESS small and curly tail so I think it must be a pig.” In other words, this peson was not able to put the pieces mentally together and recognized the pig only because of its distinctive tail. Evidence suggests that the poterior cingulate cortex, a part of the default network, may play a role in diffusely monitoring the visual fi eld for stimuli. The speculation is that this brain area, which is part of the default network and is damaged in simultagnosia, is involved in sentinel activities. The internal mentation hypothesis says that the default mode network supports thinking and remembering, the sort of daydreaming we do while sitting quietly. In an experiment that suggests this hypothesis, brain activity is imaged while subjects are asked to silently recall past events in their lives or imagine an event that might happen to them in the future. For example, “recall a past event from last week” or “envisage a future event in the next 5–20 years.” Brain activity in these autobiographical memory tasks is contrasted with activity recorded in control tasks that involve the simple use of facts rather than recall and thinking about atobiographical information. In one control task, subjects construct a setence using a cue word, and in another, they imagine objects bigger and smaller than an object named by a cue word. In the memory tasks, the hippocampus and neocortical areas in the default network become more active; in the control tasks, these brain areas were not activated",

The hpothesis is that the memory tasks activate the brain in a manner similar to daydreaming about one’s life, unlike the structured use of facts in the control tasks. Figure 21.2 shows that recalling past events and imagiing new ones activate similar regions of medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex. Although not all scientists agree with the defi nition of a default mode network, considerable evidence suggests that certain components of the brain are busier while we rest and that they do different things from brain areas that become engaged during active tasks. The overall hypothesis is that, when the situation requires us to become actively involved in a peceptual or motor task, we switch modes from sentinel and internal metation activities (high default network activity) to focused processing of sensory input (low default network activity and increased sensory–motor activity). Studying functions of the resting brain is challenging because typical experimental tasks (“do this,” “look at that”) shut down the areas being studied. One thing that seems clear is that the transition from brain activity in the default network at rest to sensory processing in active tasks involves a change in the focus of attention—our next topic to explore.

Behind you, you hear someone mention your name, and you decide to eavesdrop. Without turning around, you start focusing your attention on this other convesation to fi nd out what’s being said about you. This common experience of fi ltering auditory input, called the cocktail party effect , is an example of attention that we use within and across sensory modalities. Because its behavioral and neural functions have been studied in detail, we will focus on visual attention. Studies of attention often describe it as a limited resource or bottleneck in brain processing. It is common to use the term “selective attention” to emphasize that it is directed to select objects, unlike overall arousal, which is unselective. For brevity, we will use “attention,” but this term should be taken to mean selective attention. The limit that attention puts on brain processing is probably a good thing; one can only imagine how overwhelming sensory input might be if we were to simultaneously focus on every portion of our visual environment, every sound, and every smell. The limited capacity of attention probably explains why traffi c accidents are much more common while people are texting or talking on cell phones. As we will see, attention has signifi cant effects on behavioral speed and precision. While it is not simply a problem of attention, attention-defi cit hyperactivity disorder demonstrates how critical attentional mechanisms are (Box 21.1)",

At times, we all have diffi culty concentrating on our work, sitting still, and resisting the urge to play. But for millions of people, the syndrome that has come to be called attention-defi cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) routinely and seriously inteferes with their ability to get things done. The three traits commonly associated with ADHD are inatention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness. Children normally exhibit these traits more than adults, but if their behaviors are pronounced, ADHD may be diagnosed. Estimates are that 5–10% of all school-age children worldwide have ADHD, and the disorder interferes with their schoolwork and interactions with classmates. Follow-up studies show that many people diagnosed with ADHD continue to exhibit some symptoms as adults. We do not know what causes ADHD, but there are several clues. For example, it has been reported that in MRI scans, several brain structures, including prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia, are smaller in children with ADHD. It is not known whether these differences are behaviorally signifi cant, and they are not reliable enough to be a basis for diagnoing the disorder. However, the possible involvement of these structures is intriguing because they have long been implcated in the regulation and planning of behavior. You might recall Phineas Gage from Box 18.2 in Chapter 18, who eperienced great diffi culty making and carrying out plans after a severe lesion to his prefrontal cortex.

Children of parents with ADHD are more likely to develop it, and a child is much more likely to have it if an identical twin does. Nongenetic factors, such as brain injury and premature birth, may also be involved. Several genes related to the function of dopaminergic neurons have been reported to be abnormal in people with ADHD. These include the D4 dopamine receptor gene, the D2 dopamine receptor gene, and the dopamine transporter gene. We have seen in several previous chapters how important dopaminegic transmission is for a variety of behaviors, so it will be a challenge to clarify dopamine’s involvement in ADHD. At present the most common treatment for ADHD, aside from behavioral therapy, is psychostimulant drugs such as Ritalin. Ritalin is a mild central nervous system stimulant simlar to amphetamines. It also inhibits the dopamine transporter, increasing the postsynaptic effect of dopamine. In many chidren, Ritalin successfully decreases impulsiveness and inatention, although questions about long-term use remain. 725 CHAPTER 21 THE RESTING BRAIN, ATTENTION, AND CONSCIOUSNESS Daily life suggests that attention is directed in two different ways. Suppose you are walking through a fi eld of grass where amidst the sea of green grows a single bright-yellow dandelion. Your attention may be automatically drawn to the dandelion because the color “pops out” from the background. We say the dandelion “caught our attention.” Certain visual features, such as a distinctive color, movement, or a fl ashing light, draw our attention automatically (Figure 21.3). This is called exogenous attention or bottom–up attention because the stimulus attracts our attention without any cognitive input.

Quite diferent is top–down attention , also called endogenous attention , in which attention is deliberately directed by the brain to some object or place to serve a behavioral goal. You might be fl ipping through this book looking for a passage that you know is in the upper-right corner of a page. The search is made easier by the allocation of attention specifi cally to the page corner. Behavioral Consequences of Attention In most situations, if we want to visually scrutinize something, we move our eyes so that the object of interest is imaged on the fovea in each eye. Implicit in this behavior is the fact that most of the time we pay attention to the object we are looking at. However, it is also possible to shift attention to objects imaged on parts of the retina outside the fovea; this phenoenon of “looking out of the corner of one’s eyes” is called covert attention because our gaze doesn’t reveal what we are attending to. Whether on the fovea or a more peripheral portion of the retina, focusing attention ehances visual processing at that location in several ways. Two ways we’ll look at are enhanced visual sensitivity and faster reaction times. Attention Enhances Visual Sensitivity. Figure 21.4 shows an experiment for studying the effects of directing visual attention to different locations. The observer fi xated on a central point, and her task was to say whether a target stimulus was fl ashed on at a location to the left of the fi xation point, to the right, or not at all. The task was diffi cult because the target was small and fl ashed on very briefl y. The experiment included several special procedures for identifying the effects of attention. Each trial began with the presentation of a cue stimulus at the fi xation point. The cue was either a plus sign, an arrow pointing left, or an arrow pointing right",

In half the trials, there was no further stimulus, and in the other half, a small target circle was fl ashed on for 15 msec at either the left or right position. A key element of the experiment is that the cue was used to direct attention. If the central cue was a plus sign, it was equally likely that a little circle would appear to either the left or the right. The plus sign was thus a “neutral cue.” If the cue was a left arrow, it was four times more likely that the target would appear on the left than on the right. If the cue was a right arrow, it was four times more likely that the target would appear on the right than on the left.

The observer was required to keep her eyes pointing straight ahead, but in order to make the most correct responses on the diffi cult task of detecting the fl ashed circle targets, it would be advantageous to make use of the cue. For instance, if the cue was a right arrow, it would be benefi cial to try to covertly attend to the right target location more than the left. For each of the subjects used in this experiment, the data collected consisted of the percentage of the time a circle was correctly detected. Because there was no target circle in half the trials, the observers could not get a high percentage correct by “cheating” (i.e., by saying there was always a target at the side where the arrow pointed). In trials where the central cue was a plus sign, the observers detected the target stimulus in about 60% of the trials in which one was presented. When the cue was a right arrow, the observers detected the target stimulus to the right on about 80% of the trials in which one was presented there. However, when the cue pointed right, the observers detected the target stimulus to the left in only about 50% of the trials in which one was presented there. With the appropriate left–right reversal, the results were about the same with left arrows. The results are summarized in Figure 21.5. What do these data mean? To answer, we must imagine what the observer was doing. Evidently, the expectation of the observer based on the cues infl uenced her ability to detect the subsequent targets. It apears that the arrow cues caused the observer to shift her attention to the side where the arrow pointed, even though her eyes didn’t move. Presumably, this covert shift of attention made it easier to detect the fl ashed targets compared to the trials when the central cue was a plus sign",

Conversely, the observer was less sensitive to the targets on the side of fi xation opposite to where the arrow cue pointed. Based on these results and those from many other similar experiments, our fi rst coclusion about the behavioral effects of attention is that it increases our visual sensitivity, making things easier to detect. This is probably one of the reasons we can listen in on one conversation among many when we give it our attention. Attention Speeds Reaction Times. Using an experimental technique similar to the one discussed earlier, it has been demonstrated that attetion increases the speed of our reactions to sensory events. In a typical experiment, an observer fi xated on a central point on a computer screen, and target stimuli were presented to either the left or the right of the fi xation point. However, in this experiment, the observer was told to wait until he perceived a stimulus at either location and to press a button when he did. A measurement was made of how long it took the observer to react to the presentation of a stimulus and press a button. Preceding the target was a cue stimulus, either a plus sign or an arrow pointing left or right. The arrows indicated the side to which a stimulus was more likely to appear, whereas the plus sign meant that either side was equally likely. Results from this experiment demonstrated that an observer’s reaction times were infl uenced by where the central cue told him to direct his atention. When the central cue was a plus sign, it took about 250–300 msec to press the button. When an arrow cue correctly indicated where a target would appear (e.g., right arrow and right target), reaction times were 20–30 msec faster. Conversely, when the arrow cue pointed in one diretion and the target appeared at the opposite location, it took 20–30 msec longer to react to the target and press the button",

Nonetheless, there was a small but reliable efect based on which direction the arrows directed the observer’s attention (Figure 21.6). If we assume that attention to visual objects does not have a direct effect on visual transduction or motor coding, we are left with the hypothesis that attention can alter the speed of visual processing, or the time to make a decision about pressing the button. An example from daily experience underscores the behavioral implications of a reation time delay due to attention: If you are driving a car at 60 mph and attending to something other than the road, a 30 msec delay translates into applying the car brakes about 25 feet further down the road, perhaps too late to avoid hitting a car or person. Physiological Effects of Attention What is happening in the brain when we shift our attention to somthing? For example, in the behavioral studies just discussed, is a subject’s performance enhanced because neural activity in a particular brain area is somehow “better”? While it’s conceivable that attention is strictly a high-level cognitive process, experiments demonstrate that the effects of attention can be observed in numerous sensory areas stretching from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to visual cortical areas in the parietal and temporal lobes",

We will look at human brain imaging studies that show activity changes associated with the allocation of attention and then turn to animal studies that reveal the effects of attention on individual neurons. These experiments show the consequences of allocating attetion to a location or feature. Functional MRI Imaging of Human Attention to Location. A key obsevation made in behavioral studies of visual attention is that enhancments in detection and reaction time are selective for spatial location. When we know where an important stimulus is more likely to appear, we move our attention to it and process the sensory information with greater sensitivity and speed. A common analogy is that there is a spotlight of attention that moves to illuminate objects of particular interest or sinifi cance. Experiments using fMRI imaging of the human brain suggest that there may be selective changes in brain activity associated with sptial shifts in attention. In one experiment, subjects in the fMRI machine viewed a stimulus consisting of patches of colored lines arranged in 24 sectors as shown at the bottom of Figure 21.7a. The upper panels in Figure 21.7a show a sequence of four sectors, moving out from the fi xation point, that a suject was cued to attend to. The location of the cued sector changed every 10 seconds. During the 10-second period, the color and orientation of the line segments in all of the sectors changed every 2 seconds. Each time the line segments changed, the subject’s task was to press one button if the lines were blue and horizontal or orange and vertical, and a second button if the lines were blue and vertical or orange and horizontal. The reason for having the subjects perform this task was to force them to atend to a particular sector of the stimulus and ignore the rest. Remember that subjects always kept their gaze fi xed at the center of the bull’s-eye stimulus. The fascinating aspect of this experiment involves what happens when the location of the sector being attended to changes",

The fMRI results dicussed above appear consistent with the behavioral observation that vsual attention can be moved independently of eye position. But attention 730 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR involves more than just location. Imagine walking down a crowded city sidewalk in the winter looking for someone. Everyone is bundled in heavy coats, but you know your friend will be wearing a red hat. By mentally “focusing” on red, it will be much easier to pick out your friend. Evidently, we are able to pay particular attention to visual features such as color to enhance our performance. Is there any refl ection of this attention to features in brain activity? The answer has come from studies using PET imaging in humans. Steven Petersen and his colleagues at Washington University used PET imaging while humans performed a same–different discrimination task (Figure 21.8). An image was fl ashed on a computer screen for about half a second; after a delay period, another image was fl ashed. Each image was composed of small elements that could vary in shape, color, and speed of motion. The task of the observer was to indicate whether the two successive images were the same or different. To isolate the effect of attention, two different versions of the experiment were conducted. In selective-attention experiments, subjects were instructed to pay attetion to just one of the features (shape, color, or speed) and they indicated whether that feature was the same or different in the two images. In divided-attention experiments, subjects simultaneously monitored all features and based their same–different judgments on changes in any feature",

For instance, whereas ventromedial occipital cortex was affected by atention in color (blue spots) and shape (orange spots) discrimination tasks, it was not affected in the speed discrimination task (green spots). Conversely, areas in parietal cortex were infl uenced by attention to the Image 1 Image 2 ▲ FIGURE 21.8 Same–different stimuli used for PET imaging. The observer sees image 1 folowed by image 2.

These effects of attention to different features are roughly cosistent with the tuning properties of neurons in extrastriate visual areas discussed in Chapter 10. The important points to take from these and other brain imaging studies are that numerous brain areas appear to be affected by attetion and that the particular areas depend on the nature of the behaioral task performed. We’ll now examine two of these areas in detail and see how studies in behaving monkeys have clarifi ed the neural effects of attention. Attention Enhances Responses of Neurons in Parietal Cortex. The perceptual studies discussed earlier show that attention can be moved independently of eye position. But what happens normally when you move your eyes to explore your environment? Let’s say you are scrutnizing an object imaged on your fovea when a bright light is fl ashed in your peripheral visual fi eld. What happens to your attention before, duing, and after you make a saccadic eye movement to the fl ashed light? Behavioral studies show that shifts in attention can occur in about 50 msec, whereas saccades take about 200 msec. It appears that attention, initially focused at the fovea, shifts to the peripheral retina and is folowed by the saccade. The assumption that attention changes location prior to an eye movment underlies an experiment performed by neurophysiologists Robert Wurtz, Michael Goldberg, and David Robinson at the National Institutes of Health. They recorded from several brain areas in monkeys to detemine whether shifts of attention are associated with changes in neural activity. Because of the close relationship between attention and eye movements, the investigation started with parts of the brain involved in generating saccades. The researchers recorded from neurons in the posterior parietal cotex of monkeys while the animals performed a simple behavioral task (Figure 21.10)",

    "chunk_text": ". The researchers recorded from neurons in the posterior parietal cotex of monkeys while the animals performed a simple behavioral task (Figure 21.10). This cortical area is thought to be involved in directing eye movements, in part because electrical stimulation here will evoke saccades. In the experiment, a monkey fi xated on a spot on a computer display and a stimulus was fl ashed on the peripheral retina at the loction of the receptive fi eld under study. The monkey was cued to either hold fi xation on the initial spot or saccade to the fl ashed stimulus. In either case, the parietal neuron was excited by the stimulus fl ashing in its receptive fi eld (Figure 21.11a). The observation that makes this eperiment important is that the response to the fl ashed stimulus was sinifi cantly enhanced when the animal made a saccade to foveate it copared to trials in which the monkey held fi xation at the initial location (Figure 21.11b). Remember, the stimulus is the same in both cases. The enhancement effect was seen only when a saccade was made to the rceptive fi eld location but not to other locations and even though the sacade was made after the neuron responded to the target stimulus. This suggests that attention moves to the end of the planned saccade before the eyes move and only neurons with receptive fi elds at that location have responses enhanced by the attention shift that precedes the saccade (Figure 21.11c). A second interpretation that has to be considered is that the enhanced response was a premotor signal related to coding for the Fixation point Screen Target Shift of gaze due to saccadic eye movement ▲ FIGURE 21.10 A behavioral task for directing a mokey’s attention.

If attention drawn to one location in the visual fi eld by a cueing stimulus increases the response to other stimuli near that location, this could account for the spatially selective improvement in the ability to detect a target. Likewise, the augmented response might lead to more rapid visual processing and ultimately faster reaction times, as seen in the perceptual experiments. Attention Focuses Receptive Fields in Area V4. In a fascinating sries of experiments, Robert Desimone and his colleagues, then at the National Institute of Mental Health, revealed surprisingly specifi c efects of attention on the receptive fi elds of neurons in visual cortical area V4. In one experiment, monkeys performed a same–different task with pairs of stimuli within the receptive fi elds of V4 neurons. For eample, suppose that a particular V4 cell responded strongly to vertical and horizontal red bars of light in its receptive fi eld but did not respond to vertical or horizontal green bars. The red bars were “effective” stimuli and the green bars were “ineffective” stimuli. While the monkey fi xated, two stimuli (each either effective or ineffective) were briefl y presented at different locations in the receptive fi eld, and after a delay period, two more stimuli were presented at the same locations. In an experimental session, the animal was cued to base its same–different judgments on the successive stimuli at one of the two locations within the receptive fi eld. In other words, the animal had to pay attention to one location in the receptive fi eld but ignore the other in order to perform the task. The animal pushed a lever one way with its hand if the successive stimuli at the attended location were the same, and the opposite way if the stimuli were different",

Consider what happened in a trial when effective stimuli appeared at the attended location and ineffective stimuli appeared at the other loction (Figure 21.12a). Not surprisingly, the V4 neuron responded strongly in this situation because there were perfectly good “effective” stimuli in the receptive fi eld. The monkey was then cued to base its same– different judgments on the stimuli at the other location in the recetive fi eld (Figure 21.12b). At this location, only green ineffective stimuli were presented. The response of the neuron should have been the same as before because exactly the same stimuli were in the receptive fi eld, right? Surprisingly, that is not what they observed. Even though the stimuli were identical, on average the responses of V4 neurons were less than half as great when the animal attended to the area in the neuron’s receptive fi eld containing the ineffective stimuli. It’s as if the receptive fi eld contracted around the attended area, decreasing the response to the effective stimuli at the unattended location. The location-specifi c effect that attention has on neural activity in this experiment may be directly related to the specifi city discussed earlier in the human detetion experiment. 734 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR Brain Circuits for the Control of Attention We have seen that attention has benefi cial effects on visual processing and that it alters the sensitivity of visual neurons. These are the consequences of attention. We now turn to the brain mechanisms that guide attention, a topic that is more diffi cult to study because the networks of cortical and subcortical structures involved are distributed across the brain. Numerous experiments suggest that the brain circuitry responsible for saccadic eye movements plays a critical role in guiding attention",

This link is consistent with human behavior because we saccade to objects that are either salient or of behavioral interest. We won’t examine every structure thought to be involved in attention but will highlight a few and suggest how control circuits might be organized. The Pulvinar, a Subcortical Component. One structure that has been studied for its possible role in guiding attention is the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus. Several properties of the pulvinar make it interesting. As in other neocortical areas we have discussed, pulvinar neurons rspond more robustly when a monkey attends to a stimulus in the recetive fi eld than they do to the same stimulus when attention is directed elsewhere. Also, the pulvinar has reciprocal connections with most vsual cortical areas of the occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes, giving it the potential to modulate widespread cortical activity (Figure 21.13). Consistent with this anatomical observation, it has been found in mokeys that when attention is drawn to a pulvinar receptive fi eld, there Frame 1 Fixation point Stimuli Response of V4 neuron when effective stimulus is at attended location in receptive field Response of V4 neuron when ineffective stimulus is at attended location in receptive field Stimuli Receptive field Attended location Frame 2 Frame 1 Frame 2 ON OFF ON OFF Attended location (a) Attention to effective stimulus (b) Attention to ineffective stimulus ▲ FIGURE 21.12 The effect of attention in visual cortical area V4.

It sends widespread efferents to areas of cerebral cortex, including areas V1, V2, MT, parietal cortex, and inferior temporal cortex. 735 CHAPTER 21 THE RESTING BRAIN, ATTENTION, AND CONSCIOUSNESS is increased synchronization between neural activity in the pulvinar, area V4, and area IT. As the pulvinar provides input to V4 and IT, the hypothesis is that the pulvinar regulates information fl ow in areas of visual cortex. Humans with pulvinar lesions respond abnormally slowly to stimuli on the contralateral side, particularly when there are competing stimuli on the ipsilateral side. It has been proposed that such a defi cit refl ects a reduced ability to focus attention on objects in the contralateral visual fi eld. A similar phenomenon has been observed in monkeys. When mucimol, an agonist of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, is unilateally injected into the pulvinar, the activity of the neurons is suppressed. Behaviorally, the injection produces diffi culty in shifting attention to cotralateral stimuli, which seems similar to the effect of pulvinar lesions in humans. Interestingly, injection of the GABA antagonist bicuculline appears to facilitate shifting attention to the contralateral side. The Frontal Eye Fields, Eye Movements, and Attention. Tirin Moore and his colleagues, then at Princeton University, examined a cortical area in the frontal lobe known as the frontal eye fi elds or FEF (Figure 21.14). There are direct connections between the FEF and numerous areas known to be infl uenced by attention, including areas V2, V3, V4, MT, and the parietal cortex. Neurons in the FEF have motor fi elds , which are small areas in the visual fi eld",

If a suffi cient electrical current is passed into the FEF, the eyes rapidly make a saccade to the motor fi eld of the stimulated neurons. In one experiment, Moore et al. trained monkeys to look at a computer display that contained numerous small spots of light. They placed an electrode into the FEF and determined the motor fi eld of the neurons at the electrode’s tip. The animal’s task was to fi xate on the center of the visual display but pay attention to one of the spots, the “target” spot, specifi ed by the experimenter. On each experimental trial, if the target spot dimmed, the monkey moved a lever with its hand. If the spot did not dim, the monkey did not move the lever. By varying the light level, the experimenters measured the minimum light difference or threshold needed by the monkey to detect the dimming. The task was made diffi cult for the monkey by “distracter” spots that blinked on and off at random times (Figure 21.15a). Unbeknownst to the monkey, on some trials a very small amount of electrical current was passed into the FEF electrode. Importantly, the curent was insuffi cient to drive the eyes to the motor fi eld, and the animal continued to look at the central fi xation point. The aim of the experiment was to determine whether the small electrical stimulation could enhance the animal’s ability to detect the dimming of the target spot, a sort of atifi cial attentional “boost.” The results are summarized in Figure 21.15b. The histogram shows that when the target stimulus was located inside the motor fi eld, the threshold light difference needed to detect dimming of the target was about 10% less with electrical stimulation than witout. The right side of this histogram shows that performance was not enhanced and may actually have been impaired by electrical stimulation if the target was outside the motor fi eld (as if attention was drawn to the motor fi eld and away from the target)",

They located electrodes in the two areas so that the motor fi eld of the neurons in the FEF overlapped the visual receptive fi elds of the V4 neurons.

Without a visual stimulus to excite the V4 neuron, there was no effect of FEF stimulation on the V4 response, suggesting that the increased V4 activity was an enhancement of a visual response rather than a direct consequence of electrical stimulation. Taken together, Moore’s experiments suggest that FEF stimulation mimics both the physiological and behavioral effects of attention. Other scientists have found similar results with electrical stimulation of the superior colliculus, another structure involved in generating saccadic eye movements. These fi ndings make a compelling case that the guidance of attention is integrated with a system involving the FEF and superior coliculus that is used to move the eyes. Directing Attention with Salience and Priority Maps. In the search for brain processes involved in directing attention, we must consider both bottom–up attention drawn by a stimulus and top–down attention that moves to objects of behavioral importance. A now-common hypothesis to explain how certain visual features grab your attention (e.g., the yellow dandelion surrounded by green grass) is a salience map , an idea itroduced by Laurent Itti and Christof Koch at Caltech. Rather than a brain map showing the locations of objects, a salience map shows the loctions of conspicuous features. This concept is illustrated in Figure 21.17. In Chapter 10, we saw that the visual system has neurons selective for a variety of stimulus attributes, such as orientation, color, and motion, and that visual cortex is organized on the basis of these features (e.g., orientation columns)",

    "chunk_text": ". The fi rst stage in the salience map model consists of maps of individual features that locate areas of high feature contrast (e.g., changes from rightward to leftward movement or red to green). Through neural interactions within a map, a form of competition might suppress responses associated with lower feature contrast. The locations of high contrast in each feature map feed into a salience map that locates areas of high contrast irrespective of the specifi c features. Competition between the locations with high contrast leads to a winning location to which attention is moved. To prevent attention from getting stuck at the single most salient location, however, “inhibition of return” prevents sucessive attentional loci from being the same. As described, this model accounts only for bottom–up guidance of attention. We can add top–down attentional modulation to the model in Figure 21.17 by inserting top–down cognitive input to either the feature maps (“I’m looking for a friend wearing a red hat”) or the salience map (“I remember the key fi gure was on the right side of the page in the texbook”). With this addition, our model no longer simply indicates salience (a bottom–up property of stimuli) but instead indicates attentional prioity. A priority map is a map showing locations where attention should be directed based on stimulus salience and cognitive input. In other words, a priority map is a salience map plus top–down effects.

Salience and priority maps have been studied in visual cortical areas (e.g., V1, V4) as well as cortical areas in the parietal and frontal lobes. In a series of studies, Michael Goldberg at Columbia University, James Bisley at the University of California, Los Angeles, and their colleagues have shown that the lateral intraparietal cortex (area LIP) appears to construct a priority map based on both bottom–up and top–down inputs (Figure 21.18). Area LIP plays an iportant role in directing eye movements, a function clearly related to the guidance of attention. Lesions in the parietal cortex are also associated with the neglect syndrome , in which there is an inability to attend to half of the environment (Box 21.2). An experiment demonstrates a salience effect in LIP that is akin to the experience you might have walking into a familiar room: You might not pay any attention to an old sofa or light fi xture on the wall of your liing room at home, but your attention would be captured by a new puppy jumping on the fl oor. In the experiment, a monkey fi rst sees a computer display, and a neuron in area LIP is shown to respond when an object, say a star, is fl ashed in its receptive fi eld (Figure 21.19a). In the second experiment, eight objects are on the computer display and one of them is the star. The animal initially fi xates a point on the bottom of the display such that the LIP neuron’s receptive fi eld does not encompass any of the objects",

When the fi xation point is moved to the center of the display, the animal makes a saccade that brings the star into the receptive fi eld. Figure 21.19b shows that there is little response in this situation. In a third experiment, the animal fi xates the same location at the bottom of the computer display, and all of the stimuli are shown except for the star (none of the stimuli are in the receptive fi eld). Then, about 500 msec bfore the animal makes a saccade to the central fi xation point, the star is turned on. When the central fi xation point is displayed, the animal makes a saccade to it and the neuron responds vigorously to the star (Figure 21.19c). Note that in this last version of the experiment, the star is not in the receptive fi eld when it is turned on. By the time the eyes move and the star enters the receptive fi eld, the eight objects on the display are FIGURE 21.17 Guiding attention with a salience map. An influential hypothesis for the guidance of attention is that the brain uses a slience map to determine where and what we should attend to. The visual input is analyzed by neurons that are sensitive to the spatial scale of stimulus elements and other stimulus features such as color, intensity, orientation, motion, and so on. The maps for these individual fetures determine where there are signifcant changes in each parameter, such as a transition from one color to another, light to dark, or contours with different orientation. The feature maps are cobined into a salience map that identifies a “winner”—the most conspicuous oject across feature maps that will bcome the next attended location, in this case a bag of money. To ensure the sytem does not become locked on a single salient object, the “inhibition of return” feedback ensures that a current target of attention is inhibited from being the next",

LIP nerons are involved in guiding eye movments and attention. 738 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR O F S P E C I A L I N T E R E S T BOX 21.2 Hemispatial Neglect Syndrome I n Chapter 12, we briefl y discussed the neglect syndrome , in which a person appears to ignore objects, people, and sometimes their own body to one side of their center of gaze. Some have argued that this syndrome is a unilateral defi cit in attention. The manifestations of a neglect syndrome can be so bizarre that they’re hard to believe if not directly observed. In mild cases, the behavior may not be apparent with casual observation. But in severe cases, patients act as if half the universe no longer exists. They may shave only one side of their face, brush the teeth on only one side of their mouth, dress only one side of their body, and eat food from only one side of the plate. Because neglect syndrome is less common following left hemispheric damage, it has primarily been studied in regard to neglect of the left half of space as a result of damage to right cerebral cortex. In addition to neglecting objects to the left side, some patients exhibit denial. For instance, they may say that their left hand isn’t really paralyzed or, in extreme cases, may refuse to believe that a limb on their left side is part of their body. Refer to Figure 12.24 in Chapter 12 as a typical example of the distorted sense of space these patients have. If asked to make a drawing, they may crowd everything into the right half, leaving the left half blank",

    "chunk_text": ". If asked to make a drawing, they may crowd everything into the right half, leaving the left half blank. A particularly drmatic example is the paintings shown in Figure A, which were painted by an artist as he recovered from a stroke. If patients with a neglect syndrome are asked to close their eyes and point toward the midline of their body, they typically point too far to the right, as if there has been shrinage of the left half. If blindfolded and asked to explore objects placed on a table before them, patients behave normally in exploring objects to the right but are haphazard about proing to the left. All of these examples point toward a problem in relating to the space around them. Neglect syndrome is most commonly associated with lsions in posterior parietal cortex in the right hemisphere, but it has also been reported to occur following damage to right hemisphere prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and other areas. It has been proposed that the posterior parietal cotex is involved in attending to objects at different positions in extrapersonal space. If this is true, then neglect syndrome might be a disruption of the ability to shift attention. One piece of evidence supporting this hypothesis is that objects in the right visual fi eld of patients with a neglect syndrome are sometimes abnormally effective in capturing attention, and patients may experience diffi culty disengaging their attention from an object on this side. It is not clear why the syndrome more often accompanies right hemispheric damage than left hemispheric damage. The right hemisphere appears to be dominant for understanding spatial relationships, and in split-brain studies, it has been shown to be superior at solving complex puzzles. This fi nding seems consistent with the greater loss of spatial sense after right hemispheric lesions",

One hypothesis is that the left hemisphere is involved in attending to objects in the right visual fi eld, whereas the right hemisphere is involved in atending to objects in the left and right visual fi elds. While this would account for the asymmetrical effects of left and right hemispheric lesions, at present there is only suggestive evdence in support of such a hypothesis. One fi nal riddle about neglect syndrome is that there is partial or complete recovery in a matter of months (in the fi gure, note the recovery in the self-portraits). Figure A Self-portraits during recovery from a stroke that caused a neglect syndrome. Two months after suffering a stroke affecting parietal cortex on the right side, the artist made the upper-left portrait. There is virtually no left side to the face in the painting. About 3.5 months after the stroke, there is some detail on the left side but not nearly as much as on the right side (upper right). At 6 months (lower left) and 9 months (lower right) after the stroke, there is increasingly more treatment of the left side of the painting.

It appears that the large response in the third experiment is a consequence of turning on the star just before it entered the receptive fi eld. The hypothesis is that the stimulus onset catches the animal’s attention and this enhances the response of the LIP neuron. This effect is consistent with a salience map in area LIP in that the neuron’s response is strongly modulated by a conspicuous bottom–up stimulus. A variation of this experiment brings out a top–down attention effect. This study uses the same eight stimuli, but now they are all always shown (no fl ashing stimuli).

A small cue stimulus is fl ashed on and off, and this indicates to the animal which of the eight stimuli is of behavioral signifi cance in this eperimental trial. In the case illustrated, the LIP neuron does not respond to the star cue because it is outside the receptive fi eld (Figure 21.20a). The fi xation point then moves to the center of the display and the mokey makes a saccade to this location, bringing the star into the receptive fi eld and the neuron responds to the star (Figure 21.20b). Finally, the animal makes a saccade to the star stimulus and the LIP response ends (Figure 21.20c). Compare this response pattern with that observed with identical stimuli when the cue does not match the stimulus that enters the receptive fi eld. As before there is no response to the cue—now a triagle rather than a star (Figure 21.20d). When the animal makes the fi rst saccade, the star enters the receptive fi eld, but the response is much less than before (Figure 21.20e). Finally, the animal makes a second saccade to the triangle (Figure 21.20f). Note that in both the fi rst and second experiments there was a condtion in which the animal made a saccade that brought a stable (not prevously fl ashed) star stimulus into the receptive fi eld.

In bottom–up attention, input from visual areas in the occipital lobe reaches area LIP where the fi rst critical step may be the construction of a salience map based on conspicuous objects in the fi eld of view (see Figure 21.21a). The frontal eye fi elds also contain a salience map, but salience is signaled there after LIP. Through feedback to visual areas and connections with eye movement structures, visual processing of a salient object is enhanced and the eyes may move to foveate the object. Top–down control of attention is directed by behavioral goals, and it is fi tting that the cortical areas in the frontal lobe appear to be critical. Recordings across a range of brain areas show that attention effects folow a temporal sequence, occurring fi rst in the frontal lobe (prefrontal cortex and the frontal eye fi elds) and followed progressively by areas LIP, V4 and MT, V2, and then V1 (see Figure 21.21b). The causal relationships in these brain areas are still being investigated, but we can speculate that behavioral goals are established in the frontal and parietal areas, information is processed to create a priority map in LIP and FEF, and (a) (b) FEF LIP V4 V1, V2 Pulvinar and superior colliculus Lateral prefrontal cortex Bottom-up attention Top-down attention FEF LIP V4 V1, V2 Pulvinar and superior colliculus Lateral prefrontal cortex FIGURE 21.21 The frontoparietal attention network in the macaque brain.

Several of these brain areas, including LIP, FEF, and the suprior colliculus, also serve to guide saccadic eye movements to scrutinize the objects allocated attention. CONSCIOUSNESS In previous chapters, we discussed the sensory systems that bring iformation about our world into the brain. In order to serve behavioral goals, we focus our attention on a small subset of the vast sensory input. Presumably other animals make a similar tradeoff: Broadly monitor sesory input at a low resolution, perhaps with the default mode network, or fi lter out much of the input and pay attention at a higher resolution to only the information needed at the moment. Consider the next step in the chain of brain events—becoming consciously aware of the world around us. It is probably fair to say neuroscientists tend to be materialists in their attitudes about consciousness, meaning that consciousness arises from physical processes: Like every other product of the brain, consciousness can ultimately be understood as being based on the structure and funtion of the nervous system. An alternative to materialism is dualism , which states that the mind and body are different things and one canot be fully explained by the other (i.e., consciousness cannot be fully explained by physical processes)",

What Is Consciousness? The nature of human consciousness is a problem that has vexed philosphers and scientists for centuries. There are challenges right at the outset; even defi ning consciousness is controversial. Suffi ce it to say numerous defi nitions have been offered over the years, and numerous models of cosciousness have been proposed. Our intent is not to jump into this contrversy. However, considering some of the background issues will lead us to a discussion of the type of neuroscientifi c investigations of consciousness that might be fruitful. Think of the ways we use the word itself. We say that a person who is given a general anesthetic or who is asleep is uncoscious and that they become conscious when they wake up. If our hair looks weird one day, we might be self-conscious. A person under the infl ence of a hallucinogenic drug is said to be in an altered state of consciouness. When long wavelength light hits our retina, we have the conscious experience of the color red. But does “conscious” mean the same thing in all of these examples? It seems we use the word in different ways, and understanding these facets of consciousness may involve distinct lines of neuroscientifi c inquiry. In 1995, the philosopher David Chalmers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, proposed a distinction that is helpful starting point. He outlined what he called the easy problems of consciousness and the hard problem. What Chalmers meant by the easy problems of cosciousness are phenomena that seem answerable by standard scientifi c methodology. For example, what is the difference between being awake and asleep? We don’t know the full answer to this question, but as we saw in Chapter 19, research is revealing much and may someday fully outline the nature of conscious wakefulness.

Other brain functions that may give us insight into consciousness include our ability to integrate information from sensory systems, make decisions about sensory input, and so on. The hard problem of consciousness is the experience itself. We eperience the emotion called happiness, the sound of a saxophone, the color blue. Why and how do these subjective experiences arise from physical prcesses? When a baby cries, a mother’s soothing touch evokes some pattern of activity in the child’s brain, but why is the internal experience a pleasant one rather than a feeling of pain, such as the smell of burnt toast, or the sound of a car’s horn? We can look for neural activity associated with these experiences (the easy part of the problem), but understanding why the eperience is the way it is seems much harder. In reality, none of these prolems we’ve mentioned is easy; it may have been more appropriate to refer to the hard problems of consciousness and the seemingly impossible prolem! At any rate, our discussion here will be limited to the “easy” problems. Neural Correlates of Consciousness For centuries, the study of consciousness was in the hands of philosphers; it was widely considered beyond the reach of experimental science. In recent years, this attitude has changed, and a spectrum of scientists are cutting trails through the challenging landscape of consciousness. To make headway, we should ask questions that offer some hope of solution rather than going immediately after the mysteries of internal experience. Christof Koch and Francis Crick, who was awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on the structure of DNA, were two pioneers who collaborated to bring a neuroscientifi c approach to the study of consciousness (Box 21.3)",

In other words, what must happen in which neurons for you to experience the taste of a strawberry or the feeling of joy? A general experimental approach that has been taken starts with vsual images presented to the eyes that can be seen in two different ways, called bistable images. Well-known examples are shown in Figure 21.22. The question we are interested in is what happens to brain activity when a person or animal switches from one percept to another? For example, in Figure 21.22c, at one moment, you see a bunny and later you see a duck (but not both at the same time). Since the image is always the same, the hypothesis is that changes in neural activity that correlate with changes in perception may be related to our conscious awareness of one object or the other. Experiments along these lines have been conducted both in aimals with single neuron recordings and in humans with PET and fMRI. Neuronal Correlates of Alternating Perception in Binocular Rivalry. Binocular rivalry is a visual effect that has been put to good use exploring the neural basis of conscious awareness. In binocular rivalry , different images are seen by the two eyes, and perceptual awareness alternates btween the two images. For example, if one eye sees vertical lines and the other sees horizontal lines, a person will perceive alternations at random times between only vertical lines, only horizontal lines, and sometimes a patchwork of the two orientations. The two images are always the same and both eyes are always open, so what and where is something switching inside the brain? An experiment along these lines was conducted by David Sheinberg and Nikos Logothetis, then at the Baylor College of Medicine. Recordings were ▲ FIGURE 21.22 Bistable images can be perceived two different ways. (a) The face-vase illsion",

Instead of vertical and horizontal lines (or ducks and bunnies), stimuli were used that excited IT neurons. Before the experiment, a monkey was trained to pull a left lever if it saw an object from the “left object group” and a right lever if it saw an object from the “right object group.” For the experiment shown in Figure 21.23, the left object group consisted of pictures of starbursts and the right object group was composed of pictures of animal and human faces. Once the animal reliably indicated whether an object from the left or right group was seen without rivalry, neural recordings in IT were made in a rivalry situation. From baseline recordings, the scientists knew that the particular cell under study gave a strong response to the presentation of a monkey face (to either eye) and little or no response to the starburst pattern. In the rivalry experiment shown in the fi gure, a starburst I t was an everyday occurrence in the summer of 1988 that set my life on a new path while I was teaching summer school in Woods Hole on Cape Cod. I had taken an aspirin, but my toothache persisted. Lying in bed, I couldn’t sleep because of the pounding in my lower molar. Trying to distract myself from the pain, I wondered how it came to hurt so much. I knew that an infl ammation of the tooth pulp sends electrcal activity up one of the branches of the trigeminal nerve.

Such bioelectrical activity in this part of the brain goes hand in hand with the consciousness of pain, incluing its awful, aching feeling. But how could this physical prcess trigger elusive, nonphysical feelings? It’s just a bunch of ions—Na , K , Cl , Ca 2 and so on—moving across mebranes, in principle no different from similar ions sloshing around in my liver or electrons moving onto and off transistor gates in my laptop. As a physicist, I knew that neither quatum mechanics nor general relativity, the two most powerful scientifi c theories that all matter has to obey, make any metion of consciousness. By dint of what natural law could a highly excitable chunk of organized matter exude something nonphysical and give rise to subjective states, to ephemeral feelings? And so my toothache on that distant summer day set me on a course to explore the seas of consciousness, with the brain as my lodestar. I started what became a 16-year collaboration with Francis Crick at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California. Coauthoring over 20 papers and book chapters, we advocated for an epirical research program focused on isolating those neurons and brain regions that are involved in generating a specifi c content of consciousness, such as seeing a horizontal graing rather than a vertical one or seeing red versus green. We felt that no matter what philosophical position people adopt in regard to the mind–body problem, fi nding such neuronal correlates would be a critical step on the way to an ultimate theory of consciousness. Back in 1990, when Francis and I published our fi rst paper on the topic, we were energized by the rediscovery, by Wolf Singer and Charlie Gray in Frankfurt, Germany, of 40 Hz sychronized oscillations in the fi ring pattern of neurons in the visual cortex of cats. We argued that this so-called “gamma band” activity was one of the hallmarks of consciousness",

Today, it is known that such oscillatory activity, widespread in the cortex of all species investigated so far, is probably more closely tied to selective attention than to consciousness, even though these two processes are often intimately relayed. We debated endlessly between ourselves and with a small number of colleagues willing to publicly think about this hitherto banned subject—Nikos Logothetis, Wolf Singer, David Chalmers, Patricia Churchland, Giulio Tononi, and V.S. Ramachandran, to mention a few—about nerve cells and their circuits, both those that must be involved in cosciousness and those that give rise to the myriad types of unconscious behaviors (which we dubbed “zombie systems”) such as speed typing, moving the eyes, adjusting limbs in a dynamic environment, and so on.

The striking result seen in the neural recording is that the response of the IT neuron fl uctuated between low and high activity roughly in sync with the animal pulling the left or right lever, even though the stimulus was fi xed. The results from this experiment and others indicate that there is a correspondence between changes in the activity of IT neurons and percetion. The implication is that binocular rivalry produces an alternation in the conscious awareness the monkey has of the rivalrous images and that neural activity in IT may be a neural correlate of this awareness",

We continued to work together until Francis’s death on July 28, 2004. Two days before, he phoned me on the way to the hospital, calmly informing me that his comments on our last manuscript—on a rather obscure brain region called the claustrum , an elongated sheet of neurons underneath the neocortex, and its putative role in consciousness—would be delayed. His wife, Odile Crick, recounted how in the hours before his death Francis hallucinated about rapidly fi ring claustrum neurons—a scientist to the end. Today, as I write these lines, a new clinical case study of an epileptic patient has just been published. The neurologists stimulated eletrodes implanted into the patient’s brain to discover the lcation where her seizures originated. One electrode, located close to the left claustrum, turned the patient’s consciouness immediately off, repeatedly, and reversibly, for as long as the electrical stimulation lasted. The patient stared, bcame unresponsive to commands, and later had no recolletion of these episodes. Ever data-hungry, how Francis would have loved this! References: Koubeissi MZ, et al. 2014.

Rivalry experiments have also been conducted with human subjects while brain activity is recorded using fMRI. An example is shown in Figure 21.24. Rather than using separate images presented to the left and right eye, a composite image was shown to both eyes; glasses with red and green fi lters assured that one eye saw only the image of the face and the other eye only the house. Subjects indicated which percept they had at different times. Recordings were made from two areas in the temporal lobe. We discussed the fusform face area (FFA) in Chapter 10 because it appears to respond preerentially to pictures of faces. The parahippocampal place area (PPA) responds to pictures of houses and other places but not to other classes of stimuli. As subjects reported alternations between the face and house percepts, FFA and PPA activity was averaged at each transition. In the rivalry condition, house-to-face perceptual transitions were accompanied by decreases in PPA activity (red lines) and increases in FFA activity (blue lines) (see Figure 21.24a). At face-to-house transitions, FFA activity went down and PPA activity up. Similar alternations in FFA and PPA ativity were seen in non-rivalry conditions in which only the face or house was shown at a time to one eye (see Figure 21.24b).

Gabriel Kreiman and Christof Koch at Caltech with Itzhak Fried at the University of California, Los Angeles, conducted an imagery experiment that included recordings from human neurons. For the clinical assessment of epileptic foci, eletrodes were placed in a variety of brain structures. The neuron shown in Figure 21.25 was located in entorhinal cortex, an area in the medial teporal lobe that provides input to the hippocampus. After trying a variety of visual stimuli, it was determined that the neuron responded vigorously to a photograph of dolphins, but little response was evoked by a picture of a girl’s face (see Figure 21.25a). The subject was then asked to close his eyes. His task was to imagine the photo of the dolphins when a high tone was presented and imagine the girl’s face with a low tone.

In an effort to be concrete, our discussion has focused on neural correlates of consciouness (the “easy” problems). We have seen several brain areas in which activity changes in a manner correlated with conscious awareness. These candidate NCC areas are joined by more that we have not discussed. In addition to the fMRI studies, electrode recordings made in a range of cortical areas in animals and humans show responses correlated with awareness even in single cells. Taken together, the experimental fi ndings are encouraging that baby steps may take us closer to an understanding of consciousness, at least in a limited sense. That said, challenges abound in the interpretation of consciousness studies. The goal in the search for neural correlates of consciousness is to fi nd the minimal brain activity suffi cient for some conscious experience. The word “minimal” poses some problems",

For example, it has been found using fMRI that brain activity stretching from early visual areas such as the LGN and V1 to later visual areas such as IT changes systematically when people and animals report switches in rivalrous percepts. Contrast this with animal experiments using eletrodes that show single cell response modulation in extrastriate cortex but much less in earlier structures. The difference may be a technical fator associated with the recording techniques or perhaps the spatial scale and magnitude of conscious modulation. Another conclusion reached in a recent fMRI study is that some investigations of NCCs do not adequately control attention. In other words, awareness may be refl ected only in later areas; what looks like awareness correlations in earlier areas may actually refl ect changes in attention rather than awareness. Despite the concerns we’ve discussed, the neuroscientifi c investigation of consciousness has made huge strides in the past 20 years. Examining situations in which a single sensory input, visual or otherwise, gives rise to more than one percept offers fascinating opportunities for identifying neural correlates of consciousness. This leaves open the “hard problem” of consciousness, but it is a start. CONCLUDING REMARKS In this chapter, we have explored the dynamics of brain activity at a broad scale. Consistent changes between the brain at rest and the bhaviorally active brain have been used to defi ne a default mode network. Moving from a restful state to an active one appears to involve a global switch in brain function from the default pattern to processing tailored to behavioral needs. We cannot say with certainty what the resting state activities are, but they likely include monitoring the environment and daydreaming. When we studied sensory and motor systems, we did so in isolation",

The reality of behavior is obviously different: Sensory information comes in, we attend to a small portion of it that is momentarily important, and we generate motor outputs. Attention is a crucial link in this process. Some animals can surely function without attention, having nervous sytems that hardwire behavioral responses to specifi c types of sensory input (e.g., threats). However, attention confers fl exibility. In some situations, attention is “grabbed,” but in many others, we use attention as a tool to focus our mental resources. We have seen that this involves a network of brain areas that, based on thoughts and goals, constructs priority maps for the allocation of attention followed by selective enhanced processing in sensory cortex. How we become consciously aware of the information we attend to rmains a mystery. We have sidestepped the “hard problem of consciouness,” the reasons why experiences feel the way they do.

The argument in favor of task-performing computational models was well articulated by Allen Newell in 1973 in his commentary “You can’t play 20 questions with nature and win” 1 . Newell was criticizing the state of cognitive psychology. The field was in the habit of testing one hypothesis about cognition at a time, in the hope that forcing nature to answer a series of binary questions would eventually reveal the brain’s algorithms. Newell argued that testing verbally defined hypotheses about cognition might never lead to a computational understanding. Hypothesis testing, in his view, needed to be complemented by the construction of comprehensive task-performing computational models. Only synthesis in a computer simulation can reveal what the interation of the proposed component mechanisms actually entails and whether it can account for the cognitive function in question. If we did have a full understanding of an information-processing mechnism, then we should be able to engineer it. “What I cannot create, I do not understand,” in the words of physicist Richard Feynman, who left this sentence on his blackboard when he died in 1988. Here we argue that task-performing computational models that explain how cognition arises from neurobiologically plausible dynamic components will be central to a new cognitive computtional neuroscience",

We first briefly trace the steps of the cognitive and brain sciences and then review several exciting recent develoments that suggest that it might be possible to meet the combined ambitions of cognitive science (to explain how humans learn and think) 2 and computational neuroscience (to explain how brains adapt and compute) 3 using neurobiologically plausible artificial intelligence (AI) models. In the spirit of Newell’s critique, the transition from cognitive psychology to cognitive science was defined by the introduction of task-performing computational models. Cognitive scientists knew that understanding cognition required AI and brought engineering to cognitive studies. In the 1980s, cognitive science made impotant advances with symbolic cognitive architectures 4 , 5 and neural networks 6 , using human behavioral data to adjudicate between candidate computational models. However, computer hardware and machine learning were not sufficiently advanced to simulate cognitive processes in their full complexity. Moreover, these early developments relied on behavioral data alone and did not leverage constraints provided by the anatomy and activity of the brain. With the advent of human functional brain imaging, scientists began to relate cognitive theories to the human brain. This endeavor came to be called cognitive neuroscience 7 . Cognitive neuroscietists began by mapping cognitive psychology’s boxes (informatioprocessing modules) and arrows (interactions between modules) onto the brain. This was a step forward in terms of engaging brain activity, but a step back in terms of computational rigor. Methods for testing the task-performing computational models of cogntive science with brain-activity data had not been conceived. As a result, cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience parted ways in the 1990s",

Cognitive psychology’s tasks and theories of high-level funtional modules provided a reasonable starting point for mapping the coarse-scale organization of the human brain with functional imaging techniques, including electroencephalography, positron emission tomography and early functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which had low spatial resolution. Inspired by conitive psychology’s notion of the module 8 , cognitive neuroscience developed its own game of 20 questions with nature. A given study would ask whether a particular cognitive module could be found in the brain. The field mapped an ever increasing array of cogntive functions to brain regions, providing a useful rough draft of the global functional layout of the human brain. A brain map, at whatever scale, does not reveal the computtional mechanism (Fig. 1 ). However, mapping does provide costraints for theory. After all, information exchange incurs costs that scale with the distance between the communicating regions— costs in terms of physical connections, energy and signal latency. Component placement is likely to reflect these costs. We expect regions that need to interact at high bandwidth and short latency to be placed close together 9 . More generally, the topology and geometry of a biological neural network constrain its dynaics, and thus its functional mechanism. Functional localization results, especially in combination with anatomical connectivity, may therefore ultimately prove useful for modeling brain infomation processing.

Computational neuroscience has modeled how interacting neurons can implement elementary components of cognition. It is time to assemble the pieces of the puzzle of brain computation and to better integrate these separate disciplines. Modern technologies enable us to measure and manipulate brain activity in unprecedentedly rich ways in animals and humans. However, experiments will yield theoretical insight only when employed to test brain-computtional models. Here we review recent work in the intersection of cognitive science, computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Computational models that mimic brain information processing during perceptual, cognitive and control tasks are beginning to be developed and tested with brain and behavioral data. Despite methodological challenges 10 , 11 , many of the findings of cognitive neuroscience provide a solid basis on which to build. For example, the findings of face-selective regions in the human ventral stream 12 have been thoroughly replicated and generalized. Nonhuman primates probed with fMRI exhibit similar face-seletive regions, which had evaded explorations with invasive electrodes because the latter do not provide continuous images over large fields of view. Localized with fMRI and probed with invasive electrode recordings, the primate face patches revealed high densities of facselective neurons 13 , with invariances emerging at higher stages of hierarchical processing, including mirror-symmetric tuning and view-tolerant representations of individual faces in the anteriomost patch 14 . The example of face perception illustrates, on one hand, the solid progress in mapping the anatomical substrate and characterizing neuronal responses 15 and, on the other, the lack of definitive computational models.

Cognitive neuroscience has mapped the global functional layout of the human and nonhuman primate brain 20 . However, it has not achieved a full computational account of brain information procesing. The challenge ahead is to build computational models of brain information processing that are consistent with brain structure and function and perform complex cognitive tasks. The following recent developments in cognitive science, computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence suggest that this may be achievable. 1. Cognitive science has proceeded from the top down, decoposing complex cognitive processes into their computational coponents. Unencumbered by the need to make sense of brain data, it has developed task-performing computational models at the cogntive level. One success story is that of Bayesian cognitive models, which optimally combine prior knowledge about the world with sensory evidence 21 – 23 . Initially applied to basic sensory and motor processes 23 , 24 , Bayesian models have begun to engage complex cognition, including the way our minds model the physical and social world 2 . These developments occurred in interaction with statistics and machine learning, where a unified perspective on probabilistic empirical inference has emerged. This literature prvides essential computational theory for understanding the brain. In addition, it provides algorithms for approximate inference on generative models that can grow in complexity with the available data—as might be required for real-world intelligence 25 , 26 . 2.

In the past two decades, the field developed mathematical models of elementary computational components and their implementation with biologcal neurons 27 , 28 . These include components for sensory coding 29 , 30 , normalization 31 , working memory 32 , evidence accumulation and decision mechanisms 33 – 35 , and motor control 36 . Most of these coponent functions are computationally simple, but they provide building blocks for cognition. Computational neuroscience has also begun to test complex computational models that can explain higlevel sensory and cognitive brain representations 37 , 38 . 3. Artificial intelligence has shown how component functions can be combined to create intelligent behavior. Early AI failed to live up to its promise because the rich world knowledge required for feats of intelligence could not be either engineered or automaically learned. Recent advances in machine learning, boosted by growing computational power and larger datasets from which to learn, have brought progress at perceptual 39 , cognitive 40 and cotrol challenges 41 . Many advances were driven by cognitive-level symbolic models. Some of the most important recent advances are driven by deep neural network models, composed of units that compute linear combinations of their inputs, followed by static nonlinearities 42 . These models employ only a small subset of the dynamic capabilities of biological neurons, abstracting from fudamental features such as action potentials. However, their funtionality is inspired by brains and could be implemented with biological neurons. b a 100 μ m PC3 PC1 PC2 0 400 0 200 −50 0 50 PC1 PC2 PC3 Gain decrease Gain increase PC1 PC2 PC1 PC4 Left cortical hemisphere Superior Anterior SMFA SEF SMHA M1F S1F IPS RSC V7 V3B OPA V3A LO EBA MT+ OFA V4 V3 V2 V1 FFA PPA S1H S1M S2H S2F AC M1H FEF sPMv M1M FO BA Fig",

If computational models are to explain animal and human cognition, they will have to perform feats of intelligence.

The first part of this review describes bottom-up developments that begin with experimental data and attempt to build bridges from the data in the direction of theory 43 . Given brain-activity data, connectiity models aim to reveal the large-scale dynamics of brain actvation; decoding and encoding models aim to reveal the content and format of brain representations. The models employed in this literature provide constraints for computational theory, but they do not in general perform the cognitive tasks in question and thus fall short of explaining the computational mechanism underlying task performance. The second part of this article describes developments that proceed in the opposite direction, building bridges from theory to experiment 37 , 38 , 44 . We review emerging work that has begun to test task-performing computational models with brain and behavioral data. The models include cognitive models, specified at an abstract computational level, whose implementation in biological brains has yet to be explained, and neural network models, which abstract from many features of neurobiology, but could plausibly be implmented with biological neurons. This emerging literature suggests the beginnings of an integrative approach to understanding brain computation, where models are required to perform cognitive tasks, biology provides the admissible component functions, and the coputational mechanisms are optimized to explain detailed patterns of brain activity and behavior.

    "chunk_text": ". Connectivity models go beyond the localization of activated regions and characterize the interactions between regions. Neuronal dynamics can be mesured and modeled at multiple scales, from local sets of interacing neurons to whole-brain activity 45 . A first approximation of brain dynamics is provided by the correlation matrix among the measured response time series, which characterizes the pairwise ‘functional connectivity’ between locations. The literature on resing-state networks has explored this approach 46 , and linear decopositions of the space-time matrix, such as spatial independent component analysis, similarly capture simultaneous correlations between locations across time 47 . By thresholding the correlation matrix, the set of regions can be converted into an undirected graph and studied with graptheoretic methods. Such analyses can reveal ‘communities’ (sets of strongly interconnected regions), ‘hubs’ (regions connected to many others) and ‘rich clubs’ (communities of hubs) 48 . Connectivity graphs can be derived from either anatomical or functional mesurements. The anatomical connectivity matrix typically resembles the functional connectivity matrix because regions interact through anatomical pathways. However, the way anatomical connectivity generates functional connectivity is better modeled by taking local dynamics, delays, indirect interactions and noise into account 49 . From local neuronal interactions to large-scale spatiotemporal paterns spanning cortex and subcortical regions, generative models of spontaneous dynamics can be evaluated with brain-activity data. Effective connectivity analyses take a more hypothesis-driven approach, characterizing the interactions among a small set of regions on the basis of generative models of the dynamics 50 .

Most work in this area has focused on chaacterizing interactions at the level of the overall activation of a brain region. Like the classical brain mapping approach, these analyses are based on regional-mean activation, measuring correlated flutuations of overall regional activation rather than the information exchanged between regions. Analyses of effective connectivity and large-scale brain dynaics go beyond generic statistical models such as the linear models used in activation and information-based brain mapping in that they are generative models: they can generate data at the level of the measurements and are models of brain dynamics. However, they do not capture the represented information and how it is processed in the brain. Decoding models. Another path toward understanding the brain’s computational mechanisms is to reveal what information is present in each brain region. Decoding can help us go beyond the notion of activation, which indicates the involvement of a region in a task, and reveal the information present in a region’s population actiity. When particular content is decodable from activity in a brain region, this indicates the presence of the information. To refer to the brain region as ‘representing’ the content adds a functional intepretation 51 : that the information serves the purpose of informing regions receiving these signals about the content. Ultimately, this interpretation needs to be substantiated by further analyses of how the information affects other regions and behavior 52 – 54 . Decoding has its roots in the neuronal-recording literature 27 and has become a popular tool for studying the content of representtions in neuroimaging 55 – 59 .

The goal of cognitive computational neuroscience is to explain rich measurements of neuronal activity and behavior in animals and humans by means of biologically plausible computational models that perform real-world cognitive tasks. Historically, each of the disciplines (circles) has tackled a subset of these challenges (white labels). Cognitive computational neuroscience strives to meet all the challenges simultaneously. The content of the representation can be the identity of a sensory stimulus (to be recognized among a set of alternative stimuli), a stimulus property (such as the orientation of a grating), an abstract variable needed for a cognitive operation, or an action 60 . When the decoder is linear, as is usually the case, the decodable information is in a format that can plausibly be read out by downstream nerons in a single step. Such information is said to be ‘explicit’ in the activity patterns 61 . Decoding and other types of multivariate pattern analysis have helped reveal the content of regional representations 55 , 56 , 58 , 59 , prviding evidence that brain-computational models must incorprate. However, the ability to decode particular information does not amount to a full account of the neuronal code: it doesn’t specify the representational format (beyond linear decodability) or what other information might additionally be present. Most importantly, decoders do not in general constitute models of brain computation. They reveal aspects of the product, but not the prcess of brain computation. Representational models",

Representational models. Beyond decoding, we would like to exhaustively characterize a region’s representation, explaining its responses to arbitrary stimuli. A full characterization would also define to what extent any variable can be decoded. Representational models attempt to make comprehensive predictions about the reresentational space and therefore provide stronger constraints on the computational mechanism than decoding models 52 , 62 . Three types of representational model analysis have been intrduced in the literature: encoding models 63 – 65 , pattern component models 66 and representational similarity analysis 57 , 67 , 68 . These three methods all test hypotheses about the representational space, which are based on multivariate descriptions of the experimental condtions—for example, a semantic description of a set of stimuli, or the activity patterns across a layer of a neural network model that processes the stimuli 52 . In encoding models, each voxel’s activity profile across stimuli is predicted as a linear combination of the features of the model. In pattern component models, the distribution of the activity profiles that characterizes the representational space is modeled as a multivariate normal distribution. In representational simlarity analysis, the representational space is characterized by the representational dissimilarities of the activity patterns elicited by the stimuli. Representational models are often defined on the basis of descriptions of the stimuli, such as labels provided by human observers 63 , 69 , 70 . In this scenario, a representational model that explains the brain responses in a given region provides, not a braicomputational account, but at least a descriptive account of the reresentation. Such an account can be a useful stepping-stone toward computational theory when the model generalizes to novel stimuli",

Importantly, representational models also enable us to adjudicate among brain-computational models, an approach we will return to in the next section. Box 1 | The many meanings of “model” The word “model” has many meanings in the brain and behaviral sciences. Data-analysis models are generic statistical models that help establish relationships between measured variables. Examples include linear correlation, univariate multiple liear regression for brain mapping, and linear decoding analysis. Effective connectivity and causal-interaction models are, simlarly, data-analysis models. They help us infer causal influences and interactions between brain regions. Data-analysis models can serve the purpose of testing hypotheses about relationships among variables (for example, correlation, information, causal influence). They are not models of brain information procesing. A box-and-arrow model , by contrast, is an informatioprocessing model in the form of labeled boxes that represent cognitive component functions and arrows that represent iformation flow. In cognitive psychology, such models provided useful, albeit ill-defined, sketches for theories of brain comptation. A word model , similarly, is a sketch for a theory about brain information processing that is defined vaguely by a verbal description. While these are models of information processing, they do not perform the information processing thought to ocur in the brain. An oracle model is a model of brain responses (often instantiated in a data-analysis model) that relies on infomation not available to the animal whose brain is being moeled. For example, a model of ventral temporal visual responses as a function of an abstract shape description, or as a function of category labels or continuous semantic features, constitutes an oracle model if the model is not capable of computing the shape, category or semantic features from images",

An oracle model may provide a useful characterization of the informtion present in a region and its representational format, without specifying any theory as to how the representation is computed by the brain. A brain-computational model (BCM) , by contrast, is a model that mimics the brain information processing uderlying the performance of some task at some level of abstration. In visual neuroscience, for example, an image-computable model is a BCM of visual processing that takes image bitmaps as inputs and predicts brain activity and/or behavioral responses. Deep neural nets provide image-computable models of visual processing. However, deep neural nets trained by supervision rely on category-labeled images for training. Because labeled examples are not available (in comparable quantities) during biological development and learning, these models are BCMs of visual processing, but they are not BCMs of development and learning. Reinforcement learning models use environmental feedback that is more realistic in quality and can provide BCMs of learning processes. A sensory encoding model is a BCM of the computations that transform sensory input to some stage of internal representation. An internal-transformation model is a BCM of the transformation of representations between two stages of processing. A behavioral decoding model is a BCM of the transformation from some internal representation to a bhavioral output. Note that the label BCM indicates merely that the model is intended to capture brain computations at some level of abstraction. A BCM may abstract from biological detail to an arbitrary degree, but must predict some aspect of brain activity and/or behavior. Psychophysical models that predict bhavioral outputs from sensory input and cognitive models that perform cognitive tasks are BCMs formulated at a high level of description. The label BCM does not imply that the model is either plausible or consistent with empirical data. Progress is made by rejecting candidate BCMs on empirical grounds",

Like microscale biophysical models , which capture biological prcesses that underlie brain computations, and macroscale braidynamical and causal-interaction models , BCMs are models of processes occurring in the brain. However, unlike the other types of process model, BCMs perform the information prcessing that is thought to be the function of brain dynamics. Finally, the term “model” is used to refer to models of the world employed by the brain, as in model-based reinforcement learning and model-based cognition . In this section, we considered three types of model that can help us glean computational insight from brain-activity data. Connectivity models capture aspects of the dynamic interactions between regions. Decoding models enable us to look into brain regions and reveal what might be their representational content. Representational models enable us to test explicit hypotheses that fully characterize a region’s representational space. All three types of model can be used to address theoretically motivated questions—taking a hypothesis-driven approach. However, in the absence of task-performing computational models, they are subject to Newell’s argument that asking a series of questions might never reveal the computational mechanism underlying the cognitive feat we are trying to explain. These methods fall short of building the bridge all the way to theory because they do not test mechanistic models that specify precisely how the information processing underlying some cognitive function might work. From theory to experiment To build a better bridge between experiment and theory, we first need to fully specify a theory. This can be achieved by defining the theory mathematically and implementing it in a computtional model (Box 1 )",

Computational models can reside at different levels of description, trading off cognitive fidelity against bilogical fidelity (Fig. 3 ). Models designed to capture only neuronal components and dynamics 71 tend to be unsuccessful at explaining cognitive function 72 (Fig. 3 , horizontal axis). Conversely, models designed to capture only cognitive functions are difficult to relate to the brain (Fig. 3 , vertical axis). To link mind and brain, models must attempt to capture aspects of both behavior and neuronal dynaics. Recent advances suggest that constraints from the brain can help explain cognitive function 42 , 73 , 74 and vice versa 37 , 38 , turning the tradeoff into a synergy. In this section, we focus on recent successes with task-perforing models that explain cognitive functions in terms of representtions and algorithms. Task-performing models have been central to psychophysics and cognitive science, where they are traditionally tested with behavioral data. An emerging literature is beginning to test task-performing models with brain-activity data as well. We will consider two broad classes of model in turn, neural network models and cognitive models. Neural network models. Neural network models (Box 2 ) have a long history, with interwoven strands in multiple disciplines. In coputational neuroscience, neural network models, at various levels of biological detail, have been essential to understanding dynamics in biological neural networks and elementary computational funtions 27 , 28 .

In AI, they have recently brought substantial advances in a number of applications 42 , 74 , ranging from perceptual tasks (such as vision and speech recognition) to symbolic processing challenges (such as laguage translation), and on to motor tasks (including speech synthesis and robotic control). Neural network models provide a common laguage for building task-performing models that meet the combined criteria for success of the three disciplines (Fig. 2 ). Like brains, neural network models can perform feedforward as well as recurrent computations 37 , 76 . The models driving the recent advances are deep in the sense that they comprise multiple stages of linear-nonlinear signal transformation. Models typically have milions of parameters (the connection weights), which are set so as to optimize task performance. One successful paradigm is supevised learning, wherein a desired mapping from inputs to outputs is learned from a training set of inputs (for example, images) and assciated outputs (for example, category labels). However, neural nework models can also be trained without supervision and can learn complex statistical structure inherent to their experiential data. The large number of parameters creates unease among researcers who are used to simple models with small numbers of intepretable parameters. However, simple models will never enable us to explain complex feats of intelligence. The history of AI has shown that intelligence requires ample world knowledge and suficient parametric complexity to store it. We therefore must engage complex models (Fig. 3 ) and the challenges they pose. One chalenge is that the high parameter count renders the models difficult to understand",

The two approaches form the extremes of a continuum of paths toward the common goal of explaining how our brains give rise to our minds. Overall, there is tradeoff (negative correlation) between cognitive and biological fidelity. However, the tradeoff can turn into a synergy (positive correlation) when cognitive constraints illuminate biological function and when biology inspires models that explain cognitive feats. Because intelligence requires rich world knowledge, models of human brain information processing will have high parametric complexity (large dot in the upper right corner). Even if models that abstract from biological details can explain task performance, biologically detailed models will still be needed to explain the neurobiological implementation. This diagram is a conceptual cartoon that can help us understand the relationships between models and appreciate their complementary contributions. However, it is not based on quantitative measures of cognitive fidelity, biological fidelity and model complexity. Definitive ways to measure each of the three variables have yet to be developed.

In addition to testing these models by predicting brain-activity data, the field has begun to test them by predicting behavioral responses reflecting perceived shape 84 and object similarity 85 . Cognitive models. Models at the cognitive level enable researcers to envision the information processing without simultaneously having to tackle its implementation with neurobiologically plausible components. This enables progress on domains of higher cognition, where neural network models still fall short. Moreover, a cognitive model may provide a useful abstraction, even when a process can also be captured with a neural network model. Neuroscientific explanations now dominate for functional coponents closer to the periphery of the brain, where sensory and motor processes connect the animal to its environment. However, much of higher-level cognition has remained beyond the reach of neuroscientific accounts and neural network models. To illustrate some of the unique contributions of cognitive models, we briefly discuss three classes of cognitive model: production systems, reiforcement learning models and Bayesian cognitive models.

These models use rules and logic, and are symbolic in that they operate on symbols rather than sensory data and motor signals. They capture cognition, rather than perception and motor control, which ground cognition in the physical environment. A ‘production’ is a cogntive action triggered according to an if-then rule. A set of such rules specifies the conditions (‘if’) under which each of a range of produtions (‘then’) is to be executed. The conditions refer to current goals and knowledge in memory. The actions can modify the internal state of goals and knowledge. For example, a production may create a subgoal or store an inference. If conditions are met for multiple Box 2 | Neural network models The term “neural network model” has come to be associated with a class of model that is inspired by biological neural networks in that each unit combines many inputs and information is prcessed in parallel through a network. In contrast to biologically detailed models, which may capture action potentials and dnamics in multiple compartments of each neuron, these models abstract from the biological details. However, they can explain certain cognitive functions, such as visual object recognition, and therefore provide an attractive framework for linking cogntion to the brain. A typical unit computes a linear combination of its inputs and passes the result through a static nonlinearity. The output is sometimes interpreted as analogous to the firing rate of a neuron. Even shallow networks (those with a single layer of hidden units between inputs and outputs) can approximate arbitrary functions 123 . However, deep networks (those with multiple hidden layers) can more efficiently capture many of the complex functions needed in real-world tasks.

However, recurrent neural networks, which reprocess the outputs of their units and generate complex dynamics, have brought additional engineering advances 76 and better capture the recurrent signaling in brains 35 , 124 – 126 . Whereas feedforward networks are universal function approximators, recurrent networks are universal approximators of dynamical systems 127 . Recurrent processing enables a network to recycle its limited computational resources through time so as to perform more complex sequences of computations. Recurrent networks can represent the recent stimulus history in a dynamically compressed format, providing the temporal context information needed for current processing. As a result, recurrent networks can recognize, predict, and generate dynamical patterns. Both feedforward and recurrent networks are defined by their architecture and the setting of the connection weights. One way to set the weights is through iterative small adjustments that bring the output closer to some desired output (supervised learning). Each weight is adjusted in proportion to the reduction in the error that a small change to it would yield. This method is called gradient descent because it produces steps in the space of weights along which the error declines most steeply. Gradient descent can be implemented using backpropagation , an efficient algorithm for computing the derivative of the error function with respect to each weight. Whether the brain uses an algorithm like backpropagation for learning is controversial.

Production systems such as ACT-R 5 were originally developed under the guidance of behavioral data. More recently such models have also begun to be tested in terms of their ability to predict regional-mean fMRI activation time courses 87 . Reinforcement learning models capture how an agent can learn to maximize its long-term cumulative reward through interaction with its environment 88 , 89 . As in production systems, reinforcement learning models often assume that the agent has perception and motor modules that enable the use of discrete symbolic represetations of states and actions. The agent chooses actions, observes resulting states of the environment, receives rewards along the way and learns to improve its behavior. The agent may learn a ‘value function’ associating each state with its expected cumulative reward. If the agent can predict which state each action leads to and if it knows the values of those states, then it can choose the most proising action. The agent may also learn a ‘policy’ that associates each state directly with promising actions. The choice of action must baance exploitation (which brings short-term reward) and exploration (which benefits learning and brings long-term reward). The field of reinforcement learning explores algorithms that define how to act and learn so as to maximize cumulative reward. With roots in psychology and neuroscience, reinforcement learing theory is now an important field of machine learning and AI. It provides a very general perspective on control that includes the clasical techniques dynamic programming, Monte Carlo and exhautive search as limiting cases, and can handle challenging scenarios in which the environment is stochastic and only partially observed, and its causal mechanisms are unknown.

Under these conditions, an agent might do better to build a model of its environment. A model can compress and generalize experience to enable intelligent action in novel situations (modebased control). Model-free methods are computationally efficient (mapping from states to values or directly to actions), but statitically inefficient (learning takes long); model-based methods are more statistically efficient, but may require prohibitive amounts of computation (to simulate possible futures) 90 . Until experience is sufficient to build a reliable model, an agent might do best to simply store episodes and revert to paths of action that have met with success in the past (episodic cotrol) 91 , 92 . Storing episodes preserves sequential dependency information important for model building. Moreover, episodic Box 3 | Bayesian cognitive models Bayesian cognitive models are motivated by the assumption that the brain approximates the statistically optimal solution to a task. The statistically optimal way to make inferences and decide what to do is to interpret the current sensory evidence in light of all available prior knowledge using the rules of probability. Consider the case of visual perception. The retinal signals reflect the objects in the world, which we would like to recognize. To infer the objects, we should consider what configurations of objects we deem possible and how well each explains the image.

More formally, a Bayesian model of vision might use a generative model of the joint distribution p ( d , c ) of the sensory data d (the image) and the causes in the world c (the configuration of surfaces, objects and light sources to be inferred) 140 . The joint distribution p ( d , c ) equals the product of the prior , p ( c ), over all possible configurations of causes and the likelihood , p ( d | c ), the probability of a particular image given a particular configuration of causes. A prescribed model for p ( d | c ) would enable us to evaluate the likelihood, the probability of a specific image d given specific causes c . Alternatively, we might have an implicit model for p ( d | c ) in the form of a stochastic mapping from causes c to data d (images). Such a model would generate natural images. Whether prescribed or implicit, the model of p ( d | c ) captures how the causes in the world create the image, or at least how they relate to the image. Visual recognition amounts to computing the posterior p ( c | d ), the probability distribution over the causes given a particular image. The posterior p ( c | d ) reveals the causes c as they would have to exist in the world to explain the sensory data d 141 . A model computing p ( c | d ) is called a discriminative model because it discriminates among images—here mapping from effects (the image) to the causes. The inversion mathematically requires a prior p ( c ) over the latent causes. The prior p ( c ) can constrain the interpretation and help reduce the ambiguity resulting from the multiple configurations of causes that can account for any image. Basing the inference of the causes c on a generative model of p ( d , c ) that captures all available knowledge and uncertainty is statistically optimal (i.e., it provides the best inferences given limited data), but computationally challenging (i.e., it may require more neurons or time than the animal can use)",

If the generative model is mis-specified, then the inference will not be optimal. For real-world tasks, some degree of misspecification of the model is inevitable. For example, the generative model may contain an overly simplified version of the image-generation process. Another challenge is the computation of the posterior p ( c | d ). For realistically complex generative models, the inference may require computationally intensive iterative algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo , belief propagation or variational inference . The brain’s compromise between statistical and computational efficiency 142 – 144 may involve learning fast feedforward recognition models that speed up frequent component inferences, crystallizing conclusions that are costly to fluidly derive with iterative algorithms. This is known as amortized inference 145 , 146 . Bayesian cognitive models have recently flourished in interaction with machine learning and statistics. Early work used generative models with a fixed structure that were flexible only with respect to a limited set of parameters. Modern generative models can grow in complexity with the data and discover their inherent structure 98 . They are called nonparametric because they are not limited by a predefined finite set of parameters 147 . Their parameters can grow in number without any predefined bound. control enables the agent to exploit such dependencies even before understanding the causal mechanism supporting a sucessful path of action",

The brain is capable of each of these three modes of control (model-free, model-based, episodic) 89 and appears to combine their advantages using an algorithm that has yet to be discovered. AI and computational neuroscience share the goal of discovering this algorithm 41 , 90 , 93 – 95 , although they approach this goal from diferent angles. This is an example of how a cognitive challenge can motivate the development of formal models and drive progress in AI and neuroscience. A third, and critically important, class of cognitive model is that of Bayesian models (Box 3 ) 21 , 96 – 98 . Bayesian inference provides an essential normative perspective on cognition. It tells us what a brain should in fact compute for an animal to behave optimally. Perceptual inference, for example, should consider the current sesory data in the context of prior beliefs. Bayesian inference simply refers to combining the data with prior beliefs according to the rules of probability. Bayesian models have contributed to our understanding of basic sensory and motor processes 22 – 24 . They have also provided insights into higher cognitive processes of judgment and decision maing, explaining classical cognitive biases 99 as the product of prior assumptions, which may be incorrect in the experimental task but correct and helpful in the real world. With Bayesian nonparametric models, cognitive science has begun to explain more complex cognitive abilities. Consider the human ability to induce a new object category from a single example. Such inductive inference requires prior knowledge of a kind not captured by current feedforward neural network models 100 . To induce a caegory, we rely on an understanding of the object, of the interactions among its parts, of how they give rise to its function.

These models may not only be generative models in the probabilistic sense, but may be causal and compostional, supporting mental simulations of processes in the world using elements that can be re-composed to generalize to novel and hypthetical scenarios 2 , 98 , 101 . This modeling approach has been applied to our reasoning about the physical 101 – 103 and even the social 104 world. Generative models are an essential ingredient of general inteligence. An agent attempting to learn a generative model strives to understand all relationships among its experiences. It does not require external supervision or reinforcement to learn, but can mine all its experiences for insights on its environment and itself. In particular, causal models of processes in the world (how objects cause images, how the present causes the future) can give an agent a deeper understanding and thus a better basis for infeences and actions. The representation of probability distributions in neuronal poulations has been explored theoretically and experimentally 105 , 106 . However, relating Bayesian inference and learning, especially structure learning in nonparametric models, to its implementation in the brain remains challenging 107 . As theories of brain comptation, approximate inference algorithms such as sampling may explain cortical feedback signals and activity correlations 97 , 108 – 110 . Moreover, the corners cut by the brain for computational effciency, the approximations, may explain human deviations from statistical optimality. In particular, cognitive experiments have revealed signatures of sampling 111 and amortized inference 112 in human behavior.

By declaring their models independent of the implementation in the brain, cognitive scientists are able to address high-level cognitive processes 21 , 97 , 98 that are beyond the reach of current neural networks. Cognitive models are essential for cognitive computational neurscience because they enable us to see the whole as we attempt to understand the roles of the parts. Box 4 | Why do cognitive science, computational neuroscience and AI need one another? Cognitive science needs computational neuroscience, not merely to explain the implementation of cognitive models in the brain, but also to discover the algorithms. For example, the dominant models of sensory processing and object recognition are brain-inspired neural networks, whose computations are not easily captured at a cognitive level. Recent successes with Bayesian nonparametric models do not yet in general scale to real-world cognition. Explaining the computational efficiency of human cognition and predicting detailed cognitive dynamics and behavior could benefit from studying brain-activity dynaics. Explaining behavior is essential, but behavioral data alone provide insufficient constraints for complex models. Brain data can provide rich constraints for cognitive algorithms if leveraged appropriately. Cognitive science has always progressed in close interaction with artificial intelligence. The disciplines share the goal of building task-performing models and thus rely on comon mathematical theory and programming environments. Computational neuroscience needs cognitive science to challenge it to engage higher-level cognition. At the experimental level, the tasks of cognitive science enable computational neuroscience to bring cognition into the lab.

At the level of theory, cognitive science challenges computational neuroscience to explain how the neurobiological dynamical components it studies contribute to cognition and behavior. Computational neuroscience needs AI, and in particular machine learning, to provide the theoretical and technological basis for modeling cognitive functions with biologically plausible dynamical components. Artificial intelligence needs cognitive science to guide the engineering of intelligence. Cognitive science’s tasks can serve as benchmarks for AI systems, building up from elementary cognitive abilities to artificial general intelligence. The literatures on human development and learning provide an essential guide to what is possible for a learner to achieve and what kinds of interaction with the world can support the acquisition of intelligence. AI needs computational neuroscience for algorithmic inspiration. Neural network models are an example of a brain-inspired technology that is unrivalled in several domains of AI. Taking further inspiration from the neurobiological dynamical components (for example, spiking neurons, dendritic dynamics, the canonical cortical microcircuit, oscillations, neuromodulatory processes) and the global functional layout of the human brain (for example, subsystems specialized for distinct functions, including sensory modalities, memory, planning and motor control) might lead to further AI breakthroughs. Machine learning draws from separate traditions in statistics and computer science, which have optimized statistical and computational efficiency, respectively. The integration of computational and statistical efficiency is an essential challenge in the age of big data. The brain appears to combine computational and statistical efficiency, and understanding its algorithm might boost machine learning. Looking ahead Bottom up and top down.

Building and evaluaing such models will require machine learning and big brain and behavioral datasets. Traditionally, each lab has developed its own tasks, datasets, models and tests with a focus on the goals of its own discipline. To scale these efforts up to meet the chalenge, we will need to develop tasks, data, models and tests that are relevant across the three disciplines and shared among labs (see figure). A new culture of collaboration will assemble big data and big models by combining components from different labs. To meet the conjoined criteria for success of cognitive science, computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, the best division of labor might cut across the traditional disciplines. Tasks. By designing experimental tasks, we carve up cognition into components that can be quantitatively investigated. A task is a controlled environment for behavior. It defines the dynamics of a task ‘world’ that provides sensory input (for example, visual stimuli) and captures motor output (for example, button press, joystick control or higher-dimensional limb or whole-body cotrol). Tasks drive the acquisition of brain and behavioral data and the development of AI models, providing well-defined chalenges and quantitative performance benchmarks for comparing models.

The spectrum of useful tasks includes classical psychophysical tasks employing simple stimuli and responses as well as interations in virtual realities. As we engage all aspects of the human mind, our tasks will need to simulate natural environments and will come to resemble computer games. This may bring the added benefit of mass participation and big behavioral data, especially when tasks are performed via the Internet 150 . Data. Behavioral data acquired during task performance prvides overall performance estimates and detailed signatures of success and failure, of reaction times and movement trajectories. Brain-activity measurements characterize the dynamic computtions underlying task performance. Anatomical data can chaacterize the structure and connectivity of the brain at multiple scales. Structural brain data, functional brain data and behavioral data will all be essential for constraining computational models. Models. Task-performing computational models can take sesory inputs and produce motor outputs so as to perform expermental tasks. AI-scale neurobiologically plausible models can be shared openly and tested in terms of their task performance and in terms of their ability to explain a variety of brain and behaioral datasets, including new datasets acquired after definition of the model. Initially, many models will be specific to small subsets of tasks. Ultimately, models must generalize across tasks. Tests.

Moreover, for a given brain, every act of perception, cognition and action is unique in time and cannot be repeated precisely because it permanently changes the brain in question. These complications make it challenging to compare brains and models. We must define the summary statistics of interest and the correspondence mapping between model and brain in space and time at some level of abstraction. Developing appropriate tests for adjudicating among models and determining how close we are to understanding the brain is not merely a technical chalenge of statistical inference. It is a conceptual challenge fundmental to theoretical neuroscience. The interaction among labs and disciplines can benefit from adversarial cooperation 134 . Cognitive researchers who feel that current computational models fall short of explaining an impotant aspect of cognition are challenged to design shareable tasks and tests that quantify these shortcomings and to provide human behavioral data to set the bar for AI models. Neuroscientists who feel that current models do not explain brain information processing are challenged to share brain-activity data acquired during task performance and tests comparing activity patterns between brains and models to quantify the shortcomings of the models.

In astronomy, for example, the theory of Copernicus guided Galileo in interpreting his telescopic observations. Understanding the brain requires that we develop theory and experiment in tandem and complement the bottom-up, datdriven approach by a top-down, theory-driven approach that starts with behavioral functions to be explained 113 , 114 . Unprecedentedly rich measurements and manipulations of brain activity will drive theoretical insight when they are used to adjudicate between brain-computational models that pass the first test of being able to perform a function that contributes to the behavioral fitness of the organism. The top-down approach, therefore, is an essential complement to the bottom-up approach toward understanding the brain (Fig. 3 ). Integrating Marr’s levels. Marr (1982) offered a distinction of three levels of analysis: (i) computational theory, (ii) representation and algorithm, and (iii) neurobiological implementation 115 . Cognitive science starts from computational theory, decomposing cognition into components and developing representations and algorithms from the top down. Computational neuroscience proceeds from the bottom up, composing neuronal building blocks into representtions and algorithms thought to be useful components in the cotext of the brain’s overall function. AI builds representations and algorithms that combine simple components to implement coplex feats of intelligence. All three disciplines thus converge on the algorithms and representations of the brain and mind, contributing complementary constraints 116 . Marr’s levels provide a useful guide to the challenge of understanding the brain. However, they should not be taken to suggest that cognitive science need not consider the brain or that computational neuroscience need not consider cognition (Box 4 )",

Marr was inspired by computers, which are designed by human engineers to precisely conform to high-level algorithmic descritions. This enables the engineers to abstract from the circuits when designing the algorithms. Even in computer science, hoever, certain aspects of the algorithms depend on the hardware, such as its parallel processing capabilities. Brains differ from computers in ways that exacerbate this dependence. Brains are the product of evolution and development, processes that are not constrained to generate systems whose behavior can be perfectly captured at some abstract level of description. It may therefore not be possible to understand cognition without considering its implementation in the brain or, conversely, to make sense of neuronal circuits except in the context of the cognitive functions they support. For an example of a challenge that transcends the disciplines, consider a child seeing an escalator for the first time. She will rapidly recognize people on steps traveling upward obliquely. She might think of it as a moving staircase and imagine riding on it, being lifted one story without exerting any effort. She might infer its function and form a new concept on the basis of a single experience, before ever learning the word “escalator”. Deep neural network models provide a biologically plausible account of the rapid recognition of the elements of the visual exprience (people, steps, oblique upward motion, handrail). They can explain the computationally efficient pattern recognition compnent 42 . However, they cannot explain yet how the child understands the relationships among the elements, the physical interactions of the objects, the people’s goal to go up, and the function of the esclator, or how she can imagine the experience and instantly form a new concept",

On a 20-watt power budget, the brain’s algorithms combine statistical and computational efficiency in ways that are beyond current AI of either the Bayesian or the neural network variety. However, recent work in AI and machine learning has begun to explore the intersection between Bayesian inference and neural network models, combining the statistical strengths of the fomer (uncertainty representation, probabilistic inference, statistical efficiency) with the computational strengths of the latter (reprsentational learning, universal function approximation, computtional efficiency) 117 – 119 . Integrating all three of Marr’s levels will require close collabortion among researchers with a wide variety of expertise. It is diffcult for any single lab to excel at neuroscience, cognitive science and AI-scale computational modeling. We therefore need collaborations between labs with complementary expertise. In addition to convetional collaborations, an open science culture, in which components are shared between disciplines, can help us integrate Marr’s levels. Shareable components include cognitive tasks, brain and behavioral data, computational models, and tests that evaluate models by coparing them to biological systems (Box 5 ).

Corcoran 1 · Giovanni Pezzulo 2 · Jakob Hohwy 1 Received: 6 November 2019 / Accepted: 1 April 2020 / Published online: 29 April 2020 © Springer Nature B.V. 2020 Abstract What is the function of cognition? On one influential account, cognition evolved to co-ordinate behaviour with environmental change or complexity (Godfrey-Smith in Complexity and the function of mind in nature, Cambridge Studies in Philosphy and Biology, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1996). Liberal interprtations of this view ascribe cognition to an extraordinarily broad set of biological systems—even bacteria, which modulate their activity in response to salient external cues, would seem to qualify as cognitive agents. However, equating cognition with adaptive flexibility per se glosses over important distinctions in the way biological organisms deal with environmental complexity. Drawing on contemporary advances in theoretical biology and computational neuroscience, we cash these distinctions out in terms of different kinds of generative models, and the representational and uncertainty-resolving capacities they afford. This analysis leads us to propose a fomal criterion for delineating cognition from other, more pervasive forms of adaptive plasticity. On this view, biological cognition is rooted in a particular kind of funtional organisation; namely, that which enables the agent to detach from the present and engage in counterfactual (active) inference.

Corcoran andrew.corcoran1@monash.edu 1 Cognition and Philosophy Laboratory, School of Philosophical, Historical, and International Studies, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia 2 Istituto di Scienze e Tecnologie della Cognizione, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Rome, Italy Introduction What is cognition? What is it for ? While the former question is a perennial source of philosophical dispute, the latter seems to attract rather less controversy. Cogntion—whatever it consists in and however realised—is ultimately functional to adaptive success. It enables the organism to register information about the state of its environment, and to exploit such information in the service of adaptive behaviour. Cognition, in short, is for action . As benign as this characterisation might appear on first blush, a host of thorier questions lie in wait: Are all varieties of adaptive behaviour mediated by conition, or only a select few? If the former, does this notion of behaviour extend to artificial and multi-agent systems, or is it limited to individual organisms? If the latter, what properties distinguish cognitive from non-cognitive modes of behaiour (assuming there is a clear distinction to be made)? And what of those conitive processes that seem entirely encapsulated from one’s present transactions with the world—how do they fit into the picture? This paper attempts to approach some of these difficult questions indirectly, via an analysis of the principles by which cognition might have evolved. This broadly telenomic strategy—whereby cognitive processes are understood in terms of their fitness-enhancing properties—draws inspiration from Peter Godfrey-Smith’s ( 1996 ) environmental complexity thesis . On this view, cognition evolved to cordinate organismic behaviour with certain complex (i.e. heterogeneous or varable) properties of the eco-niche. Thus construed, cognition functions to generate flexible patterns of behaviour in response to fluctuating environmental conditions",

Thus construed, cognition functions to generate flexible patterns of behaviour in response to fluctuating environmental conditions. We shall not dwell on the details of the environmental complexity thesis here. What interests us, rather, is how the general shape of Godfrey-Smith’s explantory framework—taken in conjunction with more recent advances in theoretcal biology, computational neuroscience, and related disciplines—can inform contemporary philosophical debates about the nature of (biological) cognition. Drawing on insights afforded by these fields, we interpret complexity in terms of uncertainty , and suggest that distinctive profiles of adaptive plasticity emerge as the capacity to represent and anticipate various sources of uncertainty becomes increasingly more sophisticated. This analysis suggests behavioural flexibility per se is not sufficient to determine the cognitive status of an adaptive organism. Rather, we propose a narrower conception of cognition as a process rooted in a particular kind of functional organisation; namely, one that affords the capacity to model and interrogate counterfactual possibilities. This paper is structured as follows: “ Homeostasis and the free energy princple ” begins by considering the homeostatic challenges posed by uncertain envronments. We approach this topic from the perspective of the free energy priciple (Friston 2010 ), a formal account of the autopoietic processes by which biological systems organise and sustain themselves as adaptive agents. “ Beyond homeostasis: Allostasis and hierarchical generative models ” outlines how the thoretical resources of the free energy principle extend to predictive (i.e. allostatic) forms of biological regulation. We focus on two complementary formulations of allostasis, highlighting how these hierarchical control schemes inform fundmental questions about learning, planning, and adaptive behaviour",

We focus on two complementary formulations of allostasis, highlighting how these hierarchical control schemes inform fundmental questions about learning, planning, and adaptive behaviour. “ Biological regulation in an uncertain world ” examines the relation between environmental and biological complexity via an analysis of generative models. We sketch out three scenarios designed to illustrate how different kinds of model architecture endow distinctive capacities for the representation and resolution of uncertainty. Finally, “ Two options for cognition ” elaborates some of the key implications of this analysis for the concept of biological cognition. We argue that cognition does not simply coincide with adaptive biological activity (allostatic or otherwise), but inheres rather in the agent’s capacity to disengage from the present and entertain counterfactual states of affairs. Homeostasis and the free energy principle The free energy principle provides a mathematical framework explaining how adative organisms come to exist, persist, and thrive—at least for a while—by resisting what Schrödinger described as “the natural tendency of things to go over into diorder” ( 1992 , p. 68). In this section, we sketch a relatively non-technical overview of this perspective, and show how it relates to familiar notions of homeostasis and adaptive behaviour. 1 Life, formalised: thermodynamics, attracting sets, and (un)certainty The free energy principle starts with the simple (but fundamental) premise that organisms must maintain the stability of their internal dynamics in order to survive (Bernard 1974 ; Cannon 1929 ; Friston 2012a ). This is to say that living systems must act to preserve their structural and functional integrity in the face of environmental perturbation (cf. autopoiesis; Maturana and Varela 1980 ), thereby resisting the tedency to disorder, dispersal, or thermodynamic entropy alluded to by Schrödinger (Friston 2013 ; Nicolis and Prigogine 1977 )",

In other words, they maintain invariant (steady-state) characteristics far from equilibrium—as open sytems in exchange with their environment. 3 It follows from this postulate that any entity qua adaptive biological system can be expected to frequent a relatively small number of attracting states ; namely 1 For broader philosophical discussion of these ideas in the context of predictive processing, see Clark ( 2016 ), Hohwy ( 2013 ) and Wiese and Metzinger ( 2017 ). For more technical explications of the free energy principle and its corollaries, see Bogacz ( 2017 ), Buckley et al. ( 2017 ) and Friston et al. ( 2017a ). 2 Technically, living systems appear to violate fluctuation theorems that generalise the second law of thermodynamics to nonequilibrium systems (Evans and Searles 1994 , 2002 ; Seifert 2012 ). 3 See Linson et al. ( 2018 ), for a lucid explication of the deep continuities between thermodynamics and the free energy principle. For a more technical exposition, see Sengupta et al. ( 2013 ). those which compose its attracting set (Friston 2012a , 2013 ). In dynamical systems theoretic terms, this set of states corresponds to a random dynamical attractor , the invariant set towards which the system inevitably evolves over time (Crauel and Flandoli 1994 ). The existence of this invariant set means that the probability of fining the system in any given state can be summarised by a distribution (technically, an ergodic density ), which can be interpreted in terms of its information - theoretic entropy or uncertainty (Shannon 1948 )",

The upshot of this picture is that any biotic (random dynamical) system which endures over time must do so in virtue of maintaining a low-entropy distribution over its attracting set (Friston 2012a ; Friston and Ao 2012 ). This is tantamount to saying there is a high degree of certainty concerning the state of the system at any given moment in its lifetime, and that such attracting states will correspond to the conditions of the organism’s homeostatic integrity. Conversely, there is a low proability of finding the system occupying a state outside of its attracting set, since such states are incompatible with the system’s (long-term) existence. It follows that the repertoire of attracting states in which the system is typically located is constitutive of that agent’s phenotype (Friston et al. 2009 , 2010a ), insofar as the phenotype is simply a description of the organism’s characteristic (i.e. typically-observed) states. Surprise and free energy minimisation According to this framework, then, homeostasis amounts to the task of keeping the organism within the bounds of its attracting set (or, equivalently, of maintaining a low conditional entropy over its internal states). How might biological agents realise this outcome? To answer this question, we must invoke another information-theoretic term: suprise (Shannon 1948 ). Surprise (i.e. ‘surprisal’ or self-information) quantifies the improbability (i.e. negative log-probability) of some outcome. In the present cotext, the outcome in question refers to some sensory state induced in any part of the system receptive to perturbation. Obvious realisers of sensory states include the sensory epithelia (e.g., retinal photoreceptor cells), but also extend to ion channel receptors in cell membranes, photosensitive receptors in plants, and so on. These receptive surfaces can be construed as states embedded within a (statistical) bounary or interface (technically, a Markov blanket ; Pearl 1988 ) separating (i.e",

These receptive surfaces can be construed as states embedded within a (statistical) bounary or interface (technically, a Markov blanket ; Pearl 1988 ) separating (i.e. ‘shieling’ or ‘screening-off’) system-internal from system-external conditions (see Friston 2013 ; Friston and Ao 2012 ; Hohwy 2017a ). 4 Importantly, the quantity of surprise associated with any given sensory state is not absolute, but depends rather on the kind of system the organism embodies (i.e. its phenotype or internal configuration; Friston and Stephan 2007 ). The fish that finds itself on dry land (i.e. well beyond the bounds of its attracting set) experiences a high degree of surprise, and will perish unless something is done (quickly!) to 4 Note that complex organisms may be composed of multiple, hierarchically-nested Markov blankets (for recent discussion, see Allen and Friston 2018 ; Clark 2017 ; Kirchhoff et al. 2018 ; Palacios et al. 2020 ; Ramstead et al. 2018 ). reinstate its usual milieu. Conversely, this very same state will elicit relatively little surprise in land-dwelling creatures. It turns out that minimising or suppressing the surprise evoked by sensory states—that is, by avoiding surprising states and favouing unsurprising ones—the agent will tend to keep the (conditional) entropy of its states low, since entropy (almost certainly) converges with the long-term time aveage of surprise (Birkhoff 1931 ; Friston and Ao 2012 ). In other words, by avoiding surprising interactions with their environment, bilogical systems keep themselves within the neighbourhood of attracting states that are conducive to their ongoing existence. Indeed, as a random dynamical system that repeatedly revisits its attracting set over time, the agent thereby realises itself as its own random dynamical attractor—and by extension, its own ‘existence proof’ (Friton 2018 ; more on which shortly)",

    "chunk_text": ". There is, however, an important complication to this story: Surprise is comptationally intractable, since its direct evaluation would require the agent to possess exhaustive knowledge of the external dynamics responsible for its sensory experences (Friston 2009 ). This is where the concept of free energy minimisation comes in. Variational free energy is an information-theoretic quantity developed to finesse difficult integration problems in quantum statistical mechanics (Feynman 1972 ). 5 In the present context, free energy serves as a proxy for the amount of surprise elicited by sensory inputs (Friston 2010 , 2011 ). As free energy is a function of the agent’s sensory and internal states (i.e. two sources of information available to the agent), and can be minimised to form a tight (upper) bound on sensory surprise, free energy minimisation enables the agent to indirectly evaluate the surprise associated with its sensory states (Friston and Stephan 2007 ). Moreover, since the agent is also capble of evaluating how free energy is likely to change in response to state transitions (Friston et al. 2012d ), it will appear to select (or ‘sample’) actions that reduce suprise (Friston et al. 2015b ). 6 The free energy principle thus implies that biological systems will tend to avoid (or suppress) surprising observations over the long-run, thereby restricting themselves within the neighbourhood of their invariant (attracing) set. Naturally, this explanation raises yet further questions: How does the agent minmise free energy to a ‘tight bound’ on surprise? How can simple organisms ‘expect’ to occupy certain states, or be said to ‘prefer’ these states over others? In order to address such questions, we first need to elaborate a notion of the agent as a genertive model . 5 Variational inference techniques are also widely used in machine learning to approximate density funtions through optimisation (see Blei et al. 2017 )",

The extent to which the free energy principle should be construed as a useful heuristic for describing and predicting adaptive behaviour (a kind of intentional stance ; Dennett 1987 ), versus a more substantive ontological claim, remains an open question. That said, recent progress has been made towards casting the free energy principle as a process theory of consideable explanatory ambition (Friston et al. 2017a ). Existence implies inference: agents as generative, self‐evidencing models According to the free energy principle, adaptive biological agents embody a proabilistic, generative model of their environment (Calvo and Friston 2017 ; Friston 2008 , 2011 , 2012a ; Kirchhoff et al. 2018 ; Ramstead et al. 2018 ). As we shall see, this is a rather bold claim that moves us far beyond conventional accounts of homostatic regulation 7 and their reformulation in the language of statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory. Roughly, the system’s form and internal configuration are said to parameterise a probabilistic mapping between the agent’s sensory states and the external (hiden) causes of such states. This is to say that organisms interact with their eco-niche in ways that distill and recapitulate its causal structure, meaning that biological agents constitute (embody) a statistical model encoding conditional expectations about environmental dynamics (Allen and Friston 2018 ; Friston 2011 ; Kirchhoff et al. 2018 ). 8 Indeed, according to the free energy principle, the very existence of the organism over time implies that it must optimise a generative model of the extenal causes of its sensory flows",

This follows from the observation that optimising a model of the hidden dynamics impinging on one’s sensory surfaces will give rise to (free-energy minimising) exchanges with the environment, which manifest as adative responses to evolving external conditions (Friston et al. 2006 ; Friston and Stphan 2007 ). Under this account, then, even such simple biological agents as unicellular orgaisms will ‘expect’ (abstractly and nonconsciously) to find themselves in certain (unsurprising) states, according to the model they embody. Moreover, such agents will strive to sample (i.e. bring about) those attracting, free energy minimising states they expect to occupy—or risk perishing (Friston et al. 2006 ; Friston and Stephan 2007 ). In Bayesian terms, this activity of expectation-fulfilment (or maximisation)— where expectations correspond to prior probability distributions parameterised by the agent’s internal states—is tantamount to maximising the evidence for the agent’s model (and by extension, their own existence; Friston 2010 , 2013 ), a process known as self - evidencing (Hohwy 2016 ). Hence, under the free energy principle, adaptive biological systems conserve their own integrity through free energy minimising interactions which, over the long-term time average, minimise entropy (i.e. resolve uncertainty) and maximise self-evidence. 9 The process by which they accomplish this feat is active inference . 9 See Parr and Friston ( 2018b ) for a mathematical explanation of the (bound) relationship between varational free energy and model evidence. 7 Note that we interpret the notion of regulation rather broadly here.

On this view, regulatory control consists in a special kind of functional organisation characteised in terms of second-order control . This formulation seems broadly in line with our understanding of allostasis (see “ Beyond homeostasis: Allostasis and hierarchical generative models ”). 8 Note that the organism’s morphology and internal organisation impose constraints on the way it moels and represents environmental dynamics (e.g., Parr and Friston 2018a )—a point we shall elaborate in “ Biological regulation in an uncertain world ”. Active inference: closing the perception–action loop The scheme outlined above implies that biological agents conserve their morphoogy and internal dynamics (and in turn, the generative model these characteristics embody) by acting to offset the dispersive effects of random environmental fluctutions. But why should the agent sustain its model through such adaptive exchanges, rather than allowing its model to change in line with evolving environmental dynaics? As it turns out, the free energy principle supports both of these possibilities: agent and environment are locked in a perpetual cycle of reciprocal influence. This dialectical interplay, which emphasises the inherent circular causality at the heart of adaptive behaviour, is formalised under the active inference process theory (Friston et al. 2017a ). Active inference comprises two basic processes that play out at the agent-envronment interface: perception and action. 10 Here, perception is construed as the process of changing (i.e. ‘updating’) one’s internal states in response to external perturbations, and over longer timescales corresponds to learning (i.e. Bayesian updating of time-invariant model parameters; Fitzgerald et al. 2015 ; Friston et al. 2016 , 2017a )",

Bayesian updating of time-invariant model parameters; Fitzgerald et al. 2015 ; Friston et al. 2016 , 2017a ). 11 In other words, perceptual (state) inference describes how the agent updates its representation of environmental dynamics to resolve uncertainty about the hidden causes of its sensory fluctuations. A prevalent neurocomputational implmentation of this scheme is predictive coding (Elias 1955 ; Lee and Mumford 2003 ; Rao and Ballard 1999 ; Srinivasan et al. 1982 ; Huang and Rao 2011 ; Spratling 2017 ; for some variational free energy treatments, see Barrett and Simmons 2015 ; Bastos et al. 2012 ; Friston and Kiebel 2009 ; Pezzulo 2014 ; Seth et al. 2012 ; Shipp et al. 2013 ; Shipp 2016 ). Action, on the other hand, involves the activation of effector mechanisms (e.g., motor reflexes, cell migration; Friston et al. 2015a ) in order to bring about new sesory states (Adams et al. 2013 ; Friston et al. 2010a ). Different states can be sampled either through actions that directly intervene on the environment (e.g., turning off a bright light), or alter the relationship between the agent’s sensory surfaces and external states (e.g., turning away from a bright light). In either case, free energy is affected by the sensory consequences of the agent’s actions, where expectations 10 While active inference is sometimes narrowly construed as the active or behavioural component of the perception–action loop, the term was originally introduced to characterise the reciprocal interplay between perception and action (e.g., Friston et al. 2009 , p. 4). This broader interpretation emphasises the deep continuity of the (Bayesian inferential) processes underwriting perception, learning, planning, and action under the free energy principle (Friston et al. 2017a ). 11 This general understanding of perception need not entail the conscious experience of sensations, just as learning can occur through entirely unconscious—and even artificial—mechanisms",

Rather, what is at stake here is the statistical notion of Bayesian belief , where probability distributions encode the condtional probability that sensory observation Y was caused by hidden state X . about the modifiability of sensory flows are conditioned on a model of hidden states and their time-evolving trajectories (Friston and Ao 2012 ). 12 Active inference thus recalls the cybernetic adage that organisms “control what they sense , notwhat they do ” (Powers 1973 , p. 355, emphasis in original). Although we shall have more to say about the role of action under active infeence in later sections, these cursory remarks are sufficient to motivate the basic claim that adaptive agents recruit effector systems in order to propel themselves towards the sensory states they expect to inhabit. Superficially at least, the inferential dynamics underwriting perception and action seem to pull in opposing directions (i.e. change the model to reflect the world vs. change the world to reflect the model ). Under the active inference scheme, however, these two processes are complementary and deeply interwoven. This is because peception can only minimise free energy (or, under certain simplifying assumptions, prediction error ; Friston 2009 ; Friston et al. 2007 ) to a tight (upper) bound on suprise, whereas action suppresses surprise by invoking new sensory states that coform to (expectations prescribed by) the agent’s phenotype. Consequently, percetion serves to optimise the agent’s model of environmental conditions, such that the agent has adequate information to choose actions that engender low sensory entropy (Friston et al. 2010a )",

Rather, the exigencies of homeostatic control dictate that biological systems preserve the conditional independence of their intenal and external states (Ramstead et al. 2018 ). This is to say that the biological agent must maintain a boundary (i.e. Markov blanket) that separates (and insulates) its internal dynamics from external conditions. 14 Consequently, the free energy minmising agent must exploit inferences about the state of the world beyond its Markov blanket in order to act in ways that keep it within the neighbourhood of its attracting states (Friston 2013 ). The agent’s capacity to maintain the integrity of its Markov blanket is aided by prior beliefs about the sorts of conditions it expects to encounter. Many such expetations are directly functional to homeostasis (Pezzulo et al. 2015 ), having been 12 Technically, actions are physical, real-world states that are not represented within the agent’s genertive model (Attias 2003 ). Rather, the agent infers (fictive) ‘control’ states that explain the (sensory) cosequences of its actions (Friston et al. 2012a , d ). Action selection (or decision-making) thus amounts to the optimisation of posterior beliefs about the control states that determine hidden state transitions (Friston et al. 2013 , 2015b ). 13 Although one might be tempted to subordinate perceptual inference to free energy minimising action, we interpret perception and action as mutually dependent moments within a unified dynamical loop (cf. the perception–action cycle; Fuster 2001 , 2004 ). Ultimately, both modes of active inference are in the service of uncertainty reduction: Percepts without actions are idle; actions without percepts are blind",

Ultimately, both modes of active inference are in the service of uncertainty reduction: Percepts without actions are idle; actions without percepts are blind. 14 Formally speaking, the sensory and active states that compose the Markov blanket render the proability distributions over internal and external states statistically independent of one another (see Pearl 1988 ). In other words, internal and external states provide no additional information about one another once the Markov blanket’s active and sensory states are known. shaped and refined through generations of natural selection (Allen and Friston 2018 ; de Vries and Friston 2017 ; Friston 2010 ). Pushing this logic one step further, we can say that the agent embodies a deeply-engrained expectation to survive (i.e. to remain within the confines of its attracting set—and thus to maintain its homeostatic integrity over time); this is simply the expectation to minimise average surprise over the long-run (Allen and Tsakiris 2018 ; Seth 2015 ). This remark highlights the point that not all beliefs are equally amenable to model updating. Rather, certain stronglheld or high - precision beliefs (e.g., those pertaining to homeostatic stability) will be stubbornly defended through actions that seek to substitute conflicting sensory evdence with input that conforms more closely to prior expectations (Yon et al. 2019 ). In sum, perception and action work in concert to achieve free energy minimistion, ensuring that the biological system maintains itself in an invariant relationship with its environment over time. Critically, this formulation explains how apparently teleological or purposive behaviours emerge as a consequence of free energy minmising sensory sampling, without resorting to additional concepts such as ‘value’ or ‘reward’ (Friston et al. 2009 , 2010a )",

Rather, value and reward simply fall out of the active inference process, as what is inherently valuable or rewarding for any particular organism is prescribed by the attracting states that compose its phenotype (i.e. those states the agent expects itself to occupy; Friston and Ao 2012 ). Simply put, unsurprising (i.e. expected) states are valuable; hence, minimising free energy corresponds to maximising value (Friston et al. 2012a ). 15 Beyond homeostasis: allostasis and hierarchical generative models The free energy principle is founded on the premise that biological systems act to maintain their homeostatic equilibrium in the face of random environmental pertubations. Until recently, however, the question of how adaptive organisms secure their homeostatic integrity had attracted relatively little theoretical attention from within this perspective. A growing number of researchers are now leveraging predictive coding and active inference to explain how complex nervous systems monitor intenal bodily states (i.e. perceptual inference in the interoceptive domain) and regulate physiological conditions (Allen et al. 2019 ; Barrett and Simmons 2015 ; Iodice et al. 2019 ; Seth 2013 ; Pezzulo 2014 ; for recent reviews, see Khalsa et al. 2018 ; Owens et al. 2018 ; Quadt et al. 2018 ). An important conceptual development within this line of work was the move beyond traditional notions of homeostatic stability to more modern accounts of allostatic variability. The concept of allostasis (“stability through change”) was first introduced by Sterling and Eyer ( 1988 ), who criticised conventional homeostatic control theory as overly restrictive and reactive in character. 16 By contrast, allostasis 15 Note that value here is not equivalent to expected utility, but rather a composite of utility ( extrinsic value ) and information gain ( epistemic value ; see Friston et al. 2015b ; Schwartenbeck et al. 2015 )",

Allostasis was thus posited to account for a wide variety of anticipatory physiological activity that resisted explanation in terms of closeloop control. Despite controversy over the theoretical merits and conceptual scope of allostasis (see Corcoran and Hohwy 2018 , for a recent overview), there is ample evidence that biological regulation consists in both anticipatory and reactive modes of compenstion (see for e.g., Burdakov 2019 ; Ramsay and Woods 2016 ; Schulkin and Sterling 2019 ). 17 These complementary mechanisms are easily accommodated within the active inference framework, mapping neatly onto the hierarchically-stratified models posited under the free energy principle (Friston 2008 ). Moreover, we believe that mature versions of allostatic theory are enriched and invigorated by active inference, insofar as the latter furnishes precisely the kind of inferential machinery required to underwrite effective forms of prospective control across various timescales (Corcran and Hohwy 2018 ; Kiebel et al. 2008 ; Friston et al. 2017d ; Pezzulo et al. 2018 ).

The remainder of this section briefly outlines two recent attempts to integrate homeostatic and allostatic mechanisms within the broader scheme of active infeence. Although these perspectives assume a rather complex, neurally-implemented control architecture, we shall argue in “ Biological regulation in an uncertain world ” that the basic principles underwriting such schemes can be generalised to much sipler biological systems with relative ease. Allostasis under active inference Stephan and colleagues (Stephan et al. 2016 , see also Petzschner et al. 2017 ) deveoped an active inference-based account of allostasis that maps interoception and physiological regulation onto a three-layer neural hierarchy. At the lowest level of this hierarchy are homeostatic reflex arcs , which operate much like classical feeback loops (i.e. deviation of an essential variable beyond certain limits elicits an error signal, which in turn triggers a countervailing effector response; see Ashby 1956 , Ch. 12; Wiener 1961 , Ch. 4). Critically, however, the range of states an essetial variable may occupy is prescribed by intermediate-level allostatic circuits . This formulation thus recasts essential variable setpoints as (probabilistic) prior expecttions (or equivalently, top-down model-based predictions) about the likely states of interoceptors (cf. Penny and Stephan 2014 ), with deviations from expected states provoking interoceptive prediction error. 18 17 Indeed, evidence of anticipatory physiological regulation antedates Walter B. Cannon’s influential work—Ivan Pavlov’s ( 1902 ) Nobel prize-winning research on the digestive system demonstrated that gastric and pancreatic enzymes are secreted before nutrient ingestion (see Smith 2000 ; Teff 2011 ). 18 This formulation is congruent with contemporary efforts to finesse traditional notions of setpoint rigidity with more dynamic accounts of homeostatic control (e.g., Cabanac 2006 ; Ramsay and Woods 2014 ; cf. Ashby 1940 )",

    "chunk_text": ". Ashby 1940 ). It also seems more felicitous to Cannon’s original conception of homeostatic cotrol (see for e.g., Cannon 1939 , p. 39). Two important features of this account are that (1) prior expectations about essetial variables encode a distribution over states (rather than a singular ideal refeence value), and that (2) the sufficient statistics which specify this distribution—its mean and precision (inverse variance)—are free to vary (cf. Ainley et al. 2016 ). On this view, such classic allostatic phenomena as diurnal patterns of body temperature (Kräuchi and Wirz-Justice 1994 ) and blood pressure variation (Degaute et al. 1991 ) emerge as a consequence of the cyclical modulation of the priors over these physological states (cf.

Likewise, phasic increases or decreases in the stability of such variables correspond to periodic shifts between moror lesprecise distributions, respectively. 19 Subordinating homeostatic reflex arcs to allostatic circuits transforms the trditional conception of physiological control as setpoint defence into a far more dynamic and context-sensitive process. Access to perceptual and cognitive reprsentations (e.g., via the anterior insular and cingulate cortices; Barrett and Simmons 2015 ; Craig 2009 ; Gu et al. 2013 ; Menon and Uddin 2010 ; Paulus and Stein 2006 ) enables allostatic circuitry to harness multiple streams of information such that homeostatic parameters may be deftly altered in preparation for expected enviromental changes (Ginty et al. 2017 ; Peters et al. 2017 ). Not only does this arrangment enable the system to anticipate periodic nonstationarities in essential variable dynamics (such as the circadian oscillations in body temperature and blood pressure mentioned above), it also confers potentially vital adaptive advantages under unepected and uncertain conditions.

Registering its perilous situation, the animal’s brain triggers a cascade of autonomic activity—the ‘fight-or-flight’ response famously characteised by Cannon ( 1914 , 1915 ). On Stephan and colleagues’ ( 2016 ) account, these rapid physiological alterations are mediated via the allostatic enslavement of homestatic reflex loops. This generative model-based scheme explains why physiological parameters should change so dramatically in the absence of any immediate homestatic disturbance: Predictions (or ‘forecasts’; Petzschner et al. 2017 ) about the likely evolution of external conditions mandate the adoption of atypical, metabolically expensive states in preparation for evasive action (cf. Requin et al. 1991 ). Notice that the physiological states realised via allostatic modulation of homestatic loops might themselves constitute surprising departures from the organism’s typically-expected states. Since these deviations cannot be resolved locally on account of the higher-order imperative to mobilise metabolic resources for impening action, interoceptive prediction error propagates up the neural hierarchy, posibly manifesting as the suite of sensations associated with acute stress (Peters et al. 2017 ). Such prediction error is tolerated to the extent that these emergency meaures are expected to expedite a more hospitable environment (namely, one in which there is no immediate threat of predation). In other words, allostatic regimes of 19 Note that priors over certain physiological variables (e.g., core temperature, blood pH) are likely to be held with greater precision—and thus restricted to a narrower range of attracting states—than others (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate; see Allen and Tsakiris 2018 ; Seth and Friston 2016 ; Yon et al. 2019 )",

This processing level is posited to explain the emergence of higher-order beliefs about one’s abiity to adaptively respond to homeostatic perturbation. Persistent failure to suppress interoceptive surprise—either as a consequence of harbouring inaccurate allostatic expectations, or one’s inability to realise free energy minimising actions—results in a state of dyshomeostasis (cf. allostatic load ; McEwen and Stellar 1993 ; Peters et al. 2017 ), the experience of which may erode confidence in one’s capacity for self-regulation. Stephan and colleagues (2016) speculate that the affective and intetional states engendered by chronic dyshomeostasis contribute to the development of major depressive disorder (cf. Badcock et al. 2017 ; Barrett et al. 2016 ; Seth and Friston 2016 ). Although such psychopathological implications are beyond the scope of this paper, the basic idea that the brain’s homeostatic/allostatic architecture is reciprocally coupled with higher-order inferential processing will be explored futher in “ Biological regulation in an uncertain world ”. In sum, the hierarchical regulatory scheme proposed by Stephan and colleagues (2016) provides a promising formal description of the inferential loops underwriting both reactive (homeostatic) and prospective (allostatic) modes of biological regultion, and their interaction with higher-order beliefs",

This framework accommodates a rich variety of allostatic phenomena spanning multiple timescales; ranging from deeply-entrenched, slowly-unfolding regularities (e.g., circadian and circannual rhythms) to highly unpredictable, transient events (e.g., predator–prey encounters), and everything in between (e.g., meal consumption; Morville et al. 2018 ; Teff 2011 ). Broadening the inferential horizon: preferences, policies, and plans A second, complementary perspective focuses on the ways organisms can develop complex behavioural repertoires that optimise physiological regulation in an anticpatory manner (e.g., buying food and preparing a meal before one is hungry). Active inference agents can acquire such skills by leveraging information about evolving state transitions, or policies . Policies are (beliefs about) sequences of actions (or more precisely, control states ; see Footnote 12) required to minimise free energy in the future, thereby realising some preferred (i.e. expected, self-evidencing, and thus valuable ) outcome (Attias 2003 ; Friston et al. 2012a , 2013 ; Pezzulo et al. 2018 ). In active inference, policies are explicitly evaluated (and therefore selected) 20 One might protest that all we have done here is pivot from one sort of reactive homeostatic mechnism to another; albeit, one involving responses to an external (rather than internal) threat. Neverthless, we consider this simple scenario as exemplary of the fundamental principle of allostatic regulation; namely, the modulation of physiological states in anticipation of future conditions, and in the absence of any immediate homeostatic perturbation. This example can easily be extended to capture a rich assorment of allostatic dynamics that play out across increasing levels of abstraction and spatiotemporal scale. depending on their expected free energy , i.e. the amount of free energy they are expected to minimise in the future",

It is important not to conflate this notion of expected free energy with that of variational free energy (as introduced in “ Surprise and free energy minimisation ”). The former only arises during policy evaluation and uses expectations about future states of affairs that may arise from selecting a paticular policy; whereas the latter uses (available) information about past and present states of affairs. Policy selection is important for allostatic control, because by explicitly consideing future states of affairs in addition to one’s immediate needs, agents can (learn how to) engage in relatively complex courses of action that miminise more free energy over the long-run. Consider for instance the decision to purchase ingredients from a local supermarket and return home to cook a meal, versus ordering a meal from a neighbouring fast food restaurant. In both cases, the underlying homeostatic motivation driving behaviour (i.e. increasing prediction error manifesting as intesifying hunger) is identical; the interesting question is why one does not always opt for the policy that is most likely to resolve prediction error (hunger) most rapidly. Selecting the Cook policy, which postpones the resolution of interoceptive predition errors (and thus engenders greater free energy in the short-term), might appear on first blush to contradict the free energy principle. Such choices can however be explained by recourse to the agent’s superordinate expectation to minimise expected free energy over longer timescales (e.g., prior beliefs about the health, financial, and/or social benefits associated with domestic meal preparation; cf. Friston et al. 2015b ; Pezzulo 2017 ; Pezzulo et al. 2018 ). 21 Pezzulo and colleagues ( 2015 ) offer an account of allostasis that seeks to explain the gamut of behavioural control schemes acquired via associative learning from a unified active inference perspective",

From a broader ethlogical perspective, this scheme implies a deep continuity between the homeostatic loops underpinning simple, stereotypical response behaviour on the one hand, and the complex processes supporting goal-directed decision-making and planning on the other. According to this view, all associative learning-based control schemes fall out of the same uncertainty-reducing dynamics prescribed by the free energy priciple. What distinguishes these schemes under the active inference framework is their place in the model hierarchy: While rudimentary adaptive behaviours (e.g., approach/avoidance reflexes) are availed by ‘shallow’ architectures, more sophistcated modes of control require greater degrees of hierarchical depth. Goal-directed actions require generative models that are capable of representing the prospective 21 Note that the appeal to expected free energy was also implicit in the predator example of the previous section, insofar as transient increases in homeostatic prediction error were tolerated in order to avoid a much more surprising fate—being eaten! 22 See Moore ( 2004 ) for a thoroughgoing review of such associative learning mechanisms. evolution of hidden states over sufficiently long intervals (cf. Botvinick and Tousaint 2012 ; Penny et al. 2013 ; Solway and Botvinick 2012 ), while simultaneously predicting how these projected trajectories are likely to impact upon the internal states of the organism (cf. Keramati and Gutkin 2014 ). On this account, activity at higher (or deeper) hierarchical layers (e.g., prefrontal cortical networks) contextuaises that of more primitive control schemes operating at lower levels of the hierachy (see also Pezzulo and Cisek 2016 ; Pezzulo et al. 2018 )",

This means that highelevel inferences about distal or remote states (and the policies most likely to realise them) inform lower-level mechanisms governing action over shorter timescales (see also Attias 2003 ; Badre 2008 ; Friston et al. 2016 ; Kaplan and Friston 2018 ; Pezzulo et al. 2018 ). A distinctive feature of Pezzulo and colleagues’ ( 2015 ) scheme is the crucial role played by the (crosor multimodal) integration of interoceptive, proprioceptive, and exteroceptive information over time. This is required if one wants to translate inferences on time-varying internal states (e.g., declining blood glucose concentrtion) into complex behavioural strategies (e.g., preparing a meal) that anticipate or prevent homeostatic disturbance. This is to say that the emergence of nervous sytems which enable their owners to envisage and pursue certain future states at the expense of others depends upon the (allostatic) capacity to track and anticipate cevolving internal/sensory and external/active state trajectories. 23 In short, Pezzulo and colleagues ( 2015 ) posit that hierarchical generative models harness prior experence to map sensorimotor events to interoceptive fluctuations. This mapping enables the agent to learn how their interoceptive/affective states are likely to change both endogenously (e.g., I am likely to become irritable if I forgo my morning coffee ), and in the context of external conditions (e.g., I am likely to dehydrate if I exercise in this heat without consuming fluids ). 24 With this (hierarchical) inferential architecture in place, it is relatively easy to see how allostatic policies may take root. As alluded to above, interoceptive/homeostatic dynamics often exhibit (quasi)periodic cycles, thus facilitating the modelling and prediction of time-evolving changes in internal sensory states. Given a model of how interoceptive states typically oscillate, the agent learns how particular external peturbations (including those caused by its own actions) modulate this trajectory (cf",

As the agent accrues experience, it progressively refines 23 More precisely, this capacity depends on the ability to infer the expected free energy of the outcomes associated with various potential state trajectories, as well as the expected likelihood of outcomes under each policy (see Friston et al. 2017a , c ; Parr and Friston 2017 , 2018b ). We have suggested such inferetial processes might be facilitated by the co-ordination of exteroceptive sampling and motor activity with periodic regimes of autonomic/interoceptive active inference (Corcoran et al. 2018 ). 24 We emphasise again that the conscious, reflective character of these intuitive examples should not detract from the idea that the possibility of such experiences is underwritten by more basic, unconscious allostatic mechanisms. For example, the growth onset of a horse’s winter coat is not assumed to represent a strategic decision on the part of the horse, but rather a physiological response to seasonal changes in photoperiod. Similarly, a rabbit might schedule her foraging bouts to balance energy gain against predtion risk, even though she might not be capable of representing and evaluating these concerns expliitly (this trade-off may, for instance, be implicitly encoded within the animal’s circadian rhythm—see “ Model 2: Hierarchical active inference ”). its model of the contingent relations that obtain between sensorimotor occurrences and physiological fluctuations, engendering the ability to extrapolate from senstions experienced in the past and present to those expected in the future (Friston et al. 2017a ).

This capacity is not only crucial for finessing the fundamental control problems posed by homeostasis (i.e. inferring the optimal policy for securing future survival and reproductive success), but also for its vital contribution in establishing the agent’s understanding of itself qua autonomous agent (cf. Fotopoulou and Tskiris 2017 ; Friston 2017 ). It is a relatively small step from here to the emergence of goal-directed behaviours that are ostensibly independent of (i.e. detached or decopled from) current stimuli, hence permitting anticipatory forms of biological regultion (e.g., purchasing food when one is not hungry; see Pezzulo and Castelfranchi 2009 ; Pezzulo 2017 ). Interim summary In this section, we have presented two closely-related computational perspectives on biological regulation that cast homeostasis and allostasis within the broader scheme of active inference. We believe these accounts can be productively synthesised into a comprehensive framework that explains the emergence of increasingly verstile, context-sensitive, and temporally-extended forms of allostatic regulation. This framework provides a formal account of biological regulation that eschews the coceptual limitations of setpoint invariance (see Cabanac 2006 ; Ramsay and Woods 2014 ), unifies habitual (‘model-free’) and goal-directed (‘model-based’) behaviour (Dolan and Dayan 2013 ) under a single hierarchical architecture (see Fitzgerald et al. 2014 ; Pezzulo et al. 2016 ), and converges with neurophysiologically-informed perspectives on mind–body integration (e.g., Critchley and Harrison 2013 ; Smith et al. 2017 ). We have also introduced the important notion of policy selection, which explains how adaptive behaviour emerges through (active) inference of beliefs about the future (cf. ‘planning as inference’; Attias 2003 ; Botvinick and Toussaint 2012 ; Solway and Botvinick 2012 )",

From a broader perspective, the capacity of higher model levels to track the evlution of increasingly distal, temporally-extended, and abstract hidden dynamics, and to infer the likely consequences of such dynamics for the agent’s own interity and wellbeing, provides a compelling explanation of how allostatic control schemes could have established themselves over ontogenetic and phylogenetic timscales. Not only does this perspective provide a principled account of how allostatic mechanisms should ‘know’ when to initiate adaptive compensations in the absence of physiological disturbance (i.e. how the body ‘acquires its wisdom’; Dworkin 1993 ), the embedding of such processes within an overarching hierarchical model also explains how agents are able to effectively arbitrate and trade-off multiple copeting demands (a core feature of many allostatic frameworks; e.g., Sanchez-Fibla et al. 2010 ; Sterling 2012 ; Schulkin and Sterling 2019 ; Verschure et al. 2014 ). 25 In the next section of this paper, we consider why such allostatic regimes should have evolved. Biological regulation in an uncertain world We have argued that adaptive biological activity is underwritten by active inference, where more sophisticated (predictive or prospective) forms of biological regulation are supported by increasingly more sophisticated generative models that extract and exploit long-term, patterned regularities in internal and external conditions. In this section, we take a closer look at how the functional organisation of the inferential architecture constrains the organism’s capacity to represent time-evolving state trjectories, and the impact this has upon its ability to deal with uncertainty. Our analysis draws inspiration from Peter Godfrey-Smith’s influential enviromental complexity thesis ( 1996 ), which casts cognition as an adaptation to certain complex (i.e. heterogeneous or variable) properties of the organism’s eco-niche",

On this view, cognition evolved to mitigate or ‘neutralise’ environmental complexity by means of behavioural complexity —“the ability to do a lot of different things, in diferent conditions” (Godfrey-Smith 1996 , p. 26). 26 The concept of complexity at the core of Godfrey-Smith’s analysis is deliberately broad and abstract. Environments may comprise manifold dimensions of compleity, many of which may be of no ecological relevance to their inhabitants. Patterns of variation only become biologically salient once the capacity to track and co-ordnate with them confers a selective advantage (i.e. when sensitivity to environmental variation helps the organism to solve problems—or exploit opportunities—that bear on its fitness; Godfrey-Smith 2002 ). Much like the notion of surprise (conditional entropy) introduced in “ Surprise and free energy minimisation ”, then, the implictions of environmental complexity for any given organism are determined by the latter’s constitution and relation to its niche. In what follows, we analyse the connection between environmental and behaioural complexity as mediated by increasingly elaborate schemes of active inference. Following Godfrey-Smith’s observation that complexity can be cast as “disorder, in the sense of uncertainty” ( 1996 , p. 24; see also pp. 153–154), we consider how the 25 See Morville et al. ( 2018 ) for discussion of the nontrivial challenges posed by high-dimensional homeostatic needs in uncertain environments. The ability to reliably navigate such complex demands speaks also to the notion of competence in artificial intelligence research (see Miracchi 2019 ). 26 This gloss on the environmental complexity thesis is reminiscent of W. Ross Ashby’s law of requisite variety ( 1956 , 1958 ; cf. Conant and Ashby 1970 ), and is clearly in line with recent neuroscientific inteest in the brain’s teleonomic function as a sophisticated biological regulator (for discussion, see Wiliams and Colling 2018 )",

Although Godfrey-Smith ( 1996 , pp. 76–79) briefly remarks upon the connetion between cybernetic accounts of homeostatic control and cognitive function, he rejects their strong continuity on the grounds that cognition can sustain biological viability through actions that circumvent homeostatic mechanisms. We concur that non-trivial definitions of homeostasis and cognition invoke concepts that are distinct from one another, and argue below that this distinction can be cashed out in terms of their constitutive inferential architectures. exigencies of biological regulation under conditions of uncertainty may have prmoted the evolution of increasingly more complex inferential architectures, and how such architectures enable organisms to navigate complex environments with increaing adroitness. To this end, we will consider three successive forms of generative model that may underwrite different sorts of creatures. First, we take a simple generative model— and implicit architecture for active inference—that may be suitable for explaining single-celled organisms that show elemental homoeostasis and reflexive behaviour. We then consider hierarchical generative models that have parametric depth, in the sense that they afford inference at multiple timescales (where faster dynamics at lower levels are contextualised by slower dynamics at higher levels). This produces adaptive systems that evince a deep temporal structure in their exchange with the environment by simply minimising free energy. An illustrative example of this in the active inference literature is birdsong; namely, the generation and recognition of songs that have an elemental narrative with separation of temporal scales (Kibel et al. 2008 ). We will use this hierarchical scheme to explain certain aspects of allostasis such as circadian regulation, which permits the agent to implicitly track and adapt metabolic operations to slow temporal dynamics (i.e. cycles of night and day)",

It is important to note that agents that are endowed with parametrically (but not temporally) deep models are quite limited; they can infer and adapt to future circumstances, but canot actively select which one to attend. For example, although birds can recognise particular songs of conspecifics, this form of perceptual inference does not entail actively attending to one bird or another. In other words, it does not entail a selection among ways in which to engage with the sensorium. To bring this kind of selection into the picture, one needs to evaluate the expected free energy following one or another action (e.g., attending to one bird or another). However, in order to evalate expected free energy, one has to have a generative model of the future—that is, the consequences of action. This in turn calls for generative models with temporal or counterfactual depth that are necessary to evaluate the expected free energy of a given policy. It is this minimisation of expected free energy—that converts sentient systems into agents that reflect and plan, in the sense of entertaining the counterfatual outcomes of their actions—that we associate with cognition. Model 1: Minimal active inference First, let us consider a simple example of homeostatic conservation through a ‘minmal’ active inference architecture. 27 We model this ‘creature’ on simplified aspects of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) bacteria to emphasise the generality of such schemes beyond neurally-implemented control systems. 27 See Baltieri and Buckley ( 2017 ) and McGregor et al. ( 2015 ) for alternative formulations of ‘minimal’ active inference. Our E. coli -like creature is a unicellular organism equipped with a cell membrane (i.e. a Markov blanket separating internal from external states), a metabolic patway (i.e",

Our E. coli -like creature is a unicellular organism equipped with a cell membrane (i.e. a Markov blanket separating internal from external states), a metabolic patway (i.e. an autopoietic network that harnesses thermodynamic flows to realise and replenish the organism’s constitutive components), and a sensorimotor pathway; but at the outset nothing approximating a nervous system (actual E. coli is of course much more complicated than this). Cellular metabolism depends on the agent’s ability to absorb sufficient amounts of nutrient (e.g., glucose) from its immediate environment. However, the distribution of nutrient varies across the environment, meaning the agent must seek out nutrient-rich patches in order to survive. Like real E. coli , our creature attempts to realise this goal by alternating between two chemoactic policies: Run (i.e. swim along the present course) versus Tumble (i.e. randomly reorient to a new course, commence swimming; see Fig. 1 ). Our simplified E. coli -like creature embodies a model that encodes an expecttion to inhabit a nutrient-rich milieu. Variation in the environment’s chemical prfile means that this expectation is not always satisfied—sometimes the agent finds itself in regions where chemical attractant is relatively scarce. Crucially, however, the organism can infer its progress along the nutrient gradient through periodic sapling of its chemosensory states, and acts on this information such that it tends to swim up the gradient over time. 28 This rudimentary sensorimotor control architecture affords the agent a very priitive picture of the world—one that picks out a single, salient dimension of enviromental complexity (i.e. attractant rate of change). The capacity to estimate or infer this property implies a model that prescribes a fixed expectation about the kind of milieu the agent will inhabit, while also admitting some degree of uncertainty as to whether this expectation will be satisfied at any given moment",

The task of the agent is to accumulate evidence in favour of its model by sampling from its policies in such a way that it ascends the nutrient gradient, thereby realising its expected sesory states (cf. Tschantz et al. 2019 ). Although severely limited in terms of the perceptual or representational capacties at its disposal, this need not imply suboptimality per se. Consider the case in which various kinds of attractant are compatible with the organism’s chemorecetors. The agent cannot discriminate amongst these chemical substances; all it can do is infer the presence (or absence) of ‘nutrient’ at its various receptor sites. Assuming all forms of chemical attractant are equally nutritious (i.e. equally ‘preferable’ or ‘valuable’ given the agent’s phenotype), this source of environmental heterogeneity 28 In fact, real E. coli realise a similar ‘adaptive gradient climbing’ strategy by integrating chemosensory information about the ambient chemical environment over time, and modulating the probability of tubling as a function of attractant rate of change (Berg and Brown 1972 ; Falke et al. 1997 ). More recent work has indicated that such chemotactic activity approximates optimal Kalman filtering (Andrews et al. 2006 ), where hidden states are estimated on the basis of prior and present observations weighted by their uncertainty (Kalman 1960 ; Kalman and Bucy 1961 ; see Grush 2004 , for discussion). As Kalman filtering constitutes a special case of Bayesian filtering (one that is equivalent to predictive coding; Bastos et al. 2012 ; Friston et al. 2010b , 2018 ), chemotaxis can be cast as a gradient descent on variational free energy. Notice that our model is deliberately simpler than this scheme, since sensory prediction errors are not modulated by an uncertainty (precision) parameter. turns out to be entirely irrelevant to the system’s ongoing viability",

Consequently, the extra structural and functional complexity required to distinguish these sustances would afford the organism no adaptive benefit—on the contrary, the addtional metabolic costs incurred by such apparatus might pose a hindrance. 29 Our E. coli -like creature thus trades in a rather coarse representational currency, thereby minimising the costs associated with unwarranted degrees of organistional complexity. This is an example of optimising the trade-off between model accuracy and complexity (Fitzgerald et al. 2014 ; Hobson and Friston 2012 ; Moran et al. 2014 ), where the simplest model to satisfactorily explain observed data (i.e. the presence/absence of nutrient) defeats more complex competitors (or on an evlutionary timescale, where natural selection favours the simplest model that satifices for survival and reproductive success; Campbell 2016 ; Friston 2018 ). This also explains why some creatures might have evolved simpler phenotypes from more complicated progenitors—natural selection ‘rewards efficiency’ over the long-run (McCoy 1977 ). This caveat notwithstanding, there remain a great many aspects of the enviroment that the minimal active inference agent fails to model despite their potential bearing on its wellbeing. One such omission is the system’s incapacity to represent the evolution of its states over multiple sensory samples. This limitation is signifcant, since it prevents the organism from discerning patterns of variation over time, which in turn renders it overly sensitive to minor fluctuations in prediction error. For instance, the organism might trigger its Tumble policy at the first sign of grdient descent, even though this decrement might stem from a trivial divergence in the quantity of attractant detected across sensory samples",

Unable to contextualise incoming sensory information with respect to the broader trajectory of its sensory flows, the agent risks tumbling out of a nutrient-rich stream due to innocuous or transient instability of the gradient, or due to the random error introduced by inheently noisy signalling pathways. Relatedly, the agent’s inability to retain and integrate over past experiences prcludes the construction of map-like representations of previously-explored territory. The organism thus loses valuable information about the various conditions encoutered on previous foraging runs—information that a more sophisticated creature could potentially exploit in order to extrapolate the most promising prospects for future forays. Moreover, it also lacks the necessary model parameters to track varous distal properties that modulate or covary with the distribution of attractant (e.g., weather conditions, conspecifics, etc.). The agent is thus unable to exploit the paterned regularities that obtain between proximal and distal hidden states, and that afford predictive cues about the likely consequences of pursuing a particular poicy (cf. fish species whose swim policies are informed by predictions about distal 29 The story changes if the organism’s receptors are compatible with molecules it cannot metabolise, or that afford low nutritional value (assuming such molecules are prevalent enough to significantly interfere with chemotaxis).

In sum, the agent we have described here embodies a very simple active infeence scheme; one which supports adaptive responses to an ecologically-relevant dimension of environmental complexity. While the agent does not always succeed in inferring the best chemotactic policy in a given situation, its strategy of altenating between active states in accordance with local nutrient conditions is cheap 1 2 Chemoreceptor Expectation unit Error unit Prediction Prediction error Selected policy Fig. 1 A simple active inference model of bacterial chemotaxis. This figure depicts a simple active inference agent that must sample from its sensory states in order to infer the best course of (chemotatic) action. Since the organism expects its transmembrane chemoreceptors to be occupied by attractant molecules, absence of attractant at these sites evokes prediction error (red triangles). These signals are projected (e.g., via protein pathways; red arrows) to the agent’s motor control network, where they are summed and compared to the expectation induced by the previous wave of sensory input (black circle). If the prediction error generated by current sensory input is reduced relative to that of the preceding cycle of perceptual inference, this constitutes evidence that the agent is ascending the nutrient gradient; i.e. evidence favouring the Run policy (1). Conversely, increased prediction error furnishes evidence of grdient descent, thus compelling the agent to sample from its Tumble policy (2). Here, policies are enacted via prediction errors that induce clockwise ( Tumble ) or anti-clockwise ( Run ) flagellar motion.

But the severe epistemic constraints enforced by the agent’s extremely narrow reresentational repertoire—both in the sense of its highly constricted spatiotemporal horizon, and in the poverty of its content—render this organism a creature of hazard. Unable to profit from past experience or future beliefs, it is locked in a perpetual present. This creature is thus thoroughly homeostatic in nature, activating its effetor mechanisms whenever error signals indicate deviation beyond setpoint bounds. 30 Before moving onto our next model, let us briefly consider whether a creature could exist by simply maintaining its homeostatic stability in the absence of exterceptive modelling and action. 31 When a creature of this sort encounters surprising deviations from its homeostatic expectations it only ever adjusts its internal states, never its active states. It may for instance change its metabolic rate (e.g., slow repiration, inhibit protein synthesis) in response to altered nutrient conditions, rather than acting on the environment in order to reinstate homeostatic equilibrium. 32 It is difficult to see how such a creature could actually exist in anything but a transitory, serendipitous manner. Changing its internal states in response to interceptive prediction error is tantamount to yielding entirely to uncertainty. For exaple, as the nutrient gradient declines the organism’s metabolic rate keeps decreasing, until it eventually starves to death—its states disperse throughout all possible states. An organism that fails to act upon its environment is ill-placed to avoid surprise and resist entropy.

From an active inference perspective, this creture is the embodiment of pure perception; i.e. an organism that reconfigures its internal states (updates its model) in accordance with external conditions, without ever seeking to alter such conditions (cf. Brineberg et al. 2018 ; Corcoran 2019 ). 33 One might play with the idea of entities that could exist like this quite happily once the ideal, invariant niche is discovered—perhaps deep within rocky crevices or underwater (one is reminded of the sea squirt that consumes its own brain after settling upon a permanent home, but the anecdote turns out to be an exaggeration; see Mackie and Burighel 2005 ). However, entities of this sort would surely fail to qualify as adaptive biological systems—at least insofar as the notion of adaptability implies some capacity to maintain one’s viability in the face of time-varying environmental dynamics (cf. ‘mere’ vs. ‘adaptive’ active inference; Kirchhoff et al. 2018 ). Moreover, such entities would also fail to qualify as agents in any biologically relevant sense (see for e.g., Moreno and Etxeberria 2005 ).

The thrust of this argument is that free energy minimisation should compel agents to seek out the least-surprising environments possible (e.g., a room devoid of stimulation) and stay there until perishing. Various rejoinders to this charge have been made (see for e.g., Clark 2018 ; Hohwy 2013 ; Schwartenbeck et al. 2013 ), including the observation that this strategy will inevitably lead to increasing free energy on account of accumulating interoceptive prdiction error (Corcoran 2019 ; Pezzulo et al. 2015 ). More technically, “itinerant dynamics in the enviroment preclude simple solutions to avoiding surprise” (Friston et al. 2009 , p. 2), where the environment referred to here includes the biophysical conditions that obtain within the organism, as well as without. Model 2: Hierarchical active inference Next, let us consider a more elaborate version of our creature, now equipped with a more sophisticated, hierarchical generative model of its environment—one which captures how environmental dynamics unfold over multiple timescales. Because higher levels of the generative model subtend increasingly broad temporal scales (Friston et al. 2017d ; Kiebel et al. 2008 ), we shall see that this creature is capable of inferring the causes of slower fluctuations in the nutrient gradient. An implication of this arrangement is the emergence of parameters encoding higher-order expectations about the content and variability of sensory flows over time (cf. the fixed expecttion of a high-nutrient state in Model 1). In the interests of tractability, we limit ourselves to a fairly schematic illustrtion of hierarchical active inference in the context of circadian regulation.

Circadian processes are near ubiquitous features of biological systems (even bacteria like E. coli show evidence of circadian rhythmicity; Wen et al. 2015 ), and provide a usful example of how internal dynamics can be harnessed to anticipate environmental variability. Circadian clocks are endogenous, self-sustaining timing mechanisms that enable organisms to co-ordinate a host of metabolic processes over an approximately 24 h period (Bailey et al. 2014 ; Dyar et al. 2018 ). From an allostatic perspective, cicadian oscillations furnish a temporal frame of reference enabling the organism to anticipate (and efficiently prepare for) patterned changes in ecologically-relevant variables (e.g., diurnal cycles of light and temperature variation). 34 We can incorprate a molecular clock within our active inference agent by installing oscillatory prtein pathways within its metabolic network (Nakajima et al. 2005 ; Rust et al. 2007 ; Zwicker et al. 2010 ). With this timing mechanism in place, our creature may begin to track systematic variations in the temporal dynamics of its internal and sensory states. Suppose our organism exists in a medium that becomes increasingly viscous as temperature declines overnight. The impact of these environmental fluctuations is two-fold: Colder ambient temperatures cool the organism, slowing its metbolic rate; greater viscosity increases the medium’s resistance, making chemotaxis more energy-intensive. Initially, the agent might interpret unexpectedly high rates of energy expenditure as indicative of suboptimal chemotaxis, thus compelling it Footnote 33 (continued) This is to say that the attractors around which adaptive biological systems self-organise are inherently unstable—both autopoietic (‘self-creating’) and autovitiating (‘self-destroying’)—thus inducing itinerant trajectories ( heteroclinic cycles ) through state-space (Friston 2011 , 2012b ; Friston and Ao 2012 ; Friston et al. 2012c )",

In other words, dark rooms may very well appeal to creatures like us (e.g., as homeostatic sleep presure peaks towards the end of the day), but the value such environments afford will inevitably decay as alternative possibilities (e.g., leaving the room to find breakfast after a good night’s sleep) become more salient and attractive (cf. alliesthesia , the modulation of affective and motivational states according to (time-evolving) physiological conditions; Berridge 2004 ; Cabanac 1971 ). 34 Note that the allostatic treatment of circadian regulation may in principle be extended to periodic phnomena spanning shorter or longer timescales; e.g., ultradian and circannual rhythms. to sample its Tumble policy more frequently in an effort to discover a nutrient-rich patch. Over time, however, the agent may come to associate a particular phase of its circadian cycle with higher average energy expenditure irrespective of policy seletion. Our creature can capitalise on this information by scheduling its more expesive metabolic operations to coincide with warmer times of day, while restricting its nocturnal activity to a few essential chemical reactions. In other words, the agent can reorganise its behaviour (i.e. develop a rudimentary sleep/wake cycle) in order to improve its fit with its environment. 35 This scenario is indicative of how a relatively simple hierarchical agent may come to model time-varying hidden states in the distal environment. Like its minmal active inference counterpart, the hierarchical agent registers fluctuations in its sensory and internal states, and responds to them appropriately given its available policies. Unlike the minimal agent, however, these rapid fluctuations are theselves subject to second-order processing, in which successive sensory samples are integrated under a probabilistic representation of first-order variation (see Fig. 2 )",

The ability to contextualise faster fluctuations in relation to the slower oscillatory dynamics of the circadian timekeeper enables the agent to infer that it is subject to periodic environmental perturbations, the origin of which can be parsimoniously ascribed to some unitary external process. 36 This example hints at a central tenet of the active inference scheme; namely, that the hierarchical organisation of the genertive model implies a hierarchy of temporal scales, where causal dynamics subtening larger timeframes are encoded at higher levels of the model (Friston 2008 ; Friton et al. 2017d ; Kiebel et al. 2008 ). The hierarchical picture we have sketched here speaks to two complementary aspects of representational detachment (cf. Gärdenfors 1995 ; Pezzulo and Castelranchi 2007 ; Pezzulo 2008 ) engendered by allostatic architectures. First, the separtion of processing layers within the model hierarchy gives rise to a kind of temporal decoupling, in which higher layers construct extended representations of low-level sensory states. Although it might be tempting to think of these representations as aggregates of successive sensory samples, this does not do justice to the sophistcated nature of perception under active inference. Rather, higher layers of the hiearchy are perpetually engaged in modelling the evolution of the organism’s sensory and internal states, and thus inferring the probable motion of the distal causes of its sensory flows. Consequently, higher-order representations ‘reach out’ beyond 35 This scenario is not meant to imply that circadian rhythms are actually acquired in this fashion (although they are clearly susceptible to modulation through external cues). Rather, the idea we are tring to illustrate here is the way hierarchical architectures ground adaptive regulation over longer timscales by dint of their capacity to capture recurrent, slowly evolving patterns of environmental variation",

It might not be right to say the agent represents ambient temperature per se, nor indeed the higher-order causes of the latter’s oscillation (sun exposure, planetary rotation, etc.). Our agent lacks sufficient hierarchical depth to arrive at such conclusions, collapsing these fine-grained distinctions into a fairly ‘flat’, undifferentiated representation of diurnal variation. the limits of each sensory moment, extrapolating forwards and backwards in time to synthesise an expanded temporal horizon (see Fig. 2 a). Second, there is a related sense in which higher-level processing within the hiearchy realises a more negative or reductive kind of detachment from low-level sesory input. Higher-level representations do not merely recapitulate (and predict) the bare contents of sensory experience, but seek instead to extract patterned continuties amidst the flux of sensory stimulation. This is to say that higher levels of the model attempt to carve out biologically-relevant signals within the agent’s enviroment, while dampening or discarding the remaining content of sensory flows. This again speaks to the tension between model accuracy and complexity: Good models capture real patterns of environmental complexity, without being overly sensitive to the data at hand (and thus at risk of accruing prediction error over the long-run; Hohwy 2017b ). If this account is on the right track, the generative model can be construed as a kind of (Bayesian) filter (Friston et al. 2010b ) that strips sensory signals of their higher-frequency components as they are passed up the hierarchy",

In conjunction with the ‘horizontal’ temporal processing described above (which can likewise be understood in terms of noncausal filtering or smoothing, where past and future state estimates are updated in light of novel sensory data; Friston et al. 2017a ), this ‘vertcal’ filtering scheme enables the organism to form reliable higher-order representtions of the slowly-evolving statistical regularities underlying rapid sensory fluctutions. The organism is thus able to model the slow oscillatory dynamics embedded within the distal structure of its eco-niche (e.g., the diurnal temperature cycle), even though the particular sensory states through which these dynamics are accessed may vary considerably over time (e.g., temperature variation may be modulated by multple interacting factors subtending multiple timescales—momentary occlusion of the sun, daily and seasonal weather cycles, climate change, etc.). These dual facets of representational detachment help to explain not only how the hierarchical agent learns about invariant properties of an ever-changing envronment, but also how it can exploit such regularities to its advantage. Circadian rhythms offer a particularly good example of how abstract representations of oscilatory dynamics foster adaptive behaviour in the context of environmental uncetainty. 37 Given a reliable model of how certain environmental properties are likely to evolve, the agent can form allostatic predictions that enable it to act in preparation for impending conditions, even if such expectations run contrary to current sensory evidence. An interesting corollary of this view is the role of allostatic representations (e.g., circadian templates or programmes of activity) in compelling the agent to act ‘as if’ particular states of affairs obtain. Under certain conditions, such allostatic prdictions amount to a kind of false inference about the hidden states that are curently in play",

Returning to our earlier example, let us imagine that the hierarchical agent leerages its internal representation of diurnal temperature variation to schedule its activities to coincide with favourable environmental conditions. For instance, the organism might preemptively downregulate metabolic activity in preparation for nocturnal quiescence, irrespective of whether the ambient temperature has declined to an extent that would impair its metabolic efficiency.

This function oscillates slowly as detected nutrient levels remain more or less stable over time, each incoming ‘packet’ of sensory information smoothly integrated within the broader temporal horizon of predicted and postdicted sensory states. The function begins to oscillate more rapidly when the organism experiences marked deviations from its expected states (right panels). This sudden volley of prediction error precipitates an increase in the precision on first-order prediction errors, enhancing the agent’s perceptual sensitivity to environmental fluctuations. Increasing variability of sensory input also induces greater uncertainty about the trajectory of sensory states (as reflected in the broadening blue shading). b Schematic of a possible implementation of the hierarchical active inference scheme depicted in A. Sensory input from chemoreceptors (green hexagons) is received at the first prcessing level and compared to sensory expectations (black circles). Discrepancies between expected and actual input generate prediction errors (red triangles), which are passed up the hierarchy to the second processing level. Crucially, these prediction errors are modulated by precision estimates (blue square), which determine the ‘gain’ or influence ascribed to error signals (where high gain compels expectation units to conform with prevailing sensory evidence). Expected precision over first-order prediction errors is modulated in turn by second-order prediction error, which increases the gain on first-order errors. See Kanai et al. ( 2015 ), Parr and Friston ( 2018a ), and Shipp ( 2016 ) for more detailed discussion of how such hierarchical schemes might be implemented in the brain.

On first blush, this arrangement might seem suboptimal—surely the agent would be better off tuning its behaviour to actual environmental conditions, rather than relying on error-prone predictions? However, this would simply return us to the kind of closed-loop architecture of the minimal active inference agent; a creature incapble of distinguishing a genuine change in distal conditions from a transient deviation in its sensory states. In this sense our agent’s circadian gambit constitutes a more intelligent mode of regulation—armed with implicit knowledge of how state trajetories tend to evolve, the organism acts on the assumption that the future will roughly approximate the past, and treats transient deviations from this prescribed pattern as mere noise (i.e. the inherent uncertainty associated with stochastic processes). Hence, although circadian rhythms might not guarantee ideal behaviour on shorter timescales, their adaptive value inheres in their ability to approximate the trajectory of homeostatically-relevant states over time. Such allostatic represetations provide useful heuristics for guiding action—behaving in accordance with circadian predictions keeps the agent within the vicinity of its attracting set, thus affording a highly efficient means of reducing average uncertainty. Representations of this sort are insensitive to short-term fluctuations precisely because such transient dynamics (e.g., an unseasonably cold morning) are unlikely to afford information that improves its capacity to accurately predict future states. Circadian rhythms are therefore ‘robust’ to outlying or stochastic fluctuations in sensory data, thus consttuting a reliable model of the underlying generative process",

Circadian rhythms are therefore ‘robust’ to outlying or stochastic fluctuations in sensory data, thus consttuting a reliable model of the underlying generative process. 38 In contrast to the minimal active inference agent, the hierarchical organism can exploit regularities in its environment to predict when and where it will be best placed to act, rather than responding reflexively to online sensory updates. Yet, while deep hierarchical architectures afford substantial advantages over the minimal scheme of Model 1, their capacity to reduce uncertainty through parameter estimtion is most effective in a relatively stable world. Sudden alterations in environmetal conditions (e.g., exchanging the European winter for the Australasian summer) require relatively long periods of reparameterisation, and may engender suboptimal, surprise-accruing behaviour in the interim. Flexible adaptation to novel (or rapidlchanging) situations requires generative models endowed with a temporal depth that transcends the hierarchical separation of fast and slow dynamics. We discuss such models next. 38 The remarkable robustness of circadian oscillations is thrown into relief whenever one traverses seeral time-zones—a good example of how strongly-held (i.e. high-precision or ‘stubborn’; see Yon et al. 2019 ) allostatic expectations persist in the face of contradictory sensory evidence (i.e. the phase-shifted photoperiod and feeding schedule, to which the system eventually recalibrates; Asher and Sassone-Corsi 2015 ; Menaker et al. 2013 ). Model 3: Counterfactual active inference Our final model describes a biological agent equipped with a temporally deep model, which furnishes the ability to explicitly predict and evaluate the consequences of its policies. While this kind of generative model is undoubtedly the most complex and sophisticated of our three active inference schemes, it is also the most powerful, insofar as it allows the agent to perform counterfactual active inference",

Our understanding of subjunctive processing draws on the Stalnaker-Lewis analysis of counterfactual conditionals, where the truth-conditions of a consequent are determined in relation to the possible world invoked by its antecedent (Lewis 1973b ; Stalnaker 1968 , see also Nute 1975 ; Sprigge 1970 ; Todd 1964 ). 40 In the context of active inference, counterfactual processing translates to the simulation of those sensory states that the organism would observe if it were to enact a certain policy under a particular set of model parameters (i.e. a possible world). Our formulation of counterfactual inference implies two complementary prcesses, which we briefly introduce here. The first of these involves counterfactual inference on policies under spatiotemporally distal conditions. For example, the agent could reflect on a previous decision that precipitated a negative outcome, and consider how events might have unfolded differently (for better or worse) had it selected an alternative course of action (i.e. ‘retrospective’ inference). Similarly, the agent could envisage a scenario that it might encounter in the future, and imagine how various policies might play out under these circumstances (i.e. ‘prospective’ inference). This kind of counterfactual processing is useful for resolving uncertainty over the outcomes expected under various policies, and is integral to many sophistcated forms of cognitive processing (e.g., causal induction, mental time travel, midreading, etc.; Buckner and Carroll 2007 ; Pezzulo et al. 2017 ; Schacter and Addis 2007 ; Suddendorf and Corballis 1997 , 2007 )",

The second kind of uncertainty reduction mediated by counterfactual processing pertains to the arbitration of policies when the state of the world is itself ambiguous. This situation may arise due to uncertainty about the context that currently obtains (or relatedly, uncertainty over the consequences of policies within a particular cotext), or because the inhabited niche is inherently volatile (i.e. prone to fluctuate in ways that are relevant for the organism’s wellbeing, yet difficult to anticipate). Under such circumstances, counterfactual hypotheses may prove useful in two ways: (1) they may enable the agent to infer the policy that minimises (average) uncertainty 39 For further discussion of counterfactual representation under predictive processing, see Clark ( 2016 , Ch. 3), Friston et al. ( 2012b ), Friston ( 2018 ), Palmer et al. ( 2015 ), Pezzulo et al. ( 2015 ) and Seth ( 2014 , 2015 ). 40 Note that our use of counterfactual semantics here is not intended to imply that cognition bears any necessary resemblance to linguistic processing; it is simply adopted as a convenient way of characteriing the logic of model selection under active inference. across a variety of possible worlds; (2) they may point towards ‘epistemic’ actions that help to disambiguate the actual state of the world (i.e. disclose the likelihood mapping that currently obtains), thus improving precision over policies. As a brief illustration of counterfactual inference, let us consider an iteration of our E. coli -like creature that can evaluate the outcomes of its policies across seeral possible worlds. An organism sensitive to incident light could for instance run a counterfactual simulation for a possible world in which there is much scattered sunlight, and compare this to an alternative world featuring relatively little sunlight",

If it can order these possible worlds on the basis of their similarity to the actual world, then these counterfactual simulations could prove informative about the best action to take in a particular situation. 41 Should the sun-dappled world turn out more similar to the actual world, then the organism would do well to confine its foraging activity to shady regions of the environment. The agent might consequently adapt its policies such that it tolerates gradient descent in the context of low incident light, only risking the Tumble policy when the nutrient supply is critically depleted. Counterfactual processing enriches the generative model greatly, relative to the hierarchical organisation described in the previous section. Now there is wholly detached generative modelling of fine-grained elements of the prediction error lanscape through simulated action; there is (Bayesian) model selection in terms of the best policy (i.e. minimising the free energy between the nutrient gradient simulated under a policy and the organism’s expected nutrient gradient; cf. Fitzgerald et al. 2014 ; Friston et al. 2016 , 2017b ; Parr and Friston 2018b ); and there is processing that orders possible worlds (i.e. hypotheses entailed under competing model paraeterisations) according to their comparative similarity to the actual world (where similarity may be cashed out in terms of representations of law-like relations (e.g., between nutrient gradient and sunlight) and particular matters of fact (e.g., amount of nutrient and sunlight); cf. Lewis 1973a , b , 1979 ). This contrasts sharply with the hierarchical agent, whose representational states are never completely detached from the content of its sensory flows, and whose active states are modulated gradually in response to reliable patterns of covariation",

This is important for our analysis because the expected free energy of a policy can be decomposed into two terms—expected complexity and expected accuracy—which can be regarded as two kinds of uncetainty: risk and ambiguity (Friston et al. 2017a , b , d ). 42 Technically, risk constitutes 41 Interestingly, recent psychological evidence suggests that counterfactual scenarios deemed more simlar to previously experienced events are perceived as more plausible and easier to envisage (i.e. simlate) than more distant alternatives (Stanley et al. 2017 ). This observation lends weight to the idea that humans evaluate competing counterfactual predictions in accordance with their proximity to actual states of affairs, where proximity or similarity might be cashed out in terms of (Bayesian) model evidence (see Fitzgerald et al. 2014 ). 42 Risk and ambiguity are also known as irreducible uncertainty and (parameter) estimation uncertainty, respectively (de Berker et al. 2016 ; Payzan-LeNestour and Bossaerts 2011 ). Note that uncertainty can be a relative uncertainty (i.e. entropy) about predicted outcomes, relative to preferred outcomes, whereas ambiguity is a conditional uncertainty (i.e. entropy) about oucomes given their causes. More intuitively, risk can be understood as the probability of gaining some reward (e.g., finding a cookie) as a consequence of some action (e.g., reaching into a cookie jar), while ambiguity pertains to the fact that an obsevation might have come about in a variety of different ways (e.g., the cookie in my hand might have been given to me, stolen from the jar, etc.). 43 Counterfactual active inference agents need to consider both of these sources of uncertainty during policy selection. This is because resolving ambiguity will increase the agent’s confidence about the process(es) responsible for generating observations, enabling it to calclate the risk (i.e",

This is because resolving ambiguity will increase the agent’s confidence about the process(es) responsible for generating observations, enabling it to calclate the risk (i.e. expected cost) associated with alternative courses of action. With counterfactual inference at its disposal, the organism is potentially even better equipped to meet the demands of a complex and capricious environment. 44 Rather than engaging ‘hard-wired’ responses to current states (cf. Model 1), or ‘sofwired’ responses to anticipated states (cf. Model 2), it can exploit offline computtion of the likely consequences of different policies under various hypothetical coditions (Gärdenfors 1995 ; Grush 2004 ; Pezzulo 2008 ). This affords the opportunity to generate and test a wide variety of policies in the safety of its imagination, where actions that turn out to be too risky (or downright stupid) can be safely trialed and (hopefully) rejected (cf. Craik 1943 , p. 61; Dennett 1995 , pp. 375–376; GodfreSmith 1996 , pp. 105–106). This capacity (or competence , see Williams 2018 ) to diengage from the present and undertake such ‘thought experiments’ confers a poerful mechanism for innovation, problem-solving, and (vicarious) learning—major 43 This characterisation of risk and ambiguity is broadly consistent with descriptions in economics (e.g., Camerer and Weber 1992 ; Ellsberg 1961 ; Kahneman and Tversky 1979 ; Knight 1921 ) and neuroscience (e.g., Daw et al. 2005 ; Hsu et al. 2005 ; Huettel et al. 2006 ; Levy et al. 2010 ; Payzan-LeNestour and Bossaerts 2011 ; Preuschoff et al. 2008 ; for a review, see Bach and Dolan 2012 ). Importantly, these two sorts of uncertainty rest upon the precision (inverse variability) of the likelihood mapping between oucomes and hidden states—and transitions amongst hidden states that may or may not be under the creture’s control. Technically, the first sort of precision relates to observation noise, while the second relates to system or state noise, i.e. volatility",

Note that the term volatility is used diffeently in various contexts (see for e.g., Behrens et al. 2007 ; Bland and Schaefer 2012 ; Mathys et al. 2014 ). 44 One caveat to this claim is that the (neuro)physiological mechanisms and cognitive operations required to enrich and exploit counterfactual predictive models may themselves engender additional costs (e.g., planning a new course of action requires time, energy, and effort; see Zénon et al. 2018 ). We assume that the costs incurred by such processes ‘pay for themselves’ over the long-run (or at least tend to on average), insofar as they enable the agent to exploit prior experience in ways that are conducive to adaptive behaviour (see Buzsáki et al. 2014 ; Pezzulo 2014 ; Pezzulo et al. 2017 ; Suddendorf et al. 2018 ). It is also worth pointing out that some of the costs engendered by counterfactual inference-supporting architectures may be mitigated by a variety of adaptive strategies (e.g., model updating during sleep, habitisation of behaviour under stable and predictable conditions; see Fitzgerald et al. 2014 ; Friston et al. 2017b ; Hobson and Friston 2012 ; Pezzulo et al. 2016 ). decomposed in various other ways, depending on the domain of interest (see for e.g., Bland and Schaefer 2012 ; Bradley and Drechsler 2014 ; Kozyreva and Hertwig 2019 ).

The counterfactual active inference scheme described here implies additional degrees of organismic complexity that can be exploited to mitigate the impact of environmental uncertainty. The counterfactual agent is not only capable of ‘expecing the unexpected’ (inasmuch as it can countenance states of affairs that are unlikely under its current model of reality), but can prepare for it too—exploiting counterfactual hypotheses to formulate strategies for solving novel problems that might arise in the future (e.g., deciding what one should do in the event of sustaiing a puncture while cycling to work). Moreover, the agent may organise its policy sets in ways that are sensitive to outcome contingencies, such that it can choose a backup policy if its initial plan is thwarted (e.g., being prepared to order the apple pie if the tiramisu has sold out). This ability to deftly switch between a subset of low-risk policies may confer a huge advantage under changing (or volatile) enviromental conditions, where the time and effort required to re-evaluate a large array of policies from scratch could prove extremely costly. Counterfactual processing is also valuable when the system is confronted with a sudden or sustained volley of prediction error. The counterfactual agent is able to interpret such signals as evidence that the hidden dynamics underwriting its sensory flows may have changed in some significant way (e.g., finding oneself confronted by oncoming traffic), and can draw on alternative possible models to evaluate which parameterisation affords the best explanation for the data at hand (cf. parameter exploration ; Schwartenbeck et al. 2019 )",

If the contingent relations structuring reevant environmental properties have indeed altered (e.g., realising one is visiting a country where people drive on the opposite side of the road), the agent will need to update its model so as to capture these novel conditions (see Sales et al. 2019 ). Faiure to do so runs the risk of accruing further prediction error, since persisting with policies predicated on inaccurate (i.e. ‘out-of-date’) likelihood mappings may yield highly surprising outcomes. One way to assess whether conditions or contexts have indeed changed is to engage in epistemic action , the final feature of counterfactual active inference we address here. Epistemic actions are active states that are sampled in order to acquire information about environmental contingencies (Friston et al. 2015b , 2016 , 2017a , d ). 45 When faced with the problem of identifying which model best captures the causal structure of the world, the agent can run simulations to infer the sensory flows each model predicts under a certain policy. The agent can then put these hypoteses to the test by sampling actions designed to arbitrate amongst competing prdictions (Seth 2015 ). If the agent selects actions that are high in epistemic value , it 45 For the purposes of this brief discussion, we limit the scope of epistemic action to instances where the organism actively intervenes on its environment in order to resolve uncertainty. It is worth noting, however, that the concept can also refer to mental actions or cognitive operations that reduce uncertainty (see for e.g., Metzinger 2017 ; Pezzulo et al. 2016 ; Pezzulo 2017 ). On this broader understanding, one might construe the different varieties of counterfactual processing described above as covert modes of epistemic action. will observe outcomes that afford decisive evidence in favour of the model that best captures the current environmental regime",

The possibility of resolving ambiguity over the parameterisation of state–oucome contingencies through counterfactually-guided epistemic action also extends to ambiguity over policies. Here, the agent may run counterfactual simulations to infer actions that are likely to harvest information that clarifies the best policy to pursue. 46 These epistemic capabilities recapitulate the point that the policies of the counterfactual agent are not only scored with respect to risk-reduction or expected value (i.e. the extent to which they are expected to realise a preferred outcome), but also with respect to ambiguity-reduction or epistemic value (i.e. the extent to which they are expected to produce an informative outcome). Such epistemic actions are unavailable to the (merely) hierarchical agent, who can only reduce uncertainty over model parameters by slowly tuning its estimates to capture stable, enduring patterns of variation. 47 Two options for cognition We began this paper with the lofty ambition of learning something about the nature and function of cognition, but have for the most part been careful to eschew talk of the cognitive or the mental. In this final section, we sketch out some of the broader implications of our analysis for the concept of biological cognition, and how the later might be delimited from more general notions of life and adaptive plasticity. As a precursory step, let us begin by considering how the three schematic models described in “ Biological regulation in an uncertain world ” might relate to real bilogical agents. One obvious strategy would be to map these architectures onto diffeent taxonomic classes. For instance, one might construe the difference between these models as approximating the difference between relatively primitive organisms (like E",

For instance, one might construe the difference between these models as approximating the difference between relatively primitive organisms (like E. coli and other unicellular organisms), creatures with some degree of hierarchical depth (like reptiles or fish), and animals that demonstrate evidence of counterfactual sensitivity (like rodents; e.g., Redish 2016 ; Steiner and Redish 2014 ; Sweis et al. 2018 ; corvids; e.g., Bugnyar et al. 2016 ; Kabadayi and Osvath 2017 ; Raby et al. 2007 ; and primates; e.g., Abe and Lee 2011 ; Krupenye et al. 2016 ; Lee et al. 2005 ). 46 Such activity is sometimes referred to as epistemic foraging , where the agent seeks out information about the way state transitions are likely to unfold (Friston et al. 2017d ; Mirza et al. 2016 ; Parr and Friton 2017 ). For a nice example of epistemic foraging in wild dolphins, see Arranz et al. ( 2018 ). 47 It is interesting to remark how epistmic action contributes to the practical utility of cognition as understood under the environmental complexity thesis. Following Dewey ( 1929 ), Godfrey-Smith ( 1996 , pp. 116–120) notes that cognition is most likely to be useful in environments that comprise a mixture of regularity and unpredictability. Specifically, distal states should vary in ways that are a priori unpredicable (but worth knowing about), while maintaining a stable relationship with proximal states (see also Dunlap and Stephens 2016 ). The capacity to engage in epistemic action enhances the potential utility of cognition precisely insofar as it helps the agent to reduce uncertainty over this mapping, thus affording more precise knowledge (or novel insight; Friston et al. 2017b ) about the state of the world and its posible alternatives.

Bacteria like E. coli integrate information over a variety of sensory channels, modulate their metabolic and cheotactic activity in response to reliable environmental contingencies, and alternate policy preferences in a context-sensitive fashion (Ben-Jacob 2009 ; Freddolino and Tavazoie 2012 ; Hennessey et al. 1979 ; Mitchell et al. 2009 ; Salman and Libchaber 2007 ; Tagkopoulos et al. 2008 ; Tang and Marshall 2018 ; see also van de Cruys 2017 , for discussion from a predictive processing perspective). Although this does not rule out the possible existence of minimal active inference agents, it might sugest that all extant lifeforms instantiate some form of allostatic architecture. This raises the question of whether meaningful distinctions can be drawn in terms of hiearchical organisation (e.g. shallow vs. deep hierarchies), and whether such distintions can be systematically mapped to particular functional profiles (e.g., capacities for learning and adaptive flexibility). It might also be tempting to think of our model organisms as exemplifying cretures that are more or less evolved or adapted to their environment. Undoubtedly, the counterfactual agent comprises a more complex information-processing architecture than its minimal active inference counterpart, one equipped with a much greater capacity for flexible, selective adaptation to the vicissitudes wrought by uncertainty. However, we must be careful not to conflate adaptation to a specific set of envronmental properties with adaptation to environmental complexity per se. On both the environmental complexity thesis and the free energy principle, organisms are adapted to their environments to the extent that they successfully track and neutraise ecologically - relevant sources of uncertainty (cf. ‘frugal’ generative models; Batieri and Buckley 2017 ; Clark 2015 )",

This means that organisms comprising radcally divergent degrees of functional complexity can in principle constitute equally good models of the same environment, assuming they are equally capable of acting in ways that minimise the conditional entropy over their sensory states. Finally, given that the free energy principle conceives of all biological agents as being engaged in the same essential activity (i.e. the singular project of minimising free energy, maximising self-evidence, and thus conserving self-organisation over time), one might question whether there really are any substantive differences to be found between the levels of our three-tiered scheme. In conjunction with the argment presented in the previous paragraph, it might seem that these architectures difer from one another in a fairly superficial way: They simply illustrate alternative solutions to the fundamental problem of uncertainty reduction over time. This point notwithstanding, we believe that the distinct functional capacities we have ascribed to these models carry important implications about the origins and limits of cognition. The fact that all three architectures are afforded equal footing by the free energy principle does not speak against this view—despite its neuroscietific origins (Friston 2002 , 2003 , 2005 ), the free energy principle makes no explantory commitments to cognition per se; it simply imposes certain formal constraints on the sort of functional organisation a cognitive system must realise in order to resist entropy. This marks a significant distinction from the environmental compleity thesis, which on Godfrey-Smith’s telling limits its explanatory scope to the suset of living organisms that count as cognitive agents.

This would mean that only those biological systems capable of engaging in fully detached modes of representation, and of exploiting such representations for the purposes of uncertainty reduction, count as cognitive agents. 49 Associating cognition with counterfactual active inference might strike some as unduly restrictive, limiting category membership to humans and only the most inteligent of mammals and birds (for instance). It is important to bear in mind, however, that our construal of counterfactual processing is a formal one; many kinds of anmals are likely to exploit counterfactual inferences in ways that enable them to learn about the world and make sensible (uncertainty-reducing) decisions. Some of these processing architectures might turn out to be highly impoverished compared to the rich counterfactual capacities at our own disposal (cf. Carruthers 2004 ), but we cosider this difference a matter of degree, not kind. Notably, our counterfactual criterion does not exclude such organisms as bactria, protists, and plants from the cognitive domain by fiat .

This view inherits from Maturana’s canonical account of autopoiesis, where one finds the strongest expression of life–mind continuity: “Living systems are cognitive systems, and living as a process is a process of cognition” (Maturana and Varela 1980 , p. 13, emphasis added; see also Heschl 1990 ). 49 It is perhaps worth noting that other scholars have used the criterion of “detachment” (or “decouplbility”) to distinguish representational versus non-representational agents, rather than cognitive versus non-cognitive agents (cf. Clark and Grush 1999 ; Grush 2004 ).

An alternative (and increasingly popular) approach would be to ascribe some form of ‘minimal’ or ‘proto-cognitive’ status to bacteria, plants, and other aneural organisms (Ben-Jacob 2009 ; Calvo Garzón and Keijzer 2011 ; Gagliano 2015 ; Gofrey-Smith 2016a , b ; Lyon 2015 , 2019 ; Segundo-Ortin and Calvo 2019 ; Smith-Feguson and Beekman 2019 ; van Duijn et al. 2006 ; for a dissenting view, see Adams 2018 ). Such terms might seem appealing in light of the mounting body of research claiming that many ‘simple’ organisms engage in primitive or precursory forms of cognitive activity (Baluška and Levin 2016 ; Levin et al. 2017 ; Tang and Marshall 2018 ). Granting such cases do indeed demonstrate genuine instances of learning, memory, decision-making, and so on, it seems only the staunchest of neuro-chauviists would persist in denying the cognitive status of such organisms. While we cannot do justice to this complex topic here, a few remarks are in order. First, we should acknowledge that there may be few substantive differences between the kinds of organisms we designate as hierarchical or allostatic agents, and the bilogical systems Godfrey-Smith and others would identify as exhibiting ‘minimal’ or ‘proto-cognitive’ capacities (e.g., Godfrey-Smith 2002 , 2016b ). 50 Both categries imply systems that track relevant states in their (internal and external) enviroments, and exploit this information to adaptively regulate their activity.

Both categries also imply some form of evolutionary precedence over ‘fully-fledged’ cognitive agents—cognition ‘proper’ builds on the foundations laid by allostatic/proto-cogntive architectures. The problem with such terminology is that it implies the ascription of some form of cognitive capacity, while remaining opaque as to its precise relation to ‘fulblown’ cognition—including the reason for its segregation from the latter (see Lyon 2019 , for an extended critique). Is there some fundamental cognitive ingredient that proto-cognition lacks, or is it simply a scaled-down, severely degraded version of (say) animal cognition? If the latter, is the distinction between protand ‘genuine’ cognition marked by a critical boundary, or is the difference gradual and indetermnate? Godfrey-Smith explicitly endorses some variety of the latter view, frequently remarking that cognition ‘shades-off’ into other biological processes. But if protcognitive organisms ultimately fail to qualify as cognitive agents, 51 such talk may obscure a fundamental dis continuity. We take it that the capacity for counterfactual processing marks the subtle but significant functional boundary hinted at in Godfrey-Smith’s analysis. This proposal is—in most cases—stricter than other criteria often mentioned in the debate about minimal cognition: it implies that organisms that only engage in allostatic regulation (sometimes requiring forms of learning, memory, and decision-making) would not 50 ‘Minimal cognition’ is perhaps more closely associated with a rather different set of philosophical views than those espoused by Godfrey-Smith (e.g., anti-representationalism, situated and embodied conition; Barandiaran and Moreno 2006 ; Beer 2003 ; van Duijn et al. 2006 ). We take the main thrust of our argument to be equally applicable to these positions. 51 When pressed, Godfrey-Smith seems to hold this view: “I do not claim that bacteria exhibit cognition; this is at most a case of proto-cognition” ( 2002 , p. 223, emphasis added)",

Of course, testing which organisms meet this counterfactual criterion remains an important conceptual and empirical challenge. In this respect, our proposed definition is not neuro-chauvinistic, but is focussed rather on a functional (computationally-grounded) definition of cognition that can be met—at least in principle—by many different kinds of organisms. On this view, a minimally cognitive agent is a minimally counterfactual agent—an organism that not only learns about itself and its environment, but imagines them anew. If we are wrong, and sophisticated forms of cognitive activity simply emerge as allostatic prcessing schemes become increasingly more powerful and hierarchically elaborate, then a single dimension along which cognition ‘shades off’ into primitive forms of sensorimotor control and metabolic regulation would seem the better option.

The former uses a probabilistic (Bayesian) formulation of perception and action, while the latter calls on multiple (Pavlovian, habitual, goal-directed) processes for homeostatic and behavioural control. We offer a synthesis these classical processes and cast them as successive hierarchical contextualisations of sensorimotor constructs, using the generative models that underpin Active Inference. This dissolves any apparent mechanistic distinction between the optimization processes that mediate classical control or learning. Furthermore, we generalize the scope of Active Inference by emphasizing interoceptive inference and homeostatic regulation. The ensuing homeostatic (or allostatic) perspective provides an intuitive explanation for how priors act as drives or goals to enslave action, and emphasises the embodied nature of inference. 2015 The Authors.

Introduction The animal must respond to changes in the environment in such a manner that its responsive activity is directed towards the preservation of its existence. This conclusion holds also if we consider the living organism in terms of physical and chemical science. Every material system can exist as an entity only so long as its internal forces, attraction, cohesion, etc., balance the external forces acting upon it. [ ] Being a definite circumscribed material system, it can only continue to exist so long as it is in continuous equilibrium with the forces external to it . Ivan Pavlov Current associative learning theories in psychology and neuroscience assume that animal behaviour depends on multiple forms of control (i.e., Pavlovian, goal-directed, and habitual processes). These control schemes are based on associations between stimuli, actions and outcomes and are either innate or learned through experience. Our aim is to offer an integrative perspective by contextualizing classical formulations of adaptive behaviour within the Active Inference framework, which extends predictive coding from the domain of perception to cover action ( Friston et al., 2009 ). Active Inference assumes that organisms act to fulfil prior expectations that encode the (evolutionarily) values of their states (e.g., having access to food). The mathematical foundation of Active Inference rests on the notion of free energy minimization , where the lonterm average of free energy approximates the entropy of sensory states. Minimizing free energy (and therefore entropy) enables an organism to resist the dispersive effects of ‘‘ external forces acting upon it ’’ to ensure ‘‘ it is in continuous equilibrium with the forces external to it ’’ ( Pavlov, 2010 ). Crucially, free energy can also be interpreted in a statistical sense as an approximation to Bayesian model evidence",

    "chunk_text": ". Crucially, free energy can also be interpreted in a statistical sense as an approximation to Bayesian model evidence. This means Active Inference can be described normatively as maximizing (a negative free energy bound on the logarithm of) Bayesian model evidence. In other words, minimiing free energy reduces the discrepancy (e.g., prediction error) between sensations and their predictions. This discrepancy can be reduced by changing predictions – through perception – or by selectively sampling sensory inputs that were predicted – through action ( Friston, 2010 ). The basic premise of this article is that the ontology of behavioural paradigms in associative learning can be seen as a successive contextualisation of more elemental sensorimotor constructs, within generative models of increasing hierarchical depth. This formulation explains how the primitive sensorimotor architecture of homeostatic control – of our early evolutionary ancestors – evolved towards goal-directed and prospective forms of control. This phylogenetic progression rests on the hierarchical elaboration of more primitive architectures ( Cisek and Kalaska, 2010; Pezzulo and Castelfranchi, 2009 ). Furthermore, this hierachical elaboration dissolves any apparent mechanistic distinction between the optimization processes that underlie different control or learning schemes, suggesting that they are all manifestations of Active Inference – under various contexts or conditions ( Friston et al., 2009 ). This novel hypothesis contrasts with the standard (associative learning) view that the computations underlying different forms of behavioural control are fundamentally different and appeal to different (optimization) principles. We first review associative learning theories of homeostatic and behavioural control",

We then offer an Active Inference formulation of adaptive behaviour that fulfils homoeostatic imperatives in increasingly sophisticated ways – building upon peripheral (somatic and autonomic) reflexes to explain simple Pavlovian and instrumental motor responses and, finally, complex goadirected behaviour. A crucial aspect of this hierarchical perspective is that higher-level hierarchical representations contextualize lower levels and predict longer sequences of cues and responses. This is accommodated by predictions about transitions over increasingly protracted time scales ( Friston, 2008; Pezzulo, 2012 ). 2. Homeostatic regulation and adaptive behavioural control in associative learning theories Cannon (1929) first proposed that the evolutionary function of physiology and behaviour is to restrict homeostatic states to a physiologically tenable range. Homeostatic regulation therefore allows animals to maintain a ‘‘ continuous equilibrium ’’ between the internal milieu and environmental states, which ( Pavlov, 2010 ) considered the raison d’eˆtre for our brains. The regulation of homeostatic states – or of allostatic processes ( Sterling and Eyer, 1988 ) – has long been described in terms of control-theoretic and cybernetic mechanisms of error cancellation and feedback control ( Ashby, 1947 ). At the neurobiological level, one hypothesis is that homeostatic control requires interoceptive signals that report current homeostatic levels (e.g., the current level of glucose in the blood) ( Craig, 2010; Damasio and Carvalho, 2013; Gu et al., 2013 ). A hungry animal can be described as an animal whose homeostatic condition departs significantly from a level that is ‘good’ for survival. With some simplifications, the ‘good’ level of glucose is used as a reference for the controller to steer action (e.g., ingest food to restore the level of glucose)",

This form of autonomic regulation involves triggering autnomic reflexes that control bodily processes such as heart rate, blood pressure and peristalsis. Under some conditions, autonomic reflexes can restore homeostatic levels (e.g., a hyperthermic animal can cool down by perspiring). Although elemental, autonomic reflexes are not sufficient to fully support homoeotasis: to satisfy hunger or thirst, the animal must act on the external world. Early theories of homeostatic regulation focused on simple (e.g., approach or avoidance) constituents of an innate behavioural repertoire. However, higher animals learn to achieve their goals in complex and flexible ways that go well beyond approach and avoidance. To do this they must acquire an adequate behavioural repertoire and learn to select from currently available actions or sequences of action (policies). This is the main focus of associative learning theories in psychology and biology. 2.1. A taxonomy of behavioural controllers in the associative learning literature Contemporary associative learning theories assume that action selection depends on the continuous cooperation and competition of several behavioural controllers, which can be divided into ‘‘Pavlovian’’ and ‘‘instrumental’’ (goal-directed and habitual) ( Balleine and Dickinson, 1998; Daw et al., 2005; Dayan, 2009 ). Behavioural reflexes represent a basic form of controller that constitutes the innate repertoire of most animals. This controller is rather limited, as it calls on a limited set of unconditioned responses (e.g., approaching and ingesting food or withdrawing from a painful stimulus) in response to a circumscribed and predefined class of stimuli (called unconditioned stimuli ). Still, this controller is sufficient for most animals to survive, even without any experience-dependent learning",

    "chunk_text": ". Still, this controller is sufficient for most animals to survive, even without any experience-dependent learning. Pavlovian (classical) conditioning is the process by which an unconditioned stimulus (say, food), that triggers an unconditioned reflex (say, salivation), is repeatedly paired with a neutral stimulus (say, a bell). The pairing is thought to produce stimulus-stimulus associations (between the food and the bell). After several pairings, the (formerly) neutral stimulus is able – on its own – to trigger a reflex called a conditioned response (salivation when the bell rings). An evolutionary imperative for acquiring a conditioned response is that the stimulus-stimulus associations capture (ecologically) G. Pezzulo et al. / Progress in Neurobiology 134 (2015) 17–35 18 valid statistical contingencies: if conditioned stimuli are good predictors of unconditioned stimuli, they have inherent relevance for survival. Classical conditioning mechanisms generally have limited scope and only capture a small range of predefined responses – not the acquisition of novel behaviours. More complex forms of associative learning guide the acquistion of instrumental responses, which are assumed to maximize some goal or value function. Among these, flexible forms of control consider goal-directed actions . For example, while ingesting food can be considered as a behavioural reflex for a hungry animal, foraging for food is a complex skill – requiring the acquisition and coordination of action sequences over time. Truly goal-directed actions are considered to be oriented towards (and engaged by) a goal (i.e., an action outcome, say the expected sound of a ringing bell or the predicted sight or taste of a food). Empirically, a behaviour is considered to be goal-directed if, and only if, it is sensitive to changes in reward contingencies, as revealed by reward devaluation and contingency degradation paradigms ( Balleine and Dickinson, 1998 )",

    "chunk_text": ". This sensitivity gives goal-directed actions their characteristic flexibility and context sensitivity. However, this comes at a cost: to act in a goal-directed manner an animal must know (learn) the causal effects of its actions. This process is often described as the acquisition of sets of associations ( Dickinson, 2012 ), including (bidirectional) actiooutcome associations. When used in the forward direction (from action to outcome), these associations permit the prediction of the sensory consequences of possible actions. When used in the backward direction (from outcome to action), the implicit mapping enables the selection of an action that produces the (desired) consequences. This computational perspective maps nicely onto ideomotor theory ( Hommel et al., 2001; Prinz, 1997 ) and the distinction between forward and inverse models of motor control ( Wolpert et al., 1998 ). Note that all these computations must be contextualized, because any given action can produce different outcomes in different situations. This implies that the selection of a specific goal-directed action requires a complex computational process (formally, the solution to an inverse problem ). In this sense, action selection depends on the sort of deliberation found in model-based schemes, such as tree searches (e.g., used to solve Markov decision problems) or ‘planning-as-inference’ ( Botvinick and Toussaint, 2012 ) – the latter being closely related to Active Inference (see below). A simpler kind of instrumental controller involves routines or habits . Habits do not require purposeful deliberation and are stimulus driven (not goal-driven): a stimulus activates simpler ‘‘cached’’ action-value representations, learned through experiening past reinforcements. This renders habitual computation quite ‘cheap’, but at the expense of flexibility. For example, habitual mechanisms do not adapt immediately to changes in reward contingencies but need extensive re-learning. The controllers considered above interact by cooperating or competing",

The controllers considered above interact by cooperating or competing. For example, it has been suggested that habitual and goal-directed control compete to control action based on uncertainty ( Daw et al., 2005 ). In addition, various bidirectional interactions between instrumental and Pavlovian mechanisms have been proposed ( Dayan, 2009 ). More recent formulations emphasize cooperation, rather than only competition ( Daw and Dayan, 2014; Dolan and Dayan, 2013; Keramati et al., 2011; O’Doherty et al., 2015; Pezzulo et al., 2013 ; see also Daw et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2014 ) for relevant empirical evidence that supports an integrative viewpoint. In particular, these accounts are consistent with the current view in that it is the precision or reliability of alternative controllers that arbitrates their relative contribution. These treatments rest on normative principles and explore various trade-offs between (mental or fictive) exploration and exploitation; for example, trading fast inaccurate solutions for slow accurate solutions. However, these formulations tend to assume that different controllers conform to distinct computtional principles (say, model-based vs. model-free) and – with some noteworthy exceptions ( Dezfouli and Balleine, 2012; Pezzulo and Castelfranchi, 2009 ) – do not consider how more complex controllers could have developed from earlier (less flexible) controllers. Below, we introduce a view of adaptive behaviour in which behavioural controllers are assimilated successively into an Active Inference scheme; showing how more complex forms of control are elaborated from simpler processes – thereby contextualizing and linking them hierarchically in terms of their temporal and functional scope. 3",

Homeostatic processes and adaptive behavioural controllers in Active Inference Active Inference assumes that the brain is a statistical organ that learns a generative model of its environment ( Dayan et al., 1995; Friston, 2010; Friston et al., 2009; Helmholtz, 1866 ). The theory extends predictive coding to the domain of actioperception loops. In predictive coding, perception is regarded as an inference process ( Gregory, 1980 ), whose aim is to minimize prediction errors or the difference between empirical priors (which play the role of perceptual hypotheses) and current sensations. Empirical priors are just representations or expectations that provide top-down predictions in hierarchical models of how sensations are generated. Prediction errors at every level of the hierarchy are then minimized by adjusting (empirical) prior expectations. This optimization process can be understood, neurobiologically, as recurrent message passing among levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy. The resulting optimization of prior expectations or beliefs corresponds to perceptual inference. Crucially, Active Inference considers another way to minimize prediction errors; namely, through action. The simplest form of action corresponds to peripheral reflexes , which can be of an autonomic or somatic sort – depending upon whether the muscles engaged are smooth or striated: see Fig. 1 (left). From the point of view of Active Inference, the purpose of a peripheral reflex is to suppress proprioceptive or interoceptive prediction errors through closed loop control ( Friston, 2011 ). The set point or equilibrium point of the reflex can be nuanced by descending predictions that project to prediction error populations (red triangles) that send efferents to neuromuscular junctions. This efferent outflow will cease when the interoceptive or propriocetive feedback matches the descending prediction (blue arrows). 3.1",

Homeostatic regulation through autonomic reflexes and unconditioned responses The aforementioned control loop is usually associated with arc reflexes and the suppression of proprioceptive prediction errors through action ( Feldman and Friston, 2010; Shipp et al., 2013 ). In addition, the same loop can perform homeostatic regulation through autonomic reflexes ( Pezzulo, 2013; Seth, 2013; Seth et al., 2012 ) – a process that has long been understood in terms of error cancellation ( Cannon, 1929 ). The Active Inference loop shown in Fig. 1 (right panel) illustrates how autonomic reflexes minimize interoceptive predictions and thus assure ‘good’ levels of autonomic states. This process introduces a circular causality between homeostatic variables and autonomic reflexes, as the former triggers the latter and vice versa. Autonomic reflexes can also facilitate other homeostatic reflexes, as illustrated in Ivan Pavlov’s example of how salivation facilitates ingestion: ‘‘Edible substances evoke the secretion of thick, concentrated saliva. Why? The answer, obviously, is that this enables the mass of food to pass G. Pezzulo et al. / Progress in Neurobiology 134 (2015) 17–35 19 smoothly through the tube leading from the mouth into the stomach.’’ (Ivan Pavlov, 1904 Nobel Lecture). Although autonomic reflexes allow a continuous monitoring and control of bodily events, they are not sufficient for allostasis in complex environments – animals must take action to survive. Ultimately, actions must be selected that enable them to maintain some states (e.g., glucose level) within a viable range; either directly (homoeostasis) or indirectly (allostasis). However, allstatic control is a difficult control problem, as there is a necessarily distal temporal relation between actions and their consequences, particularly at the level of homeostatic regulation and interocetion",

This so-called credit assignment problem makes closed loop homoeostatic control of interoceptive prediction errors probleatic. How then should one choose the appropriate sequence of actions to maintain homeostasis? Many researchers have proposed that the solution to this problem rests on re-representing bodily (and related) events centrally , through various interoceptive channels ( Craig, 2010 ) – and also in the form of feelings that influence decision-making ( Damasio and Carvalho, 2013 ). In this vein, we suggest that the best way to finesse the credit assignment problem is to learn (hierarchical) models of how interoceptive signals are generated. Much like perceptual hierarchies, these interoceptive models predict interoceptive events over different timescales and thus anticipate homeostatic needs. Homoeostasis is often described as a reactive mechanism but in fact it can be more sophisticated than that ( Barrett and Simmons, 2015 ). Animals do not actually react to hypoglycaemic sensations, but much earlier, so that they can act (e.g., eat) before dangerous and unpredicted internal states (e.g., hypoglycaemia) are experienced. This anticipatory ability can be supported by generative models describing how interoceptive signals change over time, conditioned on some (future) behaviour. For example, prior to an energy-consuming activity, one can anticipate its hypoglycaemic consequences and prepare food. Many homestatic phenomena are periodic and this makes their prediction possible, at least to some extent. Further, evidence indicates that hormones linked to metabolic processes such as insulin ( Woods et al., 1970 ) and ghrelin ( Drazen et al., 2006 ) can be conditioned and initiate anticipatory allostatic processes",

By analogy, using interoceptive prediction errors to infer a preparatory behavioural set – before homoeostatic extremis (e.g., profound hypoglycamia) – allows animals to act in advance and, in essence, avoid anticipated losses of glucose rather than react to actual losses. Conceptually, this speaks to the tenet of the good regulator theorem; namely, that any allostatic or homoeostatic system must entail a model of its exchange with the environment ( Conant and Ashby, 1970 ). Another pointer towards a hierarchical architecture is that – in the brain – interoceptive and proprioceptive channels are not directly interconnected at lower hierarchical levels; see Fig. 2 . While autonomic reflexes can directly minimize interoceptive prediction errors through reciprocal message passing, arc reflexes can only be engaged vicariously through higher (multimodal) cortical and subcortical systems. The homeostatic variables that have to be maintained within a safe range cannot be (technically speaking) controlled directly. In other words, it is not possible to use interoceptive prediction errors directly to enslave action in the same way as proprioceptive prediction errors produce movement. However, at a slower timescale, higher levels – that integrate multimodal information including ascending interoceptive prdiction errors about impending homoeostatic violations – are in a position to engage action through descending proprioceptive predictions (see below). In Active Inference, these central representations of bodily events take the form of hierarchical generative models – models that describe the consequences of sensorimotor contingencies at multiple (exteroceptive, proprioceptive, and interoceptive) levels. The models are called ‘generative’ because they can generate – in a top-down manner – the expected (sensory) consequences of latent (hidden) causes. The generative model shown in Fig",

The generative model shown in Fig. 2 links exteroceptive, proprioceptive, and interoceptive information by jointly reprsenting their hidden or latent causes (e.g., a cause can embody the prior knowledge that the sight of a burger will produce certain visual and gustatory sensations, that it affords a grasping action, and ultimately that it increases the level of glucose in the blood). The same idea arises in embodied predictive coding , where perceptual inference minimizes both sensory and proprioceptive error ( Pezzulo, 2013 ). These models necessarily entail a sensormotor-to-interoceptive mapping that encodes associations between sensorimotor and interoceptive events; say, ‘‘a burger in my mouth’’ (a sensorimotor event) generates (and predicts) ‘‘more glucose in my blood’’ (an interoceptive event). The acquisition of these models is made possible by the fact that sensorimotor events are reflected by variations in the interoceptive domain, as the two are causally related (e.g., through the embodied gastric system). The lowest levels of these models might be reified in anatomy; for example, embodied in the functioning of the gastric system ( Mayer, 2011 ). In sum, generative models linking sensorimotor and interocetive events resolve a key aspect of homeostatic regulation. They enable the use (and suppression) of sensorimotor prediction errors as proxies for (the suppression of) interoceptive prediction errors, Fig. 1. Peripheral reflexes in Active Inference.

Interoceptive prediction errors (e.g., the difference between the expected level of glucose and the currently sensed level) can be suppressed by autonomic reflexes, much like proprioceptive prediction errors (e.g., the difference between the expected and actual position of my finger) can be suppressed directly via arc reflexes. G. Pezzulo et al. / Progress in Neurobiology 134 (2015) 17–35 20 which are hard to control at short timescales. For example, I can harness the association between ingesting a burger, the sensation of a full stomach and the (future) restoration of blood glucose levels. These associations mean that the exteroceptive prediction errors (that report the fact that I am not currently eating) can be resolved by acting (eating) to suppress interoceptive prediction errors in the future. In this view, while the variable to be controlled is homeostatic, the states that an organism controls are sensormotor (e.g., eating). This perspective also speaks to valence and feelings – and their putative adaptive functions ( Damasio and Carvalho, 2013 ). Fig. 3 shows an Active Inference formulation of unconditioned responses. This is an extension of the reflexive control loop of Fig. 1 that places the peripheral reflexes under higher (central) control, through the provision of descending predictions that provide a reference point or set point. This architecture bridges the gap between interoceptive signals (e.g., a gustatory input) and autonomic responses (e.g., salivation). The (unpredicted) gustatory sensations of food can elicit ascending gustatory prediction errors that in turn elicit descending predictions of taste sensations and (consummatory) interoception.

In this schematic, exteroceptive, interoceptive and proprioceptive systems are shown as being relatively separated in terms of hierarchical neuronal systems. At the point of convergence – at higher levels of the hierarchy (here the Prefrontal Cortex) – the representations become amodal or multimodal – providing descending predictions in the exteroceptive, autonomic and proprioceptive domains.

In this cartoon, the temporal contingencies are modelled through interactions between the error (red) and expectation (blue) populations at the top of the hierarchy.

This fact marks an important difference with the associative learning literature, where unconditioned responses are supposed to be controlled by cues (i.e., they are stimulus-response mappings). In Active Inference, they are implemented within generative architectures that encode stimulustimulus associations or contingencies, where responses are elicited peripherally to minimize (interoceptive or proprioceptive) predition error. In this setting, a prediction encoded at higher hierarchical levels (say, the sensation of tasting a burger) becomes an equilibrium or ‘reference point’ in control-theoretic formulations. Besides their importance per se, unconditioned responses are crucial to scaffold increasingly more complex forms of behavioural control that are acquired through learning (rather than being innate). These new strategies essentially extend and contextualize the animal’s innate repertoire of stimulus bound responses in an open-ended way. 3.2. Towards more sophisticated forms homeostatic regulation: the hierarchical architecture supporting adaptive behavioural control Animals can come pre-equipped with a fixed repertoire of reflexes (e.g., approaching-food behaviour) enabling them to satisfy their basic needs (e.g., hunger), under restricted conditions. However, they can learn increasingly more sophisticated ways to maintain homeostasis (e.g., from eating a food in front of me, to opening a fridge, to buying food for dinner). Associative learning theory describes these strategies in terms of multiple behavioural controllers (i.e., Pavlovian, goal-directed and habitual). In Active Inference, these forms of control are not segregated, but it is possible to subsume them within a hierarchical architecture that builds on the control loop shown in Figs. 1 and 3",

In Active Inference, these forms of control are not segregated, but it is possible to subsume them within a hierarchical architecture that builds on the control loop shown in Figs. 1 and 3 . High levels in hierarchical models contextualize lower level expectations through descending or backward connections, and eventually, at the peripheral level of the hierarchy, nuance motor and autonomic reflexes (which are thus conserved in an evolutionary sense). In this scheme, a cascade of descending predictions set the equilibrium points of reflexes, where these predictions are – in principle – informed by deep hierarchical processing. We now review this formulation, beginning with a focus on what associative learning theories call control , namely how behaviour arises from different processes; and then considering how these processes are learned in the face of new experience ( Mackintosh, 1983 ). 3.2.1. Pavlovian responses Based on the central (sensorimotor) predictions in Fig. 3 , Pavlovian control arises when descending predictions encompass predictive exteroceptive cues. In this case, the model acquires exteroceptive -tinteroceptive sensory mappings, where the first sensory event is the conditioned stimulus (say a bell) and the second is an unconditioned stimulus (say, the taste of a burger). As shown in Fig. 4 , the stimulus-stimulus associations underlying Pavlovian conditioning are instantiated by a high-level represetation of a conditioned stimulus that is inserted into the sequence of expected events. This means that the conditioned stimulus (here the sound of a bell) elicits auditory prediction errors that engage top-down predictions of appropriate auditory input, which – at the same time – predict the emergence of interoceptive sensations that produce the unconditioned reflex. Descending predictions engage peripheral reflexes – establishing a (vertical) link between the conditioned stimulus and unconditioned response",

Here, the highest-level expectations absorb the unconditioned reflex into dynamical predictions that support Pavlovian responses. Fig. 4. Pavlovian responses. In this schematic, we have added a hierarchical level that incorporates exteroceptive predictions (here, of a ringing bell) into its model of state transitions. This higher-level construct represents the sound of a bell that portends interoceptive changes that induce autonomic reflexes (or unconditioned responses). Because the highest level now provides predictions in the exteroceptive and interoceptive domain, it enables perceptual inference to elicit autonomic responses, providing interoceptive predictions that can be fulfilled by smooth muscle reflexes. Here, the agent’s model of the world involves a bell ringing that causes gustatory events that induce salivation. Optimizing expectations about auditory objects corresponds to predictive coding of auditory input and the perception of bell ringing; while descending interoceptive predictions cancel gustatory prediction error and descending predictions about the state of smooth muscle reflexively elicit salivation. G. Pezzulo et al. / Progress in Neurobiology 134 (2015) 17–35 22 Note that in this scheme, different hierarchical levels of the generative model act in concert. The aforementioned closed loop reflexes afford a basic (but restricted) repertoire of responses to salient sensory events. Sensory-to-sensory associations expand this initial repertoire beyond cues that are specified innately. The hierarchical composition of models permits the open-ended evaluation of sensory events and adaptation to changing enviromental contingencies (which would be precluded by purely innate mechanisms).

It is worth noting that associative explanations of conditioning – based on the pairing of (conditioned and unconditioned) stimuli – have proven to be somewhat limited; for example, they do not cover associations between stimuli and context. Rather, it has been proposed that conditioning depends on expectations based on knowledge of the relations between events at large ( Rescorla, 1988 ). In terms of Active Inference, this implies that the generative models not only encode associations between stimuli or between conditioned stimuli and reward delivery; rather, they are latent cause models that reconstruct the hidden processes jointly responsible for context, sensory and reinforcing events ( Courville et al., 2006 ). Note that latent cause models have not been generalized to instrumental responses – but this generalization is straightforward in Active Inference, because the predictions generated by the models can elicit action. 3.2.2. Instrumental responses A further hierarchical extension now allows the addition of proprioceptive and exteroceptive cues that lead to the Pavlovian response. This provides a mechanistic basis for instrumental behaviour, which is usually linked to habitual control in associative learning models and permits adaptive behavioural patterns to be stabilized through learning. In the example shown in Fig. 5 , imagine that an animal has learned that a bell rings whenever its hand moves. This association is encoded by high-level representations of the implicit conjuntion of proprioceptive and auditory input that plays the role of a sensorimotor construct or contingency ( O’Regan and Noe, 2001 ). Crucially, the motor responses producing the predicted propriceptive input will be elicited reflexively (through peripheral reflexes), whenever they are engaged by descending predictions",

Crucially, the motor responses producing the predicted propriceptive input will be elicited reflexively (through peripheral reflexes), whenever they are engaged by descending predictions. Note how the sound of a bell engenders posterior expectations about the Pavlovian response that – mediated by prediction errors ascending to the top of the hierarchy – will produce posterior expectations about the conditioned response. This may be a plausible mechanism for Pavlovian-Instrumental transfer (PIT) and in particular PIT-specific phenomena ( Corbit and Balleine, 2011 ). 3.2.3. Goal-directed behaviour The aforementioned scheme can be equipped with a further hierarchical extension that predicts contextual cues associated with instrumental responses. Fig. 6 illustrates a simple example of goal-directed behaviour – choosing somewhere to eat – which extends the previous example using conditional or contextualizing (exteroceptive) stimuli; e.g. a restaurant sign. In this example, descending predictions select the conditional response through adjusting the gain or precision of prediction errors at the lower instrumental level in the hierarchy (circular arrowhead). In Active Inference, a high precision implies that descending predictions will dominate posterior beliefs. This ensures that the predicted sequence of behaviour is enacted, through peripheral reflexes Fig. 5. Instrumental responses. Here, we have supplemented the hierarchy of Fig. 6 to include proprioceptive precedents of a conditioned exteroceptive stimulus – here some hand movement. This means that moving the hand induces expectations or predictions about the sound of the bell that, in turn, elicit lower-level expectations leading to a conditioned response. In other words, this hierarchical extension enables Pavlovian conditioning to enslave instrumental responses. G. Pezzulo et al. / Progress in Neurobiology 134 (2015) 17–35 23 ( Friston et al., 2012a ). Later, we will consider the role of dopamine in optimizing the precision of action selection in this way",

Later, we will consider the role of dopamine in optimizing the precision of action selection in this way. The key distinguishing feature of goal-directed systems rests on the form of the inference they require. In contrast with Pavlovian and instrumental controllers, goal-directed systems represent (counterfactual) future states, and minimize the difference between the preferred or goal state and outcomes predicted from the current state. See Friston et al. (2013) for a formal example using Markov decision processes. This prospective form of control is supported by the ability of higher hierarchical levels to anticipate the future and to select policies that enslave action ( Friston et al., 2010; Pezzulo, 2012 ). In contradistinction to classical controllers, the generative models described above capture increasingly more distal relations between actions and outcomes (say choosing food from a menu or even buying food to put in the fridge) that can be encoded in the form of extended cue-response sequences in higher hierarchical levels ( Friston, 2008 ). They thus enable the modelling of counterfactual outcomes and the selection of policies that allow goals to be reached. Furthermore, these models can accommodate generic priors, such as action costs. However, the prosecution of control sequences still calls on exactly the same hierarchical structures that underpin more elemental and unsupervised forms of learning – right down to motor and autonomic reflexes in the periphery. 3.2.4. The interaction between controllers in the Active Inference framework Associative learning theories hypothesize that behaviour results from the interaction between different controllers. For instance – in relation to goal-directed and habitual interactions – an influential model proposes that the two controllers compete to control behaviour on the basis of their relative precision or confidence ( Daw et al., 2005 )",

    "chunk_text": ". In Active Inference, the apparently distinct forms of control map onto specific levels within a single hierarchical architecture. Indeed, the different controllers can be represented along a continuum from sophisticated goal-directed models (Bayesian graphs) to simpler sensorimotor loops or subgraphs. Higher order levels contextualize lower levels through backward connections that provide empirical priors. Crucially, these descending expectations optimize both content and context – in the form of expected states and expected precision , respectively. The descending influence of higher order levels depends on the relative precision (or confidence) of prediction errors at each level of the hierarchy. When higher levels have greater precision, their contextual influence dominates; whereas, when expected sensory precision is high, inference and subsequent behaviour is driven by sensory evidence. This fits comfortably with the relative influence of hierarchically deep (goal directed) and shallow (habitual) levels of control that are balanced in terms of their relative salience or, in predictive coding, precision ( FitzGerald et al., 2014 ). In Active Inference, control is not dichotomized into two discrete systems, but viewed as distributed along a graded continuum going from the highest levels of abstract, prospective and conscious reasoning to more concrete, short-sighted unconscious levels of reasoning down to the arc reflex. See Bates and Elman (1993) , for similar considerations in the context of connectionist models. Within this framework, phenomena usually interpreted as arising from conflict between different controllers (e.g., goal-directed vs. habitual) can be reinterpreted as the failure of high-order levels to contextualize lower-order levels. For example, devaluation occurs when an animal – after learning an action-outcome contingency (e.g., lever pressing to obtain food pellets) – stops performing the action after the outcome associated with the action has lost is palatability (e.g., after satiation)",

A large body of evidence has shown that overtrained, contrary to undertrained, rats are unaffected by devaluation, since they continue to perform the action even when the associated outcome ceases to be palatable ( Balleine and Dickinson, 1998 ). Current associative learning theories interpret the resistance to devaluation in overtrained rats as a replacement of Fig. 6. Goal-directed responses. In this final extension, we have added contextual exteroceptive cues (e.g., a restaurant sign) that enable the highest level to select the sensorimotor contingencies underlying instrumental or conditioned responses. Goal-directed behaviour can be regarded as the highest level of (model-based) control that embodies all the ingredients of Active Inference. G. Pezzulo et al. / Progress in Neurobiology 134 (2015) 17–35 24 goal-directed control – based on action-outcome contingencies – by habitual control – based on stimulus-reward learning. From an Active Inference perspective, a resistance to devalution can be interpreted as a failure to contextualize low-level instrumental inference (including sequences of predictions about the proprioceptive sensations associated with the action perfomance; e.g., those associated with lever pressing and food pellets consumption) by higher levels that infer the motivational state. This failure is due to the fact that the low level, after over-training, has acquired a relatively higher precision and is therefore unaffected by descending predictions that have access to motivational information. Although higher levels may ‘know’ that performing the action will not lead to a valuable outcome, they have lost the ability to attenuate the precision of sensory levels during overtraining (where the animal has learned this attenuation is redundant). This can be modelled in the Active Inference framework by placing a high precision on sensory prediction errors, which can then activate reflexes directly",

    "chunk_text": ". This can be modelled in the Active Inference framework by placing a high precision on sensory prediction errors, which can then activate reflexes directly. More generally, placing a high precision on sensory prediction errors produces habitisation (i.e., the shift from goal-directed to habitual control), where habits directly activate reflexes and preclude (unnecessary) inference at higher hierarchical levels. This produces the equivalent of a so-called habitual controller, which does not depend on goals encoded at higher hierarchical levels but rather acts reactively. In other words, a stimulus (say, the visual impression of a lever) triggers descending predictions of lever pressing sensations, which (when afforded high precision) engages an arc reflex. Lever pressing then minimizes (precise) sensory prediction error, even when the further consequences of pressing a lever, say receiving food, are neither predicted nor desired. Habitisation can help saving (cognitive or other) resources, but it could also be involved in some forms of addiction. For example, an initially outcome-based drug taking behaviour can become insensitive to the actual effects of the drugs, and be controlled directly by a drug-predicting cue ( Robbins and Everitt, 1999 ). Habitisation can occur at multiple levels of a hierarchical architecture. However, the lower levels of the generative models may be habitised first, because they deal with more elemental, stereotyped and reproducible responses. With practice (e.g., elitlevel sport skills), habits can include longer sequences of actions ( Dezfouli and Balleine, 2012 ) and also possibly involve higher hierarchical levels ( Pezzulo et al., 2010 ). This normative view of the interactions between goal-directed and stimulus-bound actions rests on finding an optimal balance between the (computational) costs and benefits of inference. Indeed, once an action or skill is learned and is sufficiently reliable, it can be called upon with minimal processing costs and thus becomes a habit",

Let us imagine that an animal is learning the contingencies between an action (say a lever press) and its consequence (say the appearance of some food that the animal can consume). When the contingency between a stimulus (the appearance of the lever), the action (pressing) and the ensuing reinforcement (consumption of the food) is reliable, the animal should stick with the habitual and reinforced lever pressing action rather than performing a model-based search for a better option. This example illustrates that a hierarchical architecture for adaptive control leads to the problem of exploration vs. exploitation ( Baum, 2004; Pezzulo et al., 2013 ), where a model-based search (a covert form of exploration) should only be performed if its expected benefits – in terms of reinforcement – exceed its computational costs; otherwise the habitual lever pressing action should be directly exploited. In Active Inference, free energy minimization solves this dilemma for free. Technically, the objective function in Active Inference is a free energy bound on the logarithm of Bayesian model evidence. This bound can be decomposed into accuracy and complexity. If the model is sufficient to accurately predict a succession of stimuli associated with habitual responding, then further optimization can only be achieved by minimizing complexity costs. This is exactly the same as removing (redundant) model parameters that hitherto provided top-down contextual control. Indeed, in a world where habitual responding always leads to valuable outcomes, it is suboptimal to contextualize habits – because this would lead to generalization failures and ultimately to ‘‘overfitting’’, in the same way over parameterized statistical models tend to fit ‘noise’ in the data rather than capturing regularities",

However, occasionally cues can be misleading and thus habitual controllers would prescribe an inappropriate action. It is exactly these rare occasions that are exploited experimentally to assess whether an animal is under the control of a habitual or a goal-directed mechanism (e.g., in devaluation paradigms). Resistance to devaluation and habitisation also illustrates how, in Active Inference, attention modulates the relative precision of the different levels of the hierarchy ( Feldman and Friston, 2010 ). Attention can favour the integration of contextual information by increasing the precision of higher-level representations, for instance facilitating goal-directed control over a habitual response. This mechanism is important in several circumstances where contextualization becomes adaptive. Cognitive conflict occurs in behavioural paradigms such as the Stroop and the Flanker tests ( Botvinick et al., 2001 ). In these, the goal-directed system needs to inhibit a prepotent maladaptive Pavlovian or habitual response. Cognitive conflict emerges because both low-level representations (Pavlovian or habitual) and goal-directed representations have high precision. The conflict can be resolved when attention resources increase goal-directed precision. Similarly, when an error occurs along a sequence of habitual responses, the prediction error triggers a change in expected precision and the deployment of attention to increase descending goal-directed influences, thus contextualizing habitual mechanisms and enabling corrective or remedial responses. This mechanism would explain why habitual actions (e.g., turning left at a crossroad because this is the path I take every day) could be initiated but also successively reversed by goals (e.g., after a habit-based preparation of a left turn, one can decide to turn right because today I am not going to my office)",

The same scheme could support postdictive inference ; for example, an action can be initiated by habit (thus before its consequences are fully predicted) and successively a goal-based prediction can be generated to monitor and verify retrospectively that the cosequences were expected and desired. To summarize, in Active Inference, there is a unique and Bayes optimal solution for contextualizing hierarchical behaviours that is based upon optimizing expected precision – very much in the same way that we carefully evaluate the standard error of our predictions based on scientific data. The expression of these predictions, under different conditions, produces goal-directed action or habits. The implicit flexibility and context-sensitive balance is therefore based on our relative confidence in predictions at different hierarchical levels. This speaks to a possible phylogenetic trajectory of hierarchical brain architectures that subtend more sophisticated forms of control by reusing and contextualizing simpler control processes ( Cisek and Kalaska, 2010; Pezzulo and Castelfranchi, 2009 ). 3.3. Learning the generative models required for hierarchical inference In Active Inference, there is a crucial distinction between inference and learning . Inference refers to the moment-to-moment G. Pezzulo et al. / Progress in Neurobiology 134 (2015) 17–35 25 estimation of the hidden causes of sensations and corresponds to state or value estimation in standard models of behaviour. This contrasts with learning the parameters of the models predicting state transitions, which proceeds over much longer time scales and corresponds to the sort of learning considered in reinforcement and value-learning paradigms. Neurobiologically, inference can be regarded as the (Bayes) optimal updating of synaptic activity encoding expectations at different levels of the hierarchy, while learning is normally associated with the updating of synaptic efficacy or connection strengths that encode causal structure and contingencies in the world",

    "chunk_text": ". There are two levels of which models are acquired and optimized in Active Inference. First, the parameters of any given model can minimize prediction error averaged over suitably long periods of time; this corresponds to changes in connection strength that conform to Hebbian or associative plasticity ( Friston, 2008 ). One interesting aspect of this (activity dependent) plasticity is that it is modulated by the precision or gain applied to postsynaptic responses (of neuronal populations encoding predition error). In other words, prediction error is used as a teaching signal for learning – as in standard reinforcement learning models ( Rescorla and Wagner, 1972; Sutton and Barto, 1998; Watkins and Dayan, 1992 ); however, the learning rate is mediated by precision ( Mathys et al., 2011 ). This has the interesting consequence of assigning dopamine a modulatory role in enabling plasticity based upon prediction errors – as opposed to reporting the errors per se (see later). The second way in which models can be optimized is to change the parameters or neuronal connections themselves – at an evolutionary or somatic (neurodevelopmental) time scale. There have also been proposals that synaptic homoeostasis (and regression) during sleep is a manifestation of model optimiztion ( Hobson and Friston, 2012 ). Notice here that the model is being optimized, as opposed to the parameters or connectivity of any given model. Model optimization is a well-studied problem in statistics, where it is usually resolved through Bayesian model comparison based upon model evidence. Practically, log model evidence is usually approximated with Bayesian information criteria or variational free energy ( Penny, 2012 ). In exactly the same way, Active Inference schemes suppose that the same (variational) free energy that is optimized by inference and learning is used to compare and select generative models in the brain. Indeed, at an evolutionary level, people have proposed free energy functionals of adaptive fitness ( Sella and Hirsh, 2005 )",

    "chunk_text": ". Indeed, at an evolutionary level, people have proposed free energy functionals of adaptive fitness ( Sella and Hirsh, 2005 ). Put simply, there is a well defined (free energy) functional of sensory data that scores the quality of any generative model of environmental exchange. This functional can, in principle, be used to decide whether to add a connection or contingency to the model or, indeed, add a hierarchical level. We have stressed that apparently distinct control systems can be gracefully integrated through hierarchical minimization of prediction error or surprise. One can generalize this theme and regard control, inference, and learning as hierarchically nested beneath model optimization at different timescales; where the imperative to minimize prediction errors (or maximize model evidence) applies universally at all levels. For example, evolution can be regarded as performing Bayesian model selection to minimize (the long-term average of) free energy, while – at a much faster timescales – our motor reflexes minimize free energy by suppressing proprioceptive prediction errors encoded by alpha motor neurons in the spinal-cord. Indeed, Active Inference has even been applied to synaptic remodelling, by considering the minimization of prediction errors at the level of the dendritic tree ( Kiebel and Friston, 2011 ). 4. Summary: motivated behaviour from the Active Inference perspective So far, we have mapped the constructs of associative learning theories onto the hierarchical generative models of Active Inference. Here, we summarize the treatment and provide a general account of motivated behaviour . In the associative learning literature, motivation is often associated with the invigoration of behaviour towards salient stimuli. It acts in concert with learning mechanisms that reinforce and stabilize successful behaviours and ensures that they are emitted in the future with a higher probability ( Balleine et al., 2009; Berridge, 2004 )",

    "chunk_text": ". Despite a general consensus on the role of motivation in the expression and acquisition of adaptive behaiour, formal descriptions have been more elusive. In the Active Inference view, motivated behaviour is based on the joint minimization of interoceptive and exteroceptive sensory prediction error. The first prediction error informs the current motivational need (or drive) of an organism in terms of a discrepancy between optimal homeostatic levels (e.g., hunger in terms of low glucose) and the latter specifies the sensory state or goal that the animal has to produce (by acting) to keep its homeostatic level in a viable range. Generative models of increasing complexity ( Figs. 3–6 ) provide a bridge between the motivational and procedural imperatives. The implicit sensory mappings enable the proprioceptive prediction error to be minimized as a proxy for interoceptive prediction error. In brief, deep hierarchical inference gives rise to control hierarchies that finesse and contextualize adaptive responses. For example, hunger provides a ubiquitous example of a hierarchically elaborated concept that contextualizes behaviour. In the current setting, hunger does not simply reflect an inference about hypoglycaemia but the belief that if I act in this way, I will avoid (surprising) interoceptive (low blood sugar) cues. This reflects the quintessetially counterfactual nature of allostatic processing in hierarchical models. The thesis we pursue in this work is closely related to work on reinforcement learning controllers – and especially hierarchical controllers – for goal-directed and habitual action, and state space models ( Botvinick, 2008; Botvinick and Weinstein, 2014; Daw et al., 2005; Dezfouli et al., 2014; Dezfouli and Balleine, 2012 ). Our primary goal was to contextualize these more recent formulations within a single (and principled) framework based upon hierarchcal generative models",

This (Active Inference) framework is principled because it only assumes the brain is trying to maximize the evidence for its hierarchical model of the world. All the arguments in this paper (and related formulations) follow as corollaries or necessary consequences. Having said this, the proposed framework differs from current associative and reinforcement learning theories in several impotant aspects. First, in Active Inference, a unique strategy (free energy minimization) produces different modes of control under various circumstances. This stands in contrast with the view of multiple independent controllers ( Daw et al., 2005 ) and suggests that the contributions of different behavioural modes are orchestrated within a coherent statistical computation. Second, previous models postulate a qualitative distinction between different forms of control. Instead, we propose a quantitative distinction, where different controllers correspond to different levels in a continuum of abstraction – from the more abstract goal-directed representations to the simple arc reflex. Indeed, we regard the highest level of prospective reasoning – conscious and expressed in linguistic form – contextualizes a more concrete and ‘intuitive’ level of reasoning, which in turn contextualizes more elemental levels and so on, down to the lowest level of the hierarchy – the arc reflex. The level of the G. Pezzulo et al. / Progress in Neurobiology 134 (2015) 17–35 26 hierarchy that guides behaviour in a given moment (the level with the highest precision), determines how much goal-directed (or habitual) control is exerted over behaviour. Thus, unlike most associative or reinforcement learning theories ( Daw et al., 2005 ), the proposed framework does not describe habitual and goal-directed controllers as necessarily competing",

Thus, unlike most associative or reinforcement learning theories ( Daw et al., 2005 ), the proposed framework does not describe habitual and goal-directed controllers as necessarily competing. Instead, they are arranged in a hierarchical scheme in which the latter contextualizes the former. There have been recent proposals that address cooperation between the two controllers ( Daw et al., 2011; Keramati et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2014; Pezzulo et al., 2013 ) and explicit proposals that they might form a hierarchy ( O’Doherty et al., 2015 ). Here, we are not only suggesting that the two controllers might be hierarchically arranged, but that their computations are essentially the same (acknowledging that they operate at different hierarchical levels and on different represetations and contingencies). This hypothesis contrasts with the view that the human brain includes two separate systems for MB and MF control, plus an arbitration system ( O’Doherty et al., 2015 ). In the perspective pursued here, there is only one controller that realizes both goal directed and habitual behaviour, and in which higher levels (that can be considered more goal-directed in the spectrum) contextualize lower levels (that can be considered more habitual). In this view, contextualization depends on the relative precision processing at different hierarchical levels – where, effectively, precision dynamics subsume the role of arbitration. In this setting, hierarchical arbitration emerges in a principled way from free energy minimization and conforms to Active Inference principles, in which top-down and bottom-up message passing updates predictions and prediction errors, respectively. This view stands in contrast with the proposal that hierarchical message passing involves commands, policies or reward prediction errors ( Botvinick, 2008; O’Doherty et al., 2015 ). By the same token, the hierarchical scheme of Active Inference differs from hierarchical reinforcement learning ( Botvinick, 2008; Botvinick and Weinstein, 2014 )",

In hierarchical reinforcement learning, an agent selects either a primitive action or a higher-level action (e.g., an option); and this hierarchical scheme can extent to many levels. In Active Inference, higher hierarchical levels influence lower levels in a top-down manner, but do not replace them. Furthermore, in Active Inference action selection and the balance between hierarchical levels depend on the precision of the representations at various levels, not on optioor action-specific values. These two features also distinguish the proposed framwork from the hierarchical scheme of ( Dezfouli et al., 2014; Dezfouli and Balleine, 2012 ), where the conversion from goadirected to habitual systems depends on a ‘‘chunking’’ mechanism, and the reverse transformation involves ‘‘decomposing action sequences into single actions’’. Furthermore, our scheme for behavioural control is based on Bayesian inference and does not call on reward prediction errors for learning or inference. One advantage of this is the concept of reward is replaced by the realization of prior preferences. This means that epistemic value and pragmatic value (e.g. utility or reward functions) have the same currency and can be accommodated within the same (information hungry) Bayesian scheme – where this Bayesian scheme prescribes how agents can infer or learn reward contingecies ( Friston et al., 2015 ). Also, this normative approach enables an implementation in terms of predictive coding and cybernetic processes, which have some neurobiological plausibility (see Section 5 ). Although there have been other proposals involving Bayesian inference and behavioural control ( Friston et al., 2010; Pezzulo et al., 2013; Solway and Botvinick, 2012 ), none has simultaneously addressed all the controllers in the ontology of animal learning theories, as offered below",

Another distinguishing aspect is that, in this framework, actions are triggered by goals through prediction errors , whereas in most reinforcement learning schemes, responses are triggered by stimuli via associative links – and prediction errors have only a role in learning (e.g., using Temporal Difference learning) ( Sutton and Barto, 1998 ). In this respect, Active Inference is closer to the cybernetic view of purposive regulation ( Miller et al., 1960; Seth, 2014 ) than to standard associative theories. The current formulation is also deeply connected to theories that emphasize the importance of interoceptive signals for affective processing and decision-making ( Craig, 2010; Damasio and Carvalho, 2013 ) and especially the work of Seth and collaborators on interoceptive inference (i.e., Active Inference about interoceptive states) as a basis for emotion and conscious presence ( Seth, 2013; Seth et al., 2012 ). Here, we take a complementary perspective and discuss the combined role of interoceptive, exteroceptive and proprioceptive inference for homeostatic control and adaptive action. By starting from different angles, all these theories highlight multilateral roles of interocetion, whose implications for enactive approaches to cognition (e.g., the affective consequences of goal achievement, and the associated subjective states) remain an important challenge. The Active Inference scheme for adaptive control connects well with hierarchical and layered robotic control architectures ( Arbib, 1992; Brooks, 1991; Tani and Nolfi, 1999; Verschure et al., 2003 ), where higher levels encode goal-directed controllers or schemas that contextualize lower-level reflex or habit-like control loops. Some of these architectures also include a (simplified) internal physiology that grounds higher-level goals ( Verschure et al., 2014 )",

Active Inference solves the problems of action selection and arbitration between levels that are implicit in these robot architectures by using a unitary, biologically-motivated scheme: a homogeneous process of free energy minimization based on a cascade of (precision engineered) predictions and prediction errors. Within this scheme, the balance between goal-directed and habitual components of behaviour can be found in a principled way based on considerations of model model ‘‘accuracy’’ vs. ‘‘complexity’’; see above and ( FitzGerald et al., 2014; Pezzulo et al., 2013 ). Furthermore, Active Inference offers a principled scheme to coordinate the two ‘loops’ that, in these architectures, control physiologic needs and drives (via interoceptive signals) and goal-directed action execution (via proprioceptive and exteroceptive signals), respectively. It remains to be seen if and how these features of Active Inference architectures can be translated into more effective design principles for autonomous goal-directed robots. This new perspective has implications for the role assigned to neuromodulators, and dopamine in particular. In reinforcement learning, phasic and tonic facets of dopaminergic discharges are assumed to encode reward prediction error ( Schultz et al., 1997 ) and average reward expectation, respectively ( Niv et al., 2007 ). In Active Inference, dopamine is associated with expected precision ( Friston et al., 2012a ), which sets the relative gain of ascending projections signalling prediction error ( Friston, 2008 ),. The ensuing precision control can be understood from several perspectives. First, in a hierarchical scheme, precision regulates the predomnance of each level of the hierarchy, with respect to other levels",

The function of dopamine that emerges is that of balancing the relative precision of the different hierarchical levels and thus the complexity of the generative model engaged for inference. As a general rule, simulations suggest that phasic dopamine firing elevates the precision of beliefs (probability distributions) over competing and hierarchically composed policies; thereby enabling more precise action selection. This can explain the empirical evidence that higher postsynaptic dopamine availability is associated with enhanced motor vigour, for instance speeding up reaction times ( Berridge, 2004; Salamone and Correa, 2012 ), and with a very fast ‘habitisation’ of behaviour ( Gremel and Costa, 2013 ). Also, this can explain the observation from several cognitive G. Pezzulo et al. / Progress in Neurobiology 134 (2015) 17–35 27 tasks of an inverted-U function, relating dopamine levels to performance ( Cools and Esposito, 2011 ). This would be the consequence of an optimal dopaminergic activity, which would correspond to the engagement of the level of the generative model with the best speed/accuracy trade-off. The final point speaks to an important issue; namely that the precision or confidence about future behaviour can itself be optimized with respect to free energy or model evidence. In other words, there is an optional precision of beliefs about any choice behaviour under uncertainty. In Active Inference models of choice behaviour ( Friston et al., 2014, 2013 ), precision reports opportunities to achieve a goal (or more precisely, confidence in the opportunities) that invigorate and select action; see Fig. 7",

The expected precision or confidence about preferred outcomes reports on the progress towards the goal – like spatial proximity or sub-goals ( Lepora and Pezzulo, 2015; Maisto et al., 2015 ) – and in accordance with early cybernetic models of purposive action such as the Test-Operate-Test-Exit (TOTE) model ( Miller et al., 1960 ) precision can be updated (in a Bayes optimal fashion) during goal-directed action – rather than just mediating learning by reporting reward prediction errors. This view is compatible with theories that describe dopamine function within a ‘‘wanting’’ system ( Berridge, 2004 ) that is not hedonic (as in the ‘‘liking’’ system) but instrumental to goal pursuit ( Salamone and Correa, 2012 ). Finally, precision regulates the gain of (postsynaptic) prediction errors that drive associative (synaptic) plasticity ( Friston, 2008 ). The post-synaptic effects of dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra varies across target regions (e.g., different portions of basal ganglia and cortex), due, for instance to the complex role of receptors such as D1 and D2 ( Clark and White, 1987 ). This prompts the hypothesis that the effects of increased/decreased dopamine activity vary within and across individuals – an idea that has inspired interpretations of several symptoms and signs in neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, there is much current interest in understanding a failure to attenuate sensory precision as an explanation for several symptoms and signs in neuropsychiatric disorders ( Edwards et al., 2012; Friston et al., 2012a ). Fig. 7 illustrates how a hierarchical scheme can explain one of the cardinal features of dopaminergic discharges. In this example, we used a T-maze to present conditioned stimuli (CS) in the form of cues that indicated which arm was baited with a reward.

Q represents the quality of a policy scored in terms of its (epistemic) value or expected free energy.

The figure compares (simulated) dopamine responses to the CS and unconditioned stimulus (US or reward) before the agent knows where the reward is and after it has inferred its location. This example shows that hierarchical inference offers a sufficient explanation for dopamine responses in terms of the confidence or precision about subsequent behaviour. Here, the CS has epistemic value because it resolves uncertainty about subsequent (goal directed) behaviour. Under these circustances the CS elicits a burst of dopamine firing that is effectively transferred from the US to the CS. See Friston et al. (2015) for details of this particular example. A final important point concerns the relationship between drives and goals. In most psychological theories, drives are usually linked to basic motivations and homoeostasis (e.g., interoceptive hunger or thirst), while goals are considered to have more elaborate (exteroceptive) sensory and cognitive aspects (e.g., dining in a restaurant), but their relations are often unclear from a mechanistic viewpoint ( Pezzulo et al., 2014b; Verschure et al., 2014 ). In Active Inference, goals are ultimately grounded in expectations about physiological allostasis, and engage a cascade of interoceptive, proprioceptive and exteroceptive loops. The objective is to suppress interoceptive prediction errors ( Barrett and Simmons, 2015; Pezzulo, 2013; Seth et al., 2012 ) through action, which in turn requires bodily signals to be represented centrally and controlled through a deep hierarchical modelling that – crucially – engages proprioceptive and exteroceptive loops",

    "chunk_text": ". This implies that at every level of the hierarchy, goals of different complexity are represented that can be distally (and evolutionarly) related to homoeostasis but at the same time are (conditionally) independent from them. Here, conditionally independent means that goals have autonomy in steering and controlling behaviour; for example, the goal of ‘going to a fancy restaurant’ is certainly linked to the drive to eat (or socialize) but it can induce restauransearching behaviour in the absence of hunger. Furthermore, going to a restaurant does not in itself cause a reversal of hypoglycaemia. The ‘autonomisation’ of goals from primary drives is a key feature of higher animals like humans ( Pezzulo and Castelfranchi, 2009 ) and becomes more evident in pathological conditions, where certain goals such as gambling can become pathological and maladaptive ( Montague et al., 2012 ). Autonomy is a general characteristic of hierarchically organized architectures that, necessarily, embody conditional independencies and enable organized behaviour over extended timeframes. This account thus goes beyond purely Hullian, drive-minimzation theories of motivation and emphasizes that an important part of motivated behaviour is directly guided by goals and internal representations of desired future states. Basic drives associated with evolutionary imperatives (e.g., good levels of glucose) naturally constrain the acquisition of new empirical priors that define goals at some (high) level of an agent’s generative model. In turn, these high-level priors contextualize behaviour that is internally consistent with lower-level drives provided they are afforded sufficient precision. Although the ultimate reason for the emergence of goals is that they satisfy some internal drive, the activation of a specific goal might or might not be caused by concurrent interoceptive inference",

Although the ultimate reason for the emergence of goals is that they satisfy some internal drive, the activation of a specific goal might or might not be caused by concurrent interoceptive inference. Thus, the goal system supports and – in a certain sense – supersedes the drive system: ( Montague, 2006 ) speculates that the goal system capitalizes on existing brain architectures for (reward) prediction errors and reuses it in an open-ended way. In a similar vein, Passingham and Wise (2012) discuss the adaptive advantages of the more advanced (prefrontal) goal systems. They argue that the (new) prefrontal areas of anthropoid primates extended the (older) reinforcement-learning system, increasing its flexibility and adaptability; for example, by generating (foraging) goals from single learning episodes. The resulting architecture for motivated behaviour frees higher animals from the immediate demands of homeostatic regulation. While this may predispose to maladaptive behaviour, it also permits an open-ended proliferation of goals and desires that characterize our human lives – because, as Baruch de Espinoza puts it, ‘‘desire is the essence of a man’’. 5. Simplified functional anatomy of hierarchical Active Inference A simplified functional anatomy for the hierarchical Active Inference scheme that we have discussed is shown in Fig. 8 . This should be considered as a schematic that organizes ideas about the functional anatomy underlying active or embodied inference. This sort of scheme should not be considered as a comprehensive characterization of functional brain architectures: many compnents are depicted very simplistically – and some brain areas are not discussed at all. However, it may be useful as a general framework about the functional neural organization and as a working hypothesis for the interpretation and testing of empirical studies",

Here anatomical loops of increasing complexity are proposed to embody the ‘gradient’ of control discussed earlier, with the more elaborated goal-directed control loops that contextualize the more elemental sensorimotor constructs within generative models of increasing hierarchical depth. The different levels of the Active Inference hierarchy are represented by a colour gradient from violet (the highest level: prefrontal cortex, PFC), red (supplemental motor area, SMA; Inferotemporal cortex, IC; anterior insular cortex, AIC), orange (premotor/motor cortex, PMC/MC; striatum; ipothalamus, ipoT) to yellow (autonomous nervous system, ANS; motoneurons). Connections among areas represent recurrent projections between areas that follow the usual logic of predictive coding , where backward connections convey descending predictions and forward connections pass prediction errors. Hierarchically higher areas play a more prominent role in the goal-directed system, whereas orange areas predominate in the Pavlovian and habitual systems. The central position assigned to prefrontal areas at the apex of the goal-directed system is in accordance with a large literature highlighting its importance for flexible cognitive control and executive function ( Fuster, 1997; Miller and Cohen, 2001 ). Evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that contextual representations of increasing abstration and timescale are processed along a posterior-anterior axis in PFC, suggesting that this region itself is hierarchically organized ( Koechlin and Summerfield, 2007 ).

This corresponds in our model to the fact that the exteroceptive network (including SMA, IC, striatum, MC and motoneurons – bold circles) is anatomically segregated from the interoceptive network (including AIC, ipoT and the ANS – dotted circles), but the two are integrated at the multimodal highest level in the PFC, see Fig. 2 and Gu et al. (2013) . Goal-directed control also requires knowledge of the contingencies between actions and outcomes ( Balleine and Dickinson, 1998 ). This form of knowledge is encoded in various ways – and at increasingly longer timescales – in motor, premotor, and prefrontal brain areas, which overall form hierarchical control loops. Another brain structure with a primary role in goal-directed control is IC and the closely related hippocampus. The ability of the hippocampus to support goal-directed learning and behaviour has been studied principally in spatial navigation ( Buzsa ́ki and Moser, 2013 ), but evidence suggests that this area also supports other advanced cognitive abilities that require prospection, such as G. Pezzulo et al. / Progress in Neurobiology 134 (2015) 17–35 29 imagination of fictive scenarios ( Hassabis and Maguire, 2009 ). From the associative learning perspective, the hippocampus has been linked to a form of instrumental process called ‘episodic’ control. Specifically, the hippocampus is thought to store stataction sequences that successfully attain a goal and then replay those sequences when a constituent state is encountered ( Lengyel and Dayan, 2008 ). This ability to generate fictive sequences of states ( Johnson and Redish, 2007; Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013 ) has been interpreted in terms of reactivation in the context of generative models ( Penny et al., 2013; Pezzulo et al., 2014a, 2013 )",

Furthermore, the hippocampus has been consistently linked to memory consolidation ( Buzsa ́ki, 1996 ), a role that can be characterized within Active Inference as the reporting of the expected information, precision and novelty of sequential events ( Strange et al., 2005 ). In short, the hippocampus is an important nexus for both the expression of goal-directed behaviour (possibly via the covert replay of previous experiences encoded in the generative models) and its acquisition (possibly by signalling the opportunity to optimize or revise generative models). In the hierarchical architecture depicted here, brain structures controlling more complex strategies – that are mandated by goadirected behaviour and cognitive control – do not replace more ancient brain structures underlying the simpler strategies based on fixed stimulus-response pairs, but contextualize them. In this way, more elaborate forms of action control orchestrate more elemetary sensorimotor architectures that support situated action or affordance competition ( Cisek and Kalaska, 2010 ). In the present scheme, this may involve cortical (motor and premotor) and subcortical regions, such as the striatum and hypothalamus. A widespread view is that different striatal territories (coupled with limbic, associative and sensorimotor cortex) participate in distinct cortico-subcortical loops – limbic, associative, and sensorimotor, respectively – and support different aspects of behavioural control ( Yin and Knowlton, 2006 ). For example, the dorsolateral striatum is thought to be more involved in stimuluresponse learning and habitual control, the dorsomedial striatum has been linked to action-outcome learning and goal-directed action, and ventral striatum to Pavlovian values ( Glascher et al., 2010; Liljeholm and O’Doherty, 2012; Mannella et al., 2013; O’Doherty et al., 2004 ). In a related perspective, these striatal territories might compute outcome predictions in parallel using different kinds of information as input ( Pennartz et al., 2011 )",

In this perspective, the model-based vs. model-free dichotomy is replaced by a more nuanced view, in which striatal territories embody different predictors (or models): from the more complex outcome predictions in ventral and dorsomedial striatum (analgous to model-based mechanisms), to the simpler predictions about actions based on somatosensory and motor information in the dorsolateral striatum (analogous to model-free mechanisms). The idea that different striatal territories support different aspects of behavioural control is coherent with the Active Inference scheme where generative models are not purely cortical structures but involve cortico-subcortical loops. In the perspective pursued here, however, the striatal subdivision is conceived as in hierarchical terms, rather than in terms of competition among parallel controllers or predictors. This hierarchical view of striatal computation is indeed supported by recent neurophysiological evidence ( Ito and Doya, 2015 ). Fig. 8.

The lower-middle panel shows the loops between cortical and subcortical brain areas at different hierarchical levels, which include loops between nucleus accumbens/ventral striatum and orbital/ventral PFC; between caudate/dorsomedial striatum and prefrontal/parietal association cortices; and between putamen/dorsolateral striatum and sensorimotor cortices ( Yin and Knowlton, 2006 ).

Embodied views of cognition suggest that the re-enactment of the same perceptual-motor loops – and internally generated brain dynamics – might realize increasingly complex cognitive functions such as planning, imagery, and conscious thought ( Buzsa ́ki et al., 2014; Grush, 2004; Hesslow, 2002; Jeannerod, 2001; Pezzulo, 2011; Pezzulo and Castelfranchi, 2009 ).

These infrastructures constitute the basic building blocks to enact arc reflexes and are exploited and contextualized by the higher hierarchical levels. It is worth noting that in the Active Inference scheme, motor areas represent proprioceptive predictions and not motor commands (as tradtionally assumed), in the same way as sensory (e.g., visual) areas represent exteroceptive predictions ( Adams et al., 2013 ). Motneurons are responsible for activating arc reflexes that fulfil these predictions, thus guiding overt action. They are thus the locus where predictions are unpacked in a kinematic frame of reference and transformed into overt action. In addition to the higher-to-lower control hierarchy, the Active Inference scheme requires an attentional network that modulates the relative precision of different levels in the hierarchy. In Fig. 8 this role has been assigned to the blue areas (anterior cingulate cortex, ACC; posterior parietal cortex, PPC; and the dopaminergic ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, VTA/SN). We hypothesize that ACC and PPC (linked preferentially with higher order areas through recurrent connections) are involved in modulating the relative precision of PFC relative to lower level areas; whereas VTA/SN (projecting widely to all other areas) is more important in regulating the precision of exteroceptive and interoceptive sensations (blue connections). The attentional network has an important role in the balance between more cognitively complex goals and more elementary ones, maintained at different hierarchical levels, which is an important hallmark of cognitive control ( Fuster, 1997; Miller and Cohen, 2001 ). Here, cognitive control entails a high degree of precision of ‘‘higher’’ areas such as PFC, so that more cognitively complex and long-term goals dominate the inference ( Pezzulo, 2012; Stoianov et al., 2015 )",

However, in some cases, such as in drug addiction, some aspects of prefrontal function decline and the agent becomes unable to contextualize or suppress (hierarchically lower) cortico – dorsal striatum loops that implement habits ( Belin et al., 2009 ). In sum, we propose a hierarchical neural architecture that extends from cortical areas to peripheral reflexes. This hierarchy is organized according to the level of abstraction of representations embodied by the different areas. The neural architecture is based on predictive coding , which constitutes a Bayesian inference machine that guides both perception and action. 5.1. Empirical evidence supporting the proposed framework and novel predictions Active Inference rests upon, and extends, a predictive coding scheme, which provides an explanation for many aspects of functional brain architectures. In brief, it explains the hierarchical nature of cortical connections; the prevalence of backward connections and explains many of the functional and structural asymmetries in the extrinsic (between region) connections that link hierarchical levels ( Zeki and Shipp, 1988 ). These asymmetries include the laminar specificity of forward and backward connetions, the prevalence of nonlinear or modulatory backward connections (that embody interactions and nonlinearities inherent in the generation of sensory signals) and their spectral characteistics ( Adams et al., 2013; Bastos et al., 2012; Friston, 2008 ). The specific evidence for predictive coding in the motor system is reviewed in ( Shipp et al., 2013 ). The studies mentioned above all provide some indirect support to the framework for adaptive behavioural control proposed here, which implements the plausible predictive coding and Active Inference schemes. Furthermore, this new framework allows to explain previous evidence and to make novel predictions that rest on our central premise; namely, that habitual and goal-directed behaviours are context-sensitive expressions of the same hierachical (active) inference",

In other words, by definition, habitual behaviours become habitised by virtue of selecting low-level hierarchical contingencies to make proprioceptive and interocetive predictions that induce behaviour. The selection rests upon modulatory (gain) control that we presume is reflected in dopaminergic activity. Therefore, neuromodulatory (e.g., dopamnergic) systems should be responsible for hierarchical selection – or mixture – of goal directed or habitual behaviour. Empirical studies suggest that dopaminergic projections are divergent and modulate, in a complementary fashion, higher and lower hierarchical levels of executive (corticostriatal-thalamic) processing. Our proposal that dopamine encodes the relative precision of the different hierarchical levels fits with such evidence. This divergence and modulatory aspect has been discussed under RL models ( O’Doherty et al., 2015 ). However, we stress that, in the current view, dopamine does not encode reward prediction errors but the precision of prediction errors at various levels of a hierarchy. Because precision is a ubiquitous attribute of all (hierarchically deployed) prediction errors, its computation and broadcasting mandates a convergent-divergent neuroanatomy and a modulatory neurophysiology. Because, in Active Inference, optimization rests upon reciprocal message passing, dopaminergic reference to multiple hierarchical levels must be reciprocated by (monosynaptic or polysynaptic) afferents from these regions. Although other schemes for hierarchical control have been proposed that use belief precisions or related constructs to modulate the balance of model based and model free controllers ( Daw et al., 2005; Gershman and Daw, 2012; Lee et al., 2014; Pezzulo et al., 2013 ), there are some unique features of the Active Inference scheme that make novel and empirically testable hypotheses",

    "chunk_text": ". For example, in Active Inference, but not in the aforementioned models, the optimal value of the precision parameter (in terms of free energy minimization) is computed on-line as part of inference. Furthermore, this precision controls the degree of ‘‘exploration’’ of the system, because, formally, it corresponds to the temperature parameter of softmax choice rules. In other words, the degree of exploration is derived from first principles rather than being tuned to behaviour as an ad hoc parameter. This feature of the model entails the novel prediction that a higher precision or confidence in their behavioural plans makes animals less exploratory and thus ultimately produces more stereotyped responses, which again speaks to habitisation. By the same token, exploration is favoured by the presence in the environment of cues that have epistemic value and can improve the precision of the behavioural policies ( Friston et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, an idea specific to our framework is that habitual and goal-directed behaviour form a continuum rather than a strict dichotomy, and can cooperate rather than just compete. Consistent with this view, recent behavioural and neural evidence supports the idea that at any given moment action selection results from a mixture of goal-directed and habitual control, rather than being under the exclusive control of either of the two systems ( Daw et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2014; Otto et al., 2013 ). Although these data can still be interpreted as resulting from two systems working in G. Pezzulo et al. / Progress in Neurobiology 134 (2015) 17–35 31 parallel and competing at a later stage, a much simpler explanation is the idea of a unitary hierarchy scheme in which the different levels correspond to specific degrees of complexity",

    "chunk_text": ". In this perspective, here the novelty of the proposal lies in the architectural scheme itself, which does not foresee multiple or even modularized controllers that perform heterogeneous computations plus an arbitration mechanism, but a unique architecture that performs homogeneous computations at all hierarchical levels. Strictly speaking, in the proposed scheme, habitual behaviour is not completely model free in that it continues to depend on the (simplest) type of predictive model, of the kind ‘‘because there is a stimulus, I expect a response’’. In Active Inference, it is the expected response that enslaves action, thus even these simple responses are prediction-based. Neurophysiologically, this is compatible with the view that the dorsolateral striatum, which has been long associated with habitual control, encodes simple models that generate predictions based on the animal’s somatsensory and motor information ( Pennartz et al., 2011 ). This scheme lends itself to a straightforward hierarchical extension, in which simpler models can be successively contextualized and can incorporate elements of goal-directedness, but only when more complex models at the higher hierarchical levels have sufficient precision to exert an influence. In other words, in this scheme there is no need to see habitual and goal-directed behaviours as regulated by distinct or modular processes. The key ethological insight afforded by hierarchical Active Inference is that all behaviours are hierarchically contextualized. Not only does this predict that goal-directed and habitual responses can be mixed, but also the specific conditions where this should occur. For example, it predicts that responses should fail to be contextualized – and thus become more habitual – when the system is ‘taxed’ by concurrent cognitively demanding tasks, a phenomenon that has been often interpreted in terms of reinforcement learning theories ( Gershman et al., 2014; Otto et al., 2013 )",

    "chunk_text": ". Furthermore, it predicts that under certain conditions habitual behaviour can cease to be purely ‘model free’, thereby disclosing evidence of its context sensitivity. For example, phenomena like extinction and the context-dependent reactivtion of extinguished associations can be explained in terms of the (hierarchical) selection of learned associations at different periods of exposure to the environment. For example, the extinction of a conditioned response (say, a conditioned response of hunger and salivation following the sound of a bell) would not derive from an attenuation of the sounfood association, but from the fact that the response can be contextualized by a (higher) mechanism that learns how the probability of food availability depends on the sound, in different contexts. In the same way, the response can be reactivated when the right contextual conditions are detected, thus providing the top-down mechanisms enough precision to influence or overcome any behavioural habit developed in the interim; see also ( Gallistel, 2012 ). Another set of predictions stem from the idea that action selection and initiation depends on (multimodal) prediction errors, not only stimuli. This view is compatible with a large body of evidence in the ideomotor theory, according to which actions, including those that are as simple as button presses (as used in most human studies), are planned and selected based on their anticipated effects ( Hoffmann, 2003; Hommel et al., 2001; Kunde, 2001, 2003; Prinz, 1997 ; Schuetz-Bosbach and Prinz, 2007 ). By expanding this framework to consider a role for interoceptive (not only exteroceptive or proprioceptive) prediction errors, it may be possible to address the link between interoceptive states and action selection and initiation, which is currently under-explored in the animal learning literature",

Two caveats for experimental studies investigating this link would be the largely anticipatory nature of interoceptive events and the fact the relations between actions and interoceptive consequences can be distal and mediated by other (exteroceptive or proprioceptive) events, see Section 3.1 . To summarize, in this section we have presented a range of empirical predictions that stem from our framework. Some of these predictions are unique to this framework and could serve to disambiguate it from alternatives. Other predictions, have been addressed under other normative perspectives; most notably, reinforcement learning. Perhaps the most important (novel) contribution of our proposal is that it accommodates multifarious phenomena, which have been addressed using different – and often incompatible – computational approaches. Furthermore, the framework can call upon specific process theories that are biologically plausible; for example, predictive coding and cybenetic schemes ( Friston, 2010 ). In other words, there is the potential for an explicit connection between the normative (approximate Bayesian inference) level and the processes underlying neurobilogical implementation. 6. Conclusions In this article, we have cast ‘‘homoeostasis’’ and ‘‘behavioural control’’ in terms of Active Inference. Under this perspective, drive and goal achievement mandate the suppression of prediction errors of different kinds (interoceptive, proprioceptive, and exteroceptive) within a hierarchical architecture, and their resolution through action. The underlying computations are driven by a unique imperative: free energy minimization. However, when the same free energy minimization is expressed in different conditions (e.g., before, during or after learning of generative models) they produce different forms of behavioural control that correspond to reflexes, conditional responses and goal-directed behaviour",

    "chunk_text": ". This paper establishes a link between Active Inference and associative learning theories of animal behaviour, with potential benefits for both. On the one hand, the link extends the scope of Active Inference to the self-regulation of bodily (as opposed to sensorimotor) states and interoceptive inference ( Pezzulo, 2013; Seth et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, the link with animal learning theories clarifies the nature of hierarchical inference. For example, empirical priors in generative models correspond to ‘‘drives’’ and ‘‘goals’’ in the animal learning literature – despite the fact they are called ‘‘beliefs’’ in the Bayesian brain literature. We have suggested that an initial set of priors might correspond to Pavlovian values shaped by evolution, while others are acquired by learning generative models. On the other hand, the connection with Active Inference suggests that the behavioural controllers proposed in the animal learning literature might be seen as the successive contextualization of simpler sensorimotor mechanisms in hierachical generative models. This view emphasises an inclusive and unified view of functional brain architectures, rather than a collection of distinct and separable modules. The homeostatic view proposed here clarifies why Active Inference agents are not plagued by the (infamous) ‘‘dark room’’ problem ( Friston et al., 2012b ). Homeostatic regulation implies a continuous update of empirical priors for action, whose dynamics are dictated by the uninterrupted flux of interoceptive message passing between brain and body. This flux incessantly supplies new set points or goals – and a ‘‘moving target’’ for behaviour. Thus, any organism equipped with a body must face reality rather than live in a darkened room. It is exactly in this sense that ( Pavlov, 2010 ) argues that the brain provides the interface between the internal milieu of the body and the external milieu of the environment",

In other words, the interoceptive state is what organisms try to maintain within a viable range – because departures can be dangerous. Exteroceptive states are conserved, provided this sufficient to keep interoceptive states in a physiological range – but here more variability and G. Pezzulo et al. / Progress in Neurobiology 134 (2015) 17–35 32 ‘‘exploration’’ is allowed. Maintaining this delicate balance is an important constraining factor for any robust control system, biological or artificial. Our analysis also grounds the abstract computations of free energy minimization as described in theoretical neuroscience ( Friston, 2010 ). It suggests that free energy can be minimized at multiple timescales: evolutionary for Pavlovian values, lifelong learning for instrumental control (in particular habitual control), and on-line search-based computations for goal-directed control. In this perspective, the same free energy computations that optimize on-line action might also be used to describe how brain structure is optimized during evolution to embody an organism’s needs and how it is adapted during development to retain useful (habitual) strategies and to increase the precision of lower hierarchical layers. These elements are all implicated in free energy principle but here we provide a new perspective on the mechanisms supporting that minimization and the timescales at which they operate. Our review of different approaches to behavioural control highlights that some terms are used in different ways; for example, the concept of ‘‘value’’. In the homeostatic view pursued here, value is the complement of surprise or prediction error (because maintaining homeostasis is ‘‘valuable’’). This implies that any state or action can have an associated value if it links, directly or indirectly, to the minimization of prediction error",

    "chunk_text": ". This implies that any state or action can have an associated value if it links, directly or indirectly, to the minimization of prediction error. Essentially, all adaptive systems should pursue value through action in some way. It is important to note that although value computations are implemented differently in different systems, they essentially use the same logic, which defines the normative aspect of these behaviours. In most homeostatic theories, the value is pursued directly by engaging (Pavlovian) innate approach or avoidance actions. In reinforcement learning, for instance a temporadifference reward prediction error is used to train (habitual) controllers that can be considered a proxy for achieving a certain ‘‘reward’’, which is in turn a proxy for restoring good homeostatic values. In episodic controllers, action sequences that lead to reinforcement are stored and re-enacted in similar circumstances. In Active Inference, free energy minimization can either consider sensory prediction errors directly, or do so indirectly by consideing proxies (e.g., prediction errors at higher levels of hierarchical models that link sensory prediction errors over modalities and time). In short, all these approaches rest on similar or even identical value computations, but differ in specific aspects of their mechanistic interpretation and implementation. Understanding the computational and neuronal basis of motivated behaviour is a key objective of many disciplines including psychology, neuroscience, and (neuro)economics. The framework offered here provides principled and mechanistic hypotheses about how the basic brain design of simpler animals might have been reused and extended through generative models and, while retaining essential embodied aspects, permits higher animals to achieve open-ended goals.

This review focuses on the aspects that uniquely characterize MEG. We emphasize the specific strengths of the modality, such as its source imaging capabilities. We also identify and discuss practical challenges, in particular in signal extraction and interpretation. Because MEG and electroencephalography (EEG) appear to be sister electrophysiological techniques that are both sensitive to the electrochemical current flows within and between brain cells, MEG is sometimes thought to be equivalent to EEG, with limited scientific added value. We refute this misconception and explain how distinct physical principles make these two modalities complementary in many respects, rather than purely redundant. In particular, we argue that MEG is the modality with the best combination of direct and noninvasive access to the electrophysiological activity of the entire brain, with sub-millisecond temporal resolution and ability to resolve activity between cerebral regions with often surprising spatial and spectral differentiation and minimum bias. Indeed, unlike EEG, the accuracy of MEG source mapping is immune to the signal dis­ tortions caused by the complex layering of head tissues, with highly heterogeneous conductivity profiles that cannot be measured with precision in vivo . We explore these ideas herein in details and conclude that MEG, used independently or in combination with other brain imaging tech­ niques, contributes uniquely to our deeper comprehension of both the regional and large-scale neural dynamics of the brain: from the clarification of the nature of spontaneous and event-related brain activation to the elucidation of the mechanisms that yield functional connectivity between regions and the emergence of modes of network communication in brain systems",

Along the way, while we discuss limitations, current difficulties and uncertainties asso­ ciated with the technique, we also wish to correct some mistaken perceptions of MEG. Measurement principles and instrumentation The basic principles of MEG are simple; the sophistication lies in the sensing technology involved and the methodology required to extract relevant signal information in the widest variety of experi­ mental contexts. Fundamentally, any electrical current produces magnetic induction (often popularly confounded with a magnetic field 4 ), whose strength can be measured remote from the current source—for example, with a pick-up coil. The magnetic flux across the coil surface induces an electrical current in the coil wiring mate­ rial, whose amplitude is instantaneously proportional to that of the magnetic induction and is readily measurable. Basic signal origins. In MEG, the electrochemical currents circulat­ ing within and between neurons generate the magnetic induction. Postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) are considered the main generators of these ionic currents 3,5 .

In practical terms, the magnetic signal produced by neural currents in the nanoampere (10 −9 A) range is formidably weak. Extracranial magnetic inductions are typically measured on a scale of femtoteslas (10 −15 T), about 10 to 100 million times smaller than the Earth’s static magnetic field. This reality imposes a need for sensitive sensor technology. The present industry standards rely on pick-up coils coupled with superconducting interference devices (SQUIDs) 2,3 . SQUIDs exploit the principles of quantum physics for the detection of small electrical currents, like those induced by weak mag­ netic signals, with high sensitivity and large dynamic ranges. State-of-the-art commercial systems feature coil magnetometers arranged in whole-head arrays of about 300 independent channels, sampled at up to 30 kHz simultaneously. Magnetic induction travels through the air: MEG sensors are not attached to the scalp, as the entire sensing apparatus is embedded in a thermally insulated tank, called a dewar, filled with 70–100 L of liquid helium. Superconducting temperatures minimize thermal noise and therefore optimize data quality. Consequently, subject preparation times are much shorter than in EEG, as the contactless and gel-free sensors do not need to be positioned and carefully verified manually. Another distinctive property of MEG is that magnetic induction is a vector signature of electrodynamics. In concrete terms, MEG sig­ nals depend on the location and orientation of the pick-up coils with respect to neural sources, which vary between system manufacturers and are relative to the subject’s head position in the helmet. This represents a clear practical difference from EEG, which meas­ ures differences of scalar electrical potentials between electrodes attached to the scalp",

Although the head’s shape and size obviously vary between individuals, the standardization of electrode montages scaled to the individual anatomy and with a common nomenclature 11 has greatly contributed to streamlining the dissemination and com­ parison of EEG results between instruments, studies and individual subjects, including patients. In MEG, both the monitoring of head movements during data acquisition and the registration of head posi­ tions between participants are therefore important factors for data quality and comparison, respectively. Besides online video monitoring of subjects, all MEG systems feature real-time measurements of head position. Limited offline software solutions for head movement com­ pensation are available and can be necessary with special populations, such as infants 12 . Creative hardware solutions have been recently proposed, using adjustable head casts to consistently reposition the subject within and between sessions with millimeter accuracy 13 . Also unlike EEG data, MEG measures are reference-free: magnetic induction values are not relative to a common measure. The measure­ ment of absolute physical quantities is an asset of MEG. In principle, though, EEG datasets can always be re-referenced with respect to their instantaneous arithmetic mean as a form of standardization 14 . Furthermore, the dependence of MEG signal strength on head position mitigates the advantage of collecting reference-free quanti­ ties. We shall see below that source imaging obviates the limitations attached to sensor data analysis and affords one specific strength of MEG with respect to EEG.

Fortunately, emerging opportunities for more cost-effective solutions bode well of the long-term sustainability and greater affordability of MEG as a research tool. Helium-based cryogenics are constantly threatened by a looming shortage in natural resources. Hence the development of alterna­ tive sensing and instrument technology is vital to MEG, as well as other high-end instruments such as MRI scanners. Practical onsite helium recycling solutions have emerged and approach 90% efficacy. They reduce weekly refills to one or two per year. Still, thermal insu­ lation negatively affects the sensitivity of the instrument: sensors are separated from the head surface by a distance of at least 2 cm. Recent integration of SQUID sensors in a partially adjustable helmet is a true breakthrough, improving signal strength and encouraging developmental neuroscience MEG research 15 . New sensing technology is maturing. Non-cryogenic HyQUID detectors with noise performance equivalent to that of traditional SQUIDs is already found in a commercially available system. Similarly, optically pumped magnetometers 16 (OPM) based on radi­ cally different sensing physics principles also represent an alternative to SQUID-based technology. Although less sensitive, OPMs can be positioned directly on the scalp surface and therefore pick up stronger field strengths as they are brought closer to the brain 17 . OPMs are very cost-effective, which also bodes well for easier access and therefore greater adoption of MEG by more neuroscientists. The extreme sensitivity of present and future MEG sensing tech­ nology is challenged by many electromagnetic nuisance sources.

( a ) For simplicity, we take the cortical pyramidal neuron to epitomize the elementary cellular generator of MEG signals. All physiological currents from all cell types generate a magnetic induction; the elongated morphology of the pyramidal neuron constrains the net primary current circulation along the cell, which is a factor in creating greater signal strength in comparison to those from more stellate cellular morphologies. The primary current results from an imbalance in electrical potentials between the apical dendritic arborescence of the cell and its soma and more basal dendrites. The magnetic induction isolines in purple are perpendicular to the primary current flow and can be picked up outside the head. The sources are twofold: the postsynaptic potentials (PSPs), including fast, large-amplitude sodium spikes, and axonal discharges (action potentials, AP). The slower components of the PSPs are substantially smaller in amplitude than the APs. ( b ) At the scale of cell assemblies, the mass effect of slower PSPs is stronger than that of APs owing to their greater overlap in time without requiring rigorous synchronization. Computational models and empirical evidence show that a minimum of 10,000 to 50,000 cells are required to produce a signal detectable with MEG 8 .

The best solution remains the installation of a heavy (20-ton), multilayered shielding room to host the MEG instrument. However, this represents about a quarter of the investment cost and can be difficult to site. Lighter and slightly more compact shielding solutions based on the active shielding technology are possible alternatives. Finally and remarkably, MEG sensing technology can be used to detect magnetic resonance phenomena at ultralow fields (in the 10–100 mT range). In addition to special magnetic resonance–related advantages, there are potential benefits in such all-in-one hybrid imaging technology: combined MRI and MEG can be obtained simultaneously, thereby limiting registration errors 18 . Yet the lower magnetization induces weaker signal strength and imposes longer magnetic resonance acquisition times. It remains unclear whether this technology will truly penetrate neuroscience applications. Distinct capabilities for electrophysiology and imaging MEG as a method of electrophysiology. In featuring channels arrays around the head and sensor signals originating from brain physi­ ological currents, MEG and EEG are sister techniques for noninva­ sive electrophysiology.

This misconcep­ tion has been exacerbated by the fact that to obtain measurable mark­ ers of brain activity, early MEG studies and even many recent ones have resorted to the signal extraction techniques of EEG, averaging multiple trials of sensor signals time-locked to specific stimulus or behavioral events 11 . The fact that both the timing and spatial prop­ erties of the resulting event-related fields (ERFs) are only partially consistent with the extensively studied nomenclature of event-related potentials (ERPs) cannot be interpreted in favor of or against MEG or EEG. If we imagine that ERFs were entirely concordant with ERPs, shall we conclude that MEG is simply redundant with EEG? If ERF counterparts of ERPs are absent, does this mean ERPs are actually artifactual? This apparent discordance is also true for the power and spatial distribution of sensor signals in the typical frequency bands of electrophysiology (delta, theta, alpha, etc.; see below). To understand why MEG and EEG are actually different and com­ plementary techniques for observing the electrical activity of the brain, we need to go back to Maxwell electrodynamics 4,5 . These rules show that the spatial topography of magnetic induction and electrical potentials created by the same current source depend very differently on key factors. First and foremost, EEG signals are primarily and strongly affected by the substantial difference in electrical conduc­ tivity between the scalp, skull and other biological tissues. Magnetic permittivity, the magnetic equivalent of conductivity, is homogenous and identical across all compartments, including the air between the scalp and sensors. Consequently, the spatial topography of MEG sen­ sor data is visually and quantitatively less smeared and distorted than that of EEG electrical potentials produced by the same physiological brain sources",

It also helps separate the contributions of brain signals from ambiguous physiological contaminants, such as ocular microsaccades 21 and muscular artifacts 22,23 , which can be confounded with high-frequency brain signals in EEG but are more clearly distinguished on the basis of their distinctive sensor topogra­ phy with MEG. Artifact components can be eliminated or corrected when good-practice guidelines are respected 24 . The laws of physics however, impose a different set of challenges on MEG.

MEG is also less sensitive to neural current flows with a radial orien­ tation—that is, those aligned along a virtual radius of the head, from its center to the scalp envelope. Here too, the conception that MEG is entirely blind to radial sources would actually be valid only if the shape of the head were a perfect sphere 5 . For all these reasons, and if we assume that brain activity, including the sources of event-related components, involves regions present­ ing a variety of depths and current flow orientations, there can be at best limited correspondence between MEG and EEG sensor data. We also need to bear in mind that these modalities actually meas­ ure different, nonredundant physical quantities. Consequently, direct comparison studies between the femtoteslas of MEG and the microvolts of EEG sensor data can prove more challenging than ini­ tially thought",

The appreciation of converging or complementary evidence between the techniques can be best conducted by assessing their respective abilities to resolve the physiological currents at their source, as discussed below. Yet we also need to acknowledge that many neuroscience questions may not require brain mapping: there is established and continued scientific interest in and clinical significance for MEG sensor data analyses, in their ability to discriminate between experimental condi­ tions, including with spatial-filtering 25 and decoding techniques 26 , and to correlate with or predict behavior 27 . They also suggest sim­ ple and practical new disease markers 28 . We re-emphasize, however, that the anatomical interpretation of scalp signals remains ambig­ uous, even in MEG. The cross-talk between sensors due to signal smearing represents a source of severe confounds, especially to func­ tional connectivity measures 29 applied to scalp data. Source imaging can alleviate these issues. MEG as an imaging modality. Relatively to EEG, the advanced sensing technology involved in MEG has attracted the continued interest and expertise of the physics and electrical engineering community. This influence manifests in approaching source localization and imaging as inverse modeling, a category of problems common to many subfields of applied physics and biomedical imaging 5 . Indeed, one truly distinctive advantage of MEG is arguably in producing time-resolved maps of neu­ ral currents that are considerably less prone to distortion by modeling approximations than EEG. There is strong evidence that EEG source models suffer from uncontrolled biases caused by inevitable approxi­ mations in defining the head shape 30 , especially the bone of the skull 31 . The presence of blood vessels also affects EEG source modeling 32",

More generally, the conductivity of head tissues remains in practice unmeas­ urable in vivo 33,34 , and the approximated values used also impose a localization and amplitude bias on estimated EEG sources 35,36 ( Fig. 2 ). Further approximations in modeling the electrode size and drifts in skin-contact impedances also contribute negatively 37 . Ground-truth direct-comparison studies of MEG and EEG source localization, using electrical sources implanted in realistic skull phan­ toms 38,39 , confirms the greater sensitivity of EEG to model approxi­ mations. Localization errors of up to 25 mm were produced by EEG source modeling, while the maximum MEG localization bias was limited to about 1 cm under the same experimental circumstances. Multimodal comparison studies taking fMRI as reference tend to show lesser differences 40 , especially when simultaneously recorded MEG and EEG data is processed jointly to yield, in principle, a supe­ rior, superadditive joint source model of cortical generators 41,42 . Therefore, whenever possible, a good-practice guideline is to record from at least a few EEG electrodes simultaneously with MEG. This augments the chances of obtaining converging evidence about the underlying brain processes. Box 1 Toward increased clinical adoption The actual value of clinical MEG for epilepsy is now well documented and argued, with large-volume retrospective studies reporting on the level of agreement between the noninvasive test and standard-of-care approaches (for example, invasive EEG) in severe cases 113,132,133 . Yet retrospective studies are also limited by design: if MEG is concordant with invasive tests, then it is deemed as good as the latter; if it is discordant and points at other possibly epileptogenic brain regions, results need to be carefully assessed depending on whether interventions based on the standard-of-care data actually led to long-term freedom from seizures",

Ideally, multicenter prospective trials of MEG predictions would need to be conducted, with intracra­ nial explorations guided in part by MEG source imaging, followed by surgical resections, to fully assess the insight provided by MEG. Other practical limitations include the very duration of present MEG tests. These are typically limited to hour-long recordings to minimize cost and maximize patient comfort. This is often very short for capturing canonical epileptiform events such as interictal spikes and, even more rarely, seizures, which are still considered of the highest value for clinical diagnosis. Tests are also often performed as outpatient procedures, with patients on medication, which further reduces the yield in terms of epileptiform events. Considering a patient brain as constantly under siege by a neurological or neuropsychiatric disorder, clinical MEG research needs to point at other possible markers of aberrant ongoing or stimulus-response brain activity as alternative expressions of disease. A considerable body of work in autism spectrum disorder indicates that simple MEG measures of delayed early auditory responses, easily implementable in the clinic, are indicative of the syndrome’s severity 28,115 and are concordant with magnetic resonance tractography and with predisposing gene dosage 134 . Altered expression of background brain rhythms represents another source of electrophysiological MEG markers that remains relatively uncharted. This is an opportunity for MEG clinical research to verify the promises of animal research and diseases models in the great variety of insults and disorders that affect the human brain 135–137 . Such research can only benefit from the consolidation and growing availability of large databanks of control MEG volumes, to help identify how these new disease markers deviate from normative variants 84 ( Fig. 4 )",

MEG is clinically prescribed and reimbursed in a few countries for specific indications, such as pharmacologically intractable epilepsy and presurgi­ cal functional mapping of brain tumors. We note in passing that clinical recognition, including reimbursement, for fMRI tests is still largely lacking as well. In principle, clinical demand will boost the number of installations and improve access for researchers, eventually closing the virtuous loop back to more clinical indications for MEG tests. This wishful scenario has not entirely happened yet: MEG clinical programs typically see anywhere between a dozen and a maximum of a couple of hundred epilepsy cases annually. This situation can pose challenges in terms of financial sustainability if not complemented by a critical mass of funded research studies or intramural institutional commitment. Brain tumor cases are rarely seen because MEG analysis pipelines remain time-consuming. This is a factor typically incompatible with the time pressures of clinical decision-making and surgical interventions in neuro-oncology. It is the present reality that, so far, MEG vendors have delivered beautifully crafted instruments without investing enough resources in developing truly efficient software analysis pipelines to serve the special needs of clinical practitioners. Productive MEG clinics are those who have invested in the brain power to compensate for these commercial lacunae. © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved. The sources of bias that are specific to MEG are well identified and controlled. The sensitivity and therefore the spatial resolution of MEG source imaging are indeed uneven across the brain: for instance, superficial cortical sources produce MEG signals up to 100 times stronger than deeper, subcortical structures at equivalent current strengths 43,44",

However, there is both modeling 45 and increasing experimental evidence that with optimized paradigm designs and signal extraction techniques, brain regions as deep as the insula 46 , thalamus 47 , hippocampus 48 , amygdala 49–51 and brainstem 52,53 can be resolved with MEG. Concerning the influence of current flow direction, brain regions in sulcal walls (tangential current flow) produce MEG signals that are stronger than sources along gyral crowns (radial current flow). We also emphasize that, SNR differential effects notwithstanding, the ori­ entation of primary currents affects positively the spatial resolution of MEG source imaging: recent empirical results in the visual cortex indi­ cate that the activity of cortical locations separated by about 0.5 mm can be resolved if the angle between their respective current flow is at least 45°, a range compatible with typical cortical gyrification 54 . These results confirm simulation studies that demonstrate the sensitivity of MEG signals to minute changes between cortical layers 55 and at the sub-millimeter scale of cortical columns 56 . All these factors influencing the sensitivity of MEG source imaging are fully characterized quantitatively from the physical forward model of an individual’s anatomy. SNR can also be estimated routinely using empty-room recordings, with no participant under the sensor array. This is another advantage of MEG with respect to EEG, for which actual skin contact of the electrodes is required. Nevertheless, with substantial operating costs and a capital invest­ ment that compares to that of an MRI scanner, a research organization needs further reasons to support the initiation and development of an MEG program. The comparison with MRI is relatively unfair: in the early years, a crucial factor that facilitated the development of MRI neuroimaging research was the fast-growing installation of clinical scanners that were also made partially available to researchers",

The clinical recommendation and recognition for MEG, although growing 57 ( Box 1 ), have not been sufficient yet to increase the number of clinical MEG units to a level that would facilitate access to the broadest research community. Hence, the decision to initiate and maintain an MEG program is a matter of institutional research strategy. The initiative needs to be supported by a sufficiently large and diverse critical mass of investigators intrigued by the assets of the technique. Financially, a clear plan needs to be laid out so that operating costs can be assumed by a combination of fees for access and institutional funds. Strategically, MEG imaging represents a strong scientific asset in the neuroscience portfolio of a research intensive institution: it is directly sensitive to neural electrophysiology and therefore independent of a signal transduction model. The millisecond temporal resolution of neural signal dynamics across the entire brain is obviously another hallmark of MEG compared to functional MRI (fMRI), positron emis­ sion tomography (PET) or optical techniques 58 . We have seen that multiple factors expose EEG imaging to uncontrolled sources of local­ ization bias. Other electrophysiological methods, such as intracranial stereotactic EEG and electrocorticographic implants, have obvious limitations in terms of invasiveness, and coverage of the cerebrum is confined to a limited number of disease-prone regions. Other practical advantages over in-bore scanning with PET and fMRI include a safe, quiet and open environment inducing minimal claustrophobic stress, especially in special populations, with posture adjustable anywhere between upright and supine.

MEG also offers remarkably versatile concurrent signal acquisition and analytic combination opportunities for the realization of genuine multimodal studies, with high-density scalp EEG 60,61 , intracranial local field potentials 62–64 , deep-brain 65,66 and scalp 67,68 current stimu­ lation devices; all kinds of peripheral measures to study their coupling with brain activity (eye tracking and pupil diameter, heart rate, skin conductance, muscle electrophysiology, motion capture, behavioral equipment, etc.); and real-time neurofeedback 69,70 . Reduced analytic complexity for greater adoption. One recurrent bottleneck to the broader adoption of MEG has been the perceived intricacies of its data workflow. The reasons are multifaceted ( Fig. 3 ). First, MEG signals are rich and complex: we will review in the next section how this is a matter of active research. Still, it also remains a source of uncertainty to MEG users. They therefore need to be offered the best possible guidance to define the signals of interest in their data and navigate the plethora of signal extraction measures avail­ able. A constructive stance is to encourage investigators to formulate their research hypotheses in terms of electrophysiological markers (for example, event-related responses, oscillatory components, crosfrequency interactions, inter-regional coherence, etc.) of mecha­ nisms related to a theoretical framework. Exploratory MEG studies are essentially bound to fail, considering the volume of data and the analysis dimensions enabled by MEG’s mass electrophysiology. Another element that has somewhat inhibited MEG’s development is that, as in EEG, the physics principles underlying source imaging are fundamentally ill-posed.

Like other brain imaging modalities, MEG requires that several important procedures be followed in data analytics. (1) The preprocessing steps are crucial to assure that data quality is optimal at the time of collection and before engaging sophisticated signal extraction procedures. Data segments contaminated by artifacts need to be identified and rejected or attenuated. (2) The modeling stage for MEG imaging requires that a few important options for parameters selection be considered carefully (for example, template versus individual head shape, noise definition, image reconstruction parameters). (3) Signal extraction usually depends on the design of the experiment and is very versatile in MEG.

Opportunities for machine learning and big-data neuroscience. New approaches to MEG signal analysis have recently spun off from the tremendous developments and growing availability of data clas­ sification and feature extraction techniques, based on the principles of machine learning 72 . These methods emerged only recently in the MEG arena, although they are already demonstrating very significant potential in augmenting the scientist’s toolkit. Relatively simple implementation of machine-learning decoding techniques for multidimensional signal classification showed impres­ sive applications in identifying early components of visual object categorization 73 and in tracking the temporal organization of spatial patterns of brain activity 74 or that of a mnemonic template in the context of perceptual decisions 75 . The fact that these methods are, for now, fairly independent of signal models make them an attractive complement to MEG researchers for rapid evaluation of their data— for example, to assess the presence and spatiotemporal topography of effects between experimental conditions or cohorts. Such approaches were recently and beautifully extended to joint multimodal process­ ing of MEG and fMRI data 76 : a form of machine learning–based conjunction analysis of similar representations of features in both datasets resulted in fMRI voxel clusters being animated with MEG’s millisecond temporal resolution",

More generally, resorting to big-data tools and methods is becoming increasingly strategic in neuroscience research involving brain imaging: analysis pipelines have grown in sophistication, and data volumes have inflated concurrently with the augmented spatial and temporal resolution of instruments. There is also a growing sci­ entific motivation to combine multiple data types (genotypes, imaging and behavioral phenotypes, clinical data, tissue samples, etc.), which transforms every research participant’s record in a big-data volume. In parallel, community awareness is now growing toward expanding the curated value and lifetime of data collections in public research: the increasing number of open data-sharing initiatives emphasize and incarnate stronger educational, economical, ethical and societal values in science 78 . For the neuroimaging community, this repre­ sents a vital opportunity to validate methods more thoroughly and to overcome the limitations of small-sample, low-powered and conse­ quently poorly reproducible studies that are eventually detrimental to the credibility of the field 79 . Until recently, MEG was lagging behind MRI in that respect 80–82 .

Fortunately, these bottlenecks are gradually, and at least partially, being overcome by the increasing availabil­ ity and versatility of software readers for most native data formats. Storage capacity, especially in the cloud, has now become ubiquitous and more affordable. The Human Connectome Project was first to distribute MEG data on a large scale, from a subsample of its cohort, along with extensive multimodal MRI, behavioral and genetic data 83 . With about 150 data volumes available, the Open MEG Archives (OMEGA) is the second-largest repository of resting-state MEG data, and it contains T1-weighted MRI volumes of participants 84 ( Fig. 4a ). The recent CAM-CAN initiative features data from about 650 healthy participants ages 18–88, combined with multimodal MRI and exten­ sive cognitive testing 85 . We rejoice that more of these initiatives are on the horizon, as they will with no doubt increasingly contribute to improving data integ­ rity and consistency across sites, reproducibility of research results, and the development and benchmarking of new analysis methods that were statistically too low powered with smaller data cohorts ( Fig. 4b ). Finally, flexible statistical inference methods based on non-parametric approaches have been designed to adequately han­ dle the multiple dimensions of MEG data (space, frequency and time, typically) and efficiently control for multiple comparisons in hypothesis testing 86,87 .

Is this noise? How to implement a test to detect signal changes between experimental conditions? How to meas­ ure functional connectivity? These interrogations are active research topics in MEG. They contribute to the broader objective of compre­ hending and exploiting how brain activation, in terms of regional and large-scale neural dynamics, is expressed in electrophysiology 88 . Yet many potential users of MEG are under the impression that the field is not mature enough or that the technique is too complicated alto­ gether. All things considered, these are questions that actually concern all electrophysiology and imaging methods: the apparent simplicity of fMRI data and of some widely used analysis pipelines, for instance, should not mask their intrinsic limitations 89,90 and the share of fragility in their methodological assumptions and sophistication 91 . MEG signals: rich and complex. Event-related components such as ERFs represent only a small fraction of the wealth of information present in MEG signals. One key scientific objective is indeed to understand how transient or tonic responses emerge from and reshape the busy resting-state activity of the brain 92,93 . This represents a conceptual, and somewhat iconoclastic, shift from the classical tradition of considering spontaneous, ongoing brain activity as ‘neural noise’",

It is necessary, though, to comprehend the rich expressions of distributed and interdependent neural dynam­ ics available in MEG signals and to make the most of the modality’s imaging capacity. Electrophysiology is not the only domain of biology undergoing a similar change of paradigm, exploiting the higher order statistics of experimental measures beyond the tradi­ tional trial or group average. Bridging with other imaging modalities and animal electrophysi­ ology contributes to a deeper comprehension of the nature of brain signals observed with MEG imaging 94 . For instance, the explosion of interest in fMRI resting-state and task-based connectomics prompts the identification of equivalent signaling mechanisms in neural elec­ trophysiology 95,96 . Counterintuitively, there is little correspondence between MEG and fMRI resting-state networks when MEG source signals are extracted in the frequency bands that show the strongest correlation between electrophysiology and fMRI, namely gamma 97,98 , Default-mode network Visual network A P R L a b Alpha: 8–12 Hz Beta: 15–25 Hz Gamma: 40–80 Hz Resting-state networks as modes of phase-amplitude coupling Dorsal, sensorimotor network Auditory+ network Modes of frequency-specific coherent activity Figure 5 Frequency-dependent expressions of inter-regional connectivity.

In fact, MEG time series in the beta range (15–35 Hz), when processed with fMRI-like data-driven resting-state pipelines, were first to reveal rest­ ing-state networks compatible with fMRI’s topography 100 . Studies had shown indeed that local field potentials in the beta band were weakly negatively correlated with blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) traces 99 . Gamma and the slower BOLD-correlated frequency bands (delta through alpha) were later shown to also form an electrophysi­ ological scaffold for resting-state networks 101 , when combined using cross-frequency coupling measures translated from animal and intracranial human electrophysiology 102 ( Figs. 5 and 6b ).

( a ) A typical power density spectrum (80-s resting-state data from a 55-year-old healthy adult with eyes open; Welch’s method, 2-s windowing) shows the distribution of power averaged across all 275 channels of a CTF MEG system. Typical brain rhythms are marked; note the prominent peak in power in the 8- to 12-Hz alpha range. ( b ) These rhythms are coupled and interdependent, which can be revealed by measures of cross-frequency interaction, such as phase–amplitude coupling (PAC). Here, PAC analysis of MEG traces obtained in the resting-state (10 min) of a healthy 40-year-old adult (eyes open) shows that the amplitude of gamma activity is modulated by the phase of slower oscillations. Each panel indicates (i) the average of ongoing MEG source time series epoched on a [–0.5, 0.5] s time window about the trough of the local slow oscillation the most highly coupled with fast gamma activity in the 80- to 150-Hz range and (ii) the average time–frequency decomposition of the power of the MEG source signal, indicating how it is modulated with the phase of the underlying oscillation (see ref. 101 for details).

( c ) The slower delta to alpha rhythms mark the net excitability of cell assemblies consisting of slow and fast inhibitory (SI and FI, respectively) and excitatory (E) cells. Possible theoretical frameworks for the organization of brain rhythms, such as the model of synchronized gating 101 and others 140,141 , consider brain network formation and communication to be enabled by the phase alignment of these cycles between regions. This can be facilitated by the mechanism of dynamical relaying 142 via the thalamus or cortical hub regions. While gamma bursts could contribute to bottom-up signaling (black arrows), beta bursts could manifest top-down modulations of upstream regions (magenta arrows) and thereby contribute to the implementation of contextual predictive inference of input signals. ( d ) Such a dynamical scaffold, among others possible, helps formulate testable hypotheses from MEG signals. For instance, the occurrence of a stimulus (input) interferes with the ongoing E/I dynamics in a primary sensory region. This may provoke the resetting of the phase of local E/I cycles and trigger the temporal prediction of the next stimulus occurrence via an afferent volley of beta oscillations. This process repeats and paces the net inhibition of the local cell assembly according to the next anticipated stimulus occurrences. Such a model predicts that input signals to a brain network would fall optimally at the phase of maximum net excitability of the input node. One consequence would be to maximize the perceptual processing of the stimulus by facilitating the relaying of its neural representation downstream 106 . © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

The purpose is essentially to propose a roadmap to guide future research, including the formation of test­ able hypotheses for scientists interested in MEG. At the mesoscopic regional scale, slower rhythms (delta through alpha) mark the phase of relative excitability of cell assemblies 10,103 . Gamma bursts tend to occur in volleys nested at certain phases of these slower rhythms, a well-studied phenomenon of coupling across frequencies captured by, for example, phase–amplitude coupling 104,105 measures ( Fig. 6a , b ). There is increasing evidence 106 that gamma cycles could represent timed opportunities for neural representations of, for example, incoming stimuli to be registered by cell assemblies and propagated further downstream in a bottom-up fashion. Beta oscillations so far have not been found to pace gamma bursts and do not seem to be driven directly by colocalized slower rhythms in the human resting state 101 . According to computational models and nascent experimental data 107 , they are rather thought to signal top-down modulations from higher order, executive regions in brain networks ( Fig. 6c , d ). A global roadmap for MEG to build on these recent and still rela­ tively sparse advances would ideally consist in (i) further clarifying the physiological principles structuring the local-to-global dynamics of neural oscillations, (ii) defining measures of regional activation and inter-areal communication in brain systems that are driven by these biological principles (iii) using these measures to survey the dynamical repertoire of the resting brain, which remains largely uncharted, and (iv) understanding how sensory inputs interact with this repertoire, enabling functional integration and eventually behav­ ior.

Our bibliographic survey (source: Web of Knowledge) indicates that, in volume, the yearly production of scientific publications concerning MEG has been increasing over the past 25 years. About 750 indexed journal articles and conference pro­ ceeding entries are published on an annual basis ( Fig. 7a ). However, although fMRI and PET were developed more recently, fMRI some 20 years after MEG, their respective volume of research production approaches three (for PET) to eight (for fMRI) times that of MEG’s. The historically oldest technique of all, EEG, remains the leading inte­ grative neuroscience tool, with fMRI as a close runner-up.

One par­ ticular distinction of MEG with respect to EEG’s considerable volume of research is source imaging and modeling as a particular topic of interest. This concerns only about 6% of all EEG research, compared to at least one-third in MEG. We also note that since the turn of the twenty-first century, the research output of all techniques has been slowly declining relatively to fMRI’s ( Fig. 7b ). MEG at present contributes 5% of the neuroscience research that uses the techniques surveyed, although with increasing impact ( Fig. 7c ).

We have already reviewed the unique contributions and potential of MEG for studying the large-scale dynamics of brain activ­ ity. This represents the strongest scientific asset of the technique. More thematically, MEG users have been investigating the principal topics of systems and behavioral neuroscience, with greater representation from systems, cognitive and clinical research studies, the strong pres­ ence of methodological developments, and emerging themes such as resting-state brain research ( Fig. 7e ). Excellent topical reviews are available to dive into each subfield in detail: methods 109 ; the inte­ grative neuroscience of language 110 ; consciousness 111,112 ; and trans­ lational aspects of clinical neuroscience, including epilepsy 113,114 , autism spectrum disorders 115 and movement disorders 116 . We wish to highlight an experimental approach that is not specific to the modality, but which has gained significant momentum in MEG. It consists in entraining neural systems with steady-state sensory stimulation or detecting brain activity that is temporally coherent with behavioral or peripheral measures, such as movement param­ eters. Such experimental models take great advantage of the tempo­ ral resolution of the technique and enhance SNR by ‘tagging’ neural responses with stimulus-imposed or stimulus-induced frequencies of interest. A body of compelling work has grown in audition 117 , includ­ ing prosodic features of natural speech 118,119 and music 120 perception; vision 121,122 ; attention 123,124 and motor system 125 research using such methodology",

Conclusions We have reviewed MEG as a neuroimaging modality in its own right, for the widest range of integrative neuroscience research topics. Although its scientific presence is strong, MEG could attract a larger and broader community of scientists. Advances in research methods and practical tools are now available to make MEG more accessible. Although the signals are complex, their extraction and interpre­ tation can be facilitated by the emergence of testable mechanistic frameworks of interdependent neural dynamics. Like those for MRI and PET, initiatives to share large MEG data openly in repositories are now well underway. This is bene­ ficial to establishing normative and disease-specific variants of electrophysiological activity and to the reproducibility and generaliza­ tion of research methods and results. Commercial entities could at present better manage the expecta­ tions of practitioners to avoid misconceptions about MEG as a routine clinical modality. Looking forward, they could make stronger efforts toward the integration of research tools into certified analytic pipelines. This would with no doubt increase the yield of MEG in the epilepsy clinic and see the modality penetrate more subspecialties of neurology and neuropsychiatry. We also emphasize that MEG is a technique that readily bridges with other measures and methods such as electrophysiology (intracranial local field potential recordings and scalp EEG), blood flow and oxygen metabolism (near infrared spectroscopy), brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial alternating current stimula­ tion), all of which can be performed concurrently with MEG. This offers researchers tremendous opportunities to cross-validate findings between techniques and between human and animal bodies of work, and to build on the superaddition of jointly processed multimodal data volumes",

Controversies in clinical neurophysiology. MEG is superior to EEG in the localization of interictal epileptiform activity: con. Clin. Neurophysiol. 115 , 1010–1020 (2004). An interesting read when paired with the ‘pro-MEG’ counterpoint piece represented by ref. 19. The author does not entirely conclude that MEG is useless and redundant with EEG. He advocates for joint data acquisitions of the two modalities, especially for the clinical evaluation of epilepsy, where EEG has set the standard in clinical electrophysiology . 21.

Logothetis 3.1 Introduction The ability to non-invasively study the architeture and function of the human brain constitutes one of the most exciting cornerstones for modern medicine, psychology and neuroscience. Current in vivo imaging techniques not only provide cliically essential information and allow new forms of treatment but also reveal insights into the mechanisms behind brain function and malfuntion. This supremacy of modern imaging rests on its ability to study the structural properties of the nervous system simultaneously with the funtional changes related to neuronal activity. As a result, imaging allows us to combine information about the spatial organization and connectivity of the nervous system with information about the underlying neuronal processes and provides the only means to link perception and cognition with the neural substrates in the human brain. Functional imaging techniques build on the inteconnections of cerebral blood flow (CBF), the brain’s energy demand and the neuronal activity (for reviews on this topic, see Heeger and Ress 2002 ; Logothetis 2002 ; Logothetis and Wandell 2004 ; Lauritzen 2005 ). Indeed, elaborate mechnisms exist to couple changes in CBF and blood oxygenation to the maintenance and restoration of ionic gradients and the synthesis, transport and reuptake of neurotransmitters. More than 125 years ago, Angelo Mosso had already reaized that there must be a relation between energy demand and CBF when he observed increasing brain pulsations in a patient with a permanent skull defect performing a mental task (Mosso 1881 )",

Similar observations on the coupling of blood flow to neuronal activity (from experments on animals) led Roy and Sherrington to make the insightful statement that “the chemcal products of cerebral metabolism contained in the lymph that bathes the walls of the arterioles of the brain can cause variations of the calibre of the cerebral vessels: that is, in this reaction, the brain possesses an intrinsic mechanism by which its vascular supply can be varied locally in corespondence with local variations of functional activity” (Roy and Sherrington 1890 ). Nowadays, there is little doubt about the usfulness of imaging to basic research and clinical diagnosis. In fact, with the wide availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional imaging has become a self-sustaining branch of neuroscience research. Yet, and despite all this progress, it is still not clear how faithfully funtional imaging replicates the patterns of neuronal activity underlying the changes in brain perfusion.

This holds especially true for the blood-oxygeation level-dependent signal (BOLD-fMRI), which is probably the most widely used functional imaging technique (Ogawa et al. 1998 ). As direct measurements of neuronal activity can be obtained from mesoscopic recordings of electrical potetials on the scalp (EEG) as well as from spatially localized recordings using fine microelectrodes, they offer a wide variety of signals that charaterize neuronal processes",

    "chunk_text": ". Hence, before revieing the neurophysiological basis of the functional imaging signal, it is worth considering the proerties of the signals recorded using electrophysological methods. 3.2 The Compound Neural Signal Electrophysiological studies at the system level typically record extracellular signals, defined by the superposition of local currents. In cotrast to the intracellular recordings that directly assess the membrane potential of individual neurons, extracellular signals can arise from a number of sources and are more difficult to intepret. Neurons are embedded in the extracelllar medium, which acts as a volume conductor, allowing the passive spread of electrical signals across considerable spatial distances. For an extracellular recording point, the inflow of postively charged ions into the active sites of a neron appears as a current sink (inward currents), while inactive membrane sites act as a source (outward currents) for the active regions. Given the resistive nature of the extracellular medium, these currents generate so-called extracellular field potentials (EFP) (Freeman 1975 ). The sinal measured by an electrode placed at a neural site represents the mean EFP from the spatially weighted sum of sinks and sources along mutiple cells at this particular site. In addition, by the superposition principle, the EFPs from mutiple cells add up linearly throughout the volume conductor. Thus, for cells or cell compartments, with diametrically opposite orientations, currents of equal magnitude but opposite polarity will generate potentials that tend to cancel each other, while for well-aligned and elongated processes of neural elements, the currents add, resulting in a strongly oriented electric field. Despite these difficulties in interpreting the measured signals, EFP remains the most important tool for the sytems neurophysiologist, as they convey a great deal of information about the underlying brain function",

    "chunk_text": ". If a small-tipped microelectrode is placed sufficiently close to the soma or axon of a neron, then the measured EFP directly reports the spike (action potentials) of that neuron and posibly also of its immediate neighbours. The fiing rates of such well-isolated neurons have been the critical measure for comparing neural actiity with sensory processing or behaviour ever since the early development of microelectrodes (Adrian and Zotterman 1929 ). Indeed, measuing firing rates has been the mainstay of systems neuroscience for decades. Although a great deal has been learned from this measure of neuronal activity, the single-unit technique has the draback of not providing information about suthreshold integrative processes or associational operations taking place at a given site. In addtion, this recording technique suffers from a bias toward certain cell types and sizes (Towe and Harding 1970 ; Stone 1973 ). For large neurons, the active and passive regions are further apart, resulting in a substantially greater flow of mebrane current and a larger extracellular spike than for a small cell. As a result, spikes generated by large neurons will remain above noise level over a greater distance from the cell than spikes from small neurons. It follows that typically measured spiking activity mostly represents the small poulation of large cells, which are the pyramidal cells in the neocortex. This bias is particularly pronounced in experiments with alert-behaving animals or humans, in which even slight movments of the subjects make it extremely difficult to record from smaller neurons for a sufficiently long time (Fried et al. 1997 ; Kreiman et al. 2000 ). As a result, most of the experiments using singlunit extracellular recordings report on the activity C. Kayser and N. K.

If the impedance of the microelectrode is sufficiently low or when no clear signal from individual neurons can be isolated, then the electrode can be used to monitor the totality of the action potentials in that region. Often, the multiunit activity (MUA) is characterized as compound electrical signal in a frequency range above 300–500 Hz. This signal has been shown to be site specific (Buchwald and Grover 1970 ) and to vary systematically with stimulus propeties in the same way as the activity of single nerons (e.g. Kayser et al. ( 2007a )). There is good evidence that MUA activity reflects variations in the magnitude of extracellular spike potentials, with large-amplitude signal variations in the MUA reflecting large-amplitude extracellular potentials. Overall, the MUA seems to incorprate signals from a sphere with a radius of 150– 300 mm, depending on the detailed electrode properties (Buchwald and Grover 1970 ; Legatt et al. 1980 ; Gray et al. 1989 ). Typically, such a region will contain thousands of neurons, sugesting that the MUA is especially sensitive to the synchronous firings of many cells, which is further enhanced by the principle of superpostion mentioned above. While the fast, high-frequency components of the aggregate field potentials mostly reflect the spiking activity of neighbouring neurons, the slower components of the EFP seem to reflect a different kind of activity. The so-called local field potential (LFP) is defined as the low-frequency component of the EFP and represents mostly slow events reflecting cooperative activity in neural populations. In contrast to the MUA, the magnitude of the LFP does not correlate with cell size but instead reflects the extent and geometry of local dendrites (Fromm and Bond 1964 , 1967 ; Buchwald et al. 1966 )",

They form a so-called open field arrangement, in which dendrites face in one direction and somata in another, producing strong dendrite-to-soma dipoles when they are activated by synchronous synaptic input. The spatial summation of the LFP has been suggested to reflect a weighted average of synchronized dendrosomatic components of the synaptic signals of a neural population within 0.5–3 mm of the electrode tip (Mitzdorf 1985 , 1987 ; Juergens et al. 1999 ). The upper limits of the spatial extent of LFP summation were indirectly calculated by computing the phase coherence as a function of interelectrode distance in experiments with simultaneous multiple-­electrode recordings (e.g. see Fig. 3.1 ). Combined intracellular and field potential recordings also suggest a synaptic/ dendritic origin of the LFPs, representing locally averaged excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, which are considerably slower than the spiking activity (Steriade and Amzica 1994 ; Steriade et al. 1998 ). In addition, the LFP can also include other types of slow activity unrelated to synaptic events, including voltage-dependent membrane oscillations (Juergens et al. 1999 ) and spike after potentials (Buzsaki et al. 1988 ). In summary, three different signals can comonly be extracted from extracellular micrelectrode recordings, each partially covering a different frequency regime of the acquired sinal.

Covering the same frequency range, the single-unit activity reports mainly on the activity of the principal neurons that form the major output of a cortical area. In contrast and representing slower events, the LFP reflects slow waveforms such as synaptic potentials, afterptentials and voltage-gated membrane oscillations that mostly reflect the input of a given cortical area as well as its local intracortical processing. 3.3 The Passive Electric Properties of the Brain To better understand how the signal picked up by a microelectrode emerges from the underling neuronal processes, especially with regard to the distinction of the different frequency regimes, it is important to know the basic electrical proerties of brain tissue. The extracellular micrenvironment consists of narrow gaps between cellular processes, probably not more than 200 Å wide on average. These spaces form a complex three-­dimensional mosaic filled with extracelllar fluid. Theoretical considerations suggest that currents and ions spread within this fluid but not through the cells (Robinson 1968 ). As a result, the resistance to electrical currents of this space depends on the detailed spatial layout of neurnal tissue, possibly resulting in an un-isotropic current flow that does not necessarily behave like that in a simple saline bath (Ranck 1963a , b ; Mitzdorf 1985 ). Especially, from these cosiderations, it is unclear whether cortical tissue behaves like an ohmic resistor or whether signals of different frequencies experience frequency-­ dependent attenuation, that is, whether the tissue behaves like a capacitive filter",

A frequency-dependent behaviour was sugested by the fact that the activity of the slow wave measured by the EEG is largely independent of spiking responses, suggesting strong frequency-­ filtering properties of the tissue overlying the sources of the activity (Ajmone-Marsan 1965 ; Bedard et al. 2004 , 2006 ). In addition, in extrcellular unit recordings, the shape and amplitude of recorded spikes depend on the spatial position of the electrode relative to the neuron (Gold et al. 2006 ), while slow potentials show much less sesitivity to position and correlate over large spatial distances. Since the lower frequencies of the field potentials typically correlate over larger spatial distances than the higher frequencies of the same signal (Fig. 3.1 ), this can be interpreted as strong evidence for the cortical tissue to behave as a capacitive filter (Destexhe et al. 1999 ). Such a frequency-dependent impedance spectrum could selectively attenuate electric signals of some frquencies more than those of others, for example, high-frequency spiking events more than lofrequency potentials. To clarify whether the brain’s tissue behaves like an ohmic or a capacitive medium, we recently quantified the passive electrical spread of different signals in the brain in vivo. These measurements were conducted in the primary visual cortex, a typical model system for sensory processing, and on the scale of hundreds of micrometres to several millimetres, that is, the scale relevant to the typical functional imaging techniques such as fMRI-BOLD (Logothetis et al. 2007 ). At this scale, theoretical considerations suggest that the extracellular medium can be considered as largely homogenous and mostly isotropic (within the grey matter). Our results confirmed this and, more importantly, demonstrated that the cortical tissue does not behave like a capacitive filter but acts like an ohmic resistor, attenuating signals of different frequencies in the same manner",

Our measurements employed a four-­ point electrode system, allowing highly accurate and unperturbed measurements of resistance of cortical tissue in vivo. Over a wide range of curent frequencies and for all tested spatial arrangments of the electrodes, the brain’s grey matter tissue behaved like an isotropic and ohmic resitor. The white matter, in contrast, showed diretional anisotropies, with lower resistance in one and higher resistance in the orthogonal direction. Yet, as for the grey matter, the white matter also behaved like an ohmic resistor. Altogether, our measurements clearly rejected the notion that the cortical tissue behaves like a frequency-­dependent C. Kayser and N. K. Logothetis 19 filter, at least on the spatial scale relevant to the typical functional imaging applications. As a consequence of this finding, one has to conclude that some of the properties of the field potentials noted above, such as the diffeent degree of spatial correlations in different frequency bands, are not the result of passive electrical spread in the tissue. In contrast, our findings suggest that the long-range correlations of the low-frequency signals, such as the theta or beta rhythms, result from properties of the geerators of these signals, that is, from the spatial patterning of the connections mediating these oscillations, and hence might be a property that is also reflected in the functional imaging signal. 3.4 The Neural Correlate of the BOLD Signal Given the distinction of the different signals that can be obtained from extracellular recordings, one can ask which signal best explains the activity patterns seen in functional imaging experiments.

An indirect approach asks whether both methodologies yield similar answers to a typical neuroscientific quetion, such as whether a certain region in the brain responds to a given stimulus. A direct approach, on the other hand, measures both signals at the same time to directly correlate the functional imaging activation with the different signals of neuronal activity. A typical example for an indirect comparison was provided by Rees et al. who compared human fMRI measurements with electrophysiologcal data from single-unit recordings in monkeys (Rees et al. 2000 ). Both data sets were obtained from the motion-specific areas of the respective species and reflected how much the respective signal changed as a function of the stimulus’ motion coherence. Comparing the slope of both signals, the authors concluded that the BOLD signal was directly proportional to the average firing rate, with a constant of proportionality of approximately nine spikes per second per pecentage BOLD increase.

The right panel displays the measured impedance values for different current strengths in cortex ( solid lines ) and for electronic capacitances. Clearly, the impedance spetrum of the cortex is nearly flat compared to that of the capacitance, suggesting that the cortex does not behave like a frequency-dependent filter but rather like an ohmic resistor. For details, see Logothetis et al. ( 2007 ) 3 The Electrophysiological Background of the fMRI Signal 20 but focusing on the signal increase in primary visual cortex as a function of stimulus contrast, Heeger et al. confirmed such a linear relation of spiking activity and the BOLD signal, albeit with a smaller proportionality constant of 0.4 spikes per percentage BOLD increase (Heeger et al. 2000 ). While these results suggest a good corrlation of the BOLD signal and firing rates in the same cortical region, they already indicate that the details of this relation, here the constant or proportionality, depend on detailed characteritics of each area. While the above studies focused only on fiing rates, another study on primary visual cortex extended this approach to a wider range of stiuli and physiological signals (Kayser et al. 2004 ). Studying the cat visual system, the BOLD signal was obtained from one group of animals, while MUA and field potential responses were recorded in a second group of animals. As a metric of comparison, the authors asked which of the diferent electrophysiological signals would yield similar relative responses to different stimuli as found in the BOLD signal. Stated otherwise, if stimulus A elicits a stronger BOLD response than stimulus B, which of the electrophysiologcal signal obeys the same relation across a large fraction of recording sites sampled in the same region of interest from which the BOLD signal is sampled (Fig. 3.3 )?

The best match between LFP and BOLD was obtained in the frequency range of 20–50 Hz, while slower oscillations generally showed a poor concordance with the imaging data. Noteworthy, this study also showed that the precise results of an indirect comparison can depend strongly on the specific stimuli employed: when the contrast involved grating stimuli, which elicit strong gamma band responses, a good match between the gamma band of the LFP and the BOLD was obtained. However, when the contrast involved only stimuli with less distinct activation patterns in the LFP, the correlation of LFP and BOLD also showed less frequency dependence. While these studies only compared the aveage response strength of each signal, another extended the comparison to the temporal dimesion and correlated the average time course obtained from fMRI with that obtained from neronal responses (Mukamel et al. 2005 ). Using the human auditory cortex as a model system, these authors correlated the average fMRI responses obtained in a group of healthy subjects with intrcortical recordings obtained from a group of eplepsy patients monitored for surgical treatment. While the BOLD signal again correlated well with the LFP, it showed an even stronger corrlation with neuronal firing rates, contrasting the above result from visual cortex. As these examples demonstrate, the results of an indirect comparison between the BOLD signal and neuronal responses may vary depending on the particular experimental paradigm and stimuli involved.

While such averaging will result in a robust estimate of the stimulus-related response, it will also remove the trial to trial variability of neuronal responses, the influence of the mental state and other brain state fluctuations that are not locked to the stimulus used to align the responses. As a result, one compares two “artificial” signals that do not necessarily resemble the pattern of neuronal activity seen during normal brain funtion. In addition, the temporal resolution of the imaging signal is often quite low, especially in human studies, resulting in a blurred signal which cannot be adequately compared to the fast changes of neuronal activity (see also below). An indirect comparison of functional imaging and neuronal activity can hence only speak about a certain, stimulus-driven aspect of the signals but does not generalize the complex interactions of feedforward and feedback processing that occur during normal conditions, where each activity pattern might be unique and non-repeatable.

( 2004 ) 3 The Electrophysiological Background of the fMRI Signal 22 To overcome the limitations of these indirect comparisons, our lab examined the relationship of the BOLD signal to neural activity directly by simultaneously acquiring electrophysiologcal and fMRI data from the same animals. To this end, we developed a 4.7 T vertical scanner environment specifically for combined neurphysiology and imaging experiments, including novel methods for interference compensation, microelectrodes and data denoising (Logothetis et al. 2001 ). Our measurements showed that the fMRI-­BOLD response directly reflects a local increase in neural activity as assessed by the EFP signal. For the majority of recoring sites, the BOLD signal was found to be a linear but not time-­invariant function of LFPs, MUA and the firing rate of individual neurons (Fig. 3.4 , upper panel). After stimulus presenttion, a transient increase in power was typically observed across all LFP frequencies, followed by a lower level of activation that was maitained for the entire duration of stimulus prsentation. The MUA, in contrast, often showed a more transient response, suggesting a lower corelation to the BOLD response. This hypothesis was confirmed using system identification tecniques: while in general both LFPs and MUA served as good predictors for the BOLD, LFPs on average accounted for 7.6% more of the varance in the fMRI response than the MUA.

Rather, we suggested on the basis of these observations that the BOLD signal reflects the input to a local region and its local processing, as reflected by the aggregate synaptic activity, more than its output, as reflected in the spiking activity of the principal cells. A recent study in the cat visual cortex cofirmed these findings by combining optical imaging to measure haemodynamic responses with simultaneous microelectrode recordings (Niessing et al. 2005 ). Along the lines of prevous results, they found a frequency-dependent match between the imaging signal and LFPs. Especially, frequency bands below 10 Hz showed negative correlations with the imaging signal, that is, reduced field potential during increased blood flow response. Higher frequencies, espcially between 50 and 90 Hz, showed good corelation with the imaging signal and, importantly, stronger correlations than observed for the MUA. It is worth noting that the exact strength of the correlation between LFP, MUA and BOLD depends on the detailed properties of the pardigm and data acquisition. Especially, the diferent acquisition rates for functional imaging signals and neuronal responses can have prfound influences, as can easily be demonstrated (Fig. 3.4 , middle panel). Starting from a BOLD signal which was acquired using a temporal reslution of 250 ms, we subsequently decimated all signals to an effective temporal resolution of 3 s, the typical temporal resolution of human imaging studies. While the “fast” BOLD signal exhibits the well-established differential correlation of LFP and MUA with the BOLD, the “slow” signal shows an overall stronger correlation and less of a difference between LFP and MUA. Decreasing the temporal resolution effectively smoothens a signal and increases the coherence between LFP frequency bands hence the increased correltion",

Not surprisingly, the correlation coefficients did not increase uniformly across frequency bands; the filtering particularly affected the high-­ frequency bands (>60 Hz), which are typically modulated on faster timescales. As a result, the smoothing unavoidably increases the correltion of MUA to the BOLD response as well. Such simple differences of the temporal resoltion of the acquired signals can explain the diferent degree of correlations found in ours and in indirect human studies, since the latter heaily relied on temporally smoothed signals and ­subject-­averaged signals (Mukamel et al. 2005 ). To conclude, care must be taken when interpreing correlations of haemodynamic and neuronal signals, as apparent conflicts can simply arise from methodological artefacts rather than true differences. 3.5 The Coupling of Synaptic Activity and CBF A reason for the more gradual differences between LFP and MUA in their relation to the BOLD sinal is that under many conditions, MUA and LFPs will vary together. In other words, in many stiulation conditions, the output of any processing station in subcortical and early cortical structures is likely to reflect the changes of the input, and the LFP-MUA relationship will be “tight,” and both will be well correlated with BOLD. Yet, this scenario might be an “exception” when generaing cognitive maps during complex tasks; as in such cases, the subject’s “mental” state might be instantiated in diverse feedforward and feedback processes that do not necessarily increase the net output of cortical microcircuits. Hence, condtions might exist during which there is a dissciation of these signals, for example, a condition in which an increase in local input (LFP) results in a reduction in local output activity (MUA)",

A powerful example of such a dissociation was prvided by Mathiesen et al. ( 1998 , 2000 ), Thomsen et al. ( 2004 ). These authors nicely exploited the synaptic organization of the cerebellar cortex, where electrical stimulation of the parallel fibres 3 The Electrophysiological Background of the fMRI Signal 24 causes monosynaptic excitation of the Purkinje cells and disynaptic inhibition of the same nerons through the basket cells. This results in inhbition of the spiking activity in the Purkinje cells while at the same time increasing the synaptic input to these cells. Combining electrophysological recordings with laser Doppler flowmtry to measure changes in CBF, Mathiesen et al. demonstrated a powerful dissociation of the spiing activity and the CBF. Both LFPs and CBF increased while spiking activity ceased, clearly demonstrating that increases in CBF or BOLD do not allow to make inferences about potential increases or decreases in the spiking activity of the stimulated region (Lauritzen and Gold 2003 ). A similar dissociation of the imaging signal and neuronal firing rates could be seen in our studies (Logothetis et al. 2001 ). Often, the siglor multiunit activity showed strong response adaptation during the first few seconds, with a subsequent decay of the firing rates to baseline. In contrast to this, the BOLD signal and the LFP did persist above baseline throughout the stimulation period. As a result, during the sustained period of the stimulus, only the field potential can be assciated with the imaging signal, but not the spiking activity. Importantly, there was no condition or observation period during which the opposite was observed.

For example, the application of a serotonin receptor agonist, which causes pesistent hyperpolarization of pyramidal neurons, leads to a ceasing of the MUA responses (Fig. 3.4 , lower panel). However, at the very same time, both the LFP and the BOLD signal still respond to visual stimulation, again demonstrating that the BOLD signal is not necessarily coupled to neurnal spiking responses (see Rauch et al. ( 2008 ) for further results along this line). Is the CBF signal then linearly coupled to synaptic activity? While this indeed seems to hold good under some conditions, other coditions produce a nonlinear relation between afferent input and the haemodynamic response (Mathiesen et al. 1998 ; Norup Nielsen and Lauritzen 2001 ). Especially for very low or high levels of synaptic input, the CBF response can be decoupled from the input. For example, inducing deactivation of neuronal responses by either functional deactivation or application of TTX resulted in only a small reduction in basline CBF (Gold and Lauritzen 2002 ). During such instances of neurovascular decoupling, the imaging data does not reflect all the changes in synaptic afferents, clearly highlighting the liited dynamic range of functional imaging. Such nonlinear relation between synaptic activity and CBF might, for example, arise from the unequal contribution of different receptors and channels to synaptic potentials and blood flow. For exaple, glutamatergic NMDA channels contribute to CBF but only little to the LFP (Hoffmeyer et al. 2007 ). As a result, blood flow responses might also exist in the absence of large changes in the LFP, providing strong evidence that it is not the extracellular current that causes increase in CBF but the intracellular signalling cascades related to neurotransmitter release, uptake and recycling",

Indeed, while the haemodynamic response prvides supplies of glucose and oxygen, it is not the processes that require the energy that call for an increase in CBF but rather the processes triggered in a feedforward manner by neurotransmitter-­ related signalling (Lauritzen 2005 ). The notion that functional imaging measures the aggregate synaptic input to a local area also resolves a number of apparently conflicting results from imaging and electrophysiologcal experiments. Being sensitive to the synaptic input, functional imaging “sees” modulatory laeral and feedback projections, which might not be strong enough to induce significant changes in neuronal firing rates but nevertheless provides a larger proportion of the total synaptic input. For example, human imaging revealed influences of spatial attention in many visual areas, including primary visual cortex. At the same time, such attentional influences have been persistently difficult to demonstrate using single-neuron recordings or turned out to be much weaker than expected from human imaging (Luck et al. 1997 ; Kastner and Ungerleider 2000 ; Heeger and Ress 2002 ). Given that attentional influences are suposedly mediated by feedback projections from higher visual and frontoparietal regions, they C. Kayser and N. K. Logothetis 25 might provide exactly this kind of input that is visible only using functional imaging. Along the same lines, it has been much easier to see cross-­ modal interactions, that is, influences of one sensory modality on another, using functional imaging than using electrophysiology (Calvert 2001 ; Kayser and Logothetis 2007 ). For exaple, functional imaging demonstrated that audtory cortex can be modulated and even activated by visual or somatosensory stimuli (Kayser et al. 2007b ), while the same effects are only weakly present at the level of single-neuron firing rates",

However, in full agreement with the above, visual modulation was well evident at the level of field potentials recorded in auditory cortex, again demonstrating a closer correspondence of the BOLD signal with field potentials than with fiing rates (Kayser et al. 2008 ). 3.6 Conclusions The haemodynamic responses characterized by functional imaging better reflect the aggregate synaptic activity and local processing that is characterized by the LFPs rather than providing information about the typical firing rates in the same region. This partly results from the mechnisms that drive increases in blood flow, which reside upstream from the axosomatic level and near the synaptic-dendritic level. The collective findings of many studies prvide good evidence for the notion that functional imaging reflects the input into a local region but not necessarily the output of the same. Under many normal conditions, the input and output of a local region will be related, and hence funtional imaging will provide information about the typical neuronal firing rates in the same region. As a result of this sensitivity to synaptic input, functional imaging signals are more susceptible to modulatory feedback input, which often might provide only a minor contribution to the response strength of large principal neurons. However, for a priori and most experimental conditions, it is unclear what relationship to expect between iand output, and hence feedforwarand feedback-­related activations cannot be distiguished. As a result, it can sometimes be misleaing, if not dangerous, to make direct inferences from imaging results about the underlying neronal processes",

This article surveys recent findings regarding brain mechanisms of hedonic ‘liking’, such as the existence of cubic-millimeter hedonic hotspots in nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum for opioid amplification of sensory pleasure. It also considers brain ‘wanting’ or incentive salience systems important to appetite, such as mesolimbic dopamine systems and opioid motivation circuits that extend beyond the hedonic hotspots.

Can improved knowledge about brain reward systems help guide thinking about eating disorders and devising better treatments? Basic brain systems for food reward carry potential implications for understanding normal eating and eating disorders. It is important to note first that brain reward systems are active participants, not just passive conduits, in the act of eating.

We may be used to thinking of sweet tastes as innately pleasant, but their pleasure is not contained in the intrinsic detail of their sensation but rather in their evolved ability to act as keys that unlock activation of brain ‘liking’ systems [1–3]. This is evident by considering that if the ability to unlock hedonic brain systems is lost, a sweet taste loses its pleasure while remaining sweet as ever. For example, a particular sweet taste can become perceived as disgusting rather than nice when an individual learns a taste aversion for it after pairing with visceral illness [3–6]. Conversely, bitterness activates brain systems of aversion and disgust to be innately aversive, but tastes of cranberries, coffee, beer, gin, or opiates can become pleasant for many individuals when experience makes them into keys for hedonic brain systems. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Understanding brain reward systems for food ‘wanting’ versus ‘liking’ To find brain mechanisms for ‘wanting’ and ‘liking’ first requires that those psychological components of reward be recognizable in measurable ways. This section turns to some issues regarding the brain systems that help generate ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ for food rewards. ‘Liking’ is essentially a hedonic reaction to the pleasure of a reward. It is nearly what most people mean when they say reward. ‘Wanting’ on the other hand is not pleasure, even though also a component of reward, and may be less intuitive. 2.1. What is ‘wanting’ if it's not ‘liking’ ‘ Wanting’ is a shorthand term my colleagues and I use for the psychological process of incentive salience [7–10]. Incentive salience is attributed to rewards and their predictive cues, which helps determine their motivational value. Those cues then become potent triggers of ‘wanting’. In this way, cravings can be triggered by simply imagining the sight, smell and taste of palatable foods [11]. ‘ Wanting’ is psychologically and neurally distinguishable from ‘liking’, even if they often happen together. According to the incentive salience concept, ‘wanting’ is a mesolimbigenerated process that can tag certain stimulus representations in the brain that have Pavlovian associations with reward. When incentive salience is attributed to a reward stimulus representation, it makes that stimulus attractive, attention grabbing, and that stimulus and its associated reward suddenly become enhanced motivational targets. Because incentive salience is often triggered by Pavlovian conditioned stimuli or reward cues, it often manifests as cutriggered ‘wanting’ for reward. When attributed to a specific stimulus, incentive salience may make an autoshaped cue light appear food-like to the autoshaped pigeon or rat that perceives it, causing the animal to try to eat the cue",

    "chunk_text": ". In autoshaping, animals sometimes direct behavioral pursuit and consummatory responses towards the Pavlovian cue, literally trying to eat the conditioned stimulus if it is a cue for food reward [12–15].When attributed to the smell emanating from cooking, incentive salience can rivet a person's attention and trigger sudden thoughts of eating—and perhaps it can do so under some circumstances even if the person merely vividly imagines the delicious food. But ‘wanting’ is not ‘liking’, and both together are necessary for normal reward. ‘Wanting’ without ‘liking’ is merely a sham or partial reward, without sensory pleasure in any sense. However, ‘wanting’ is still an important component of normal reward, especially when combined with ‘liking’. Reward in the full sense cannot happen without incentive salience, even if hedonic ‘liking’ is present. Hedonic ‘liking’ by itself is simply a triggered affective state—there need be no object of desire or incentive target, and no motivation for further reward. It is the process of incentive salience attribution that makes a specific associated stimulus or action the object of desire, that tags a specific behavior as the rewarded response, and that allows normal pleasure to spur desire for more. ‘Liking’ and ‘wanting’ are needed together for full reward. Fortunately, both usually happen together in human life. Berridge Page 2 Physiol Behav . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 July 14.

Cognitive goals and ordinary wanting Before leaving ‘wanting’ it is useful to note how the incentive salience meaning of the word ‘wanting’ (with quotation marks) as used above differs from what most people mean by the ordinary sense of the word wanting (without quotation marks). A subjective feeling of desire meant by the ordinary word wanting implies something both cognitive (involving an explicit goal) and conscious (involving a subjective feeling)",

    "chunk_text": ". A subjective feeling of desire meant by the ordinary word wanting implies something both cognitive (involving an explicit goal) and conscious (involving a subjective feeling). When you say you want something, you usually have in mind a cognitive expectation or idea of the something-you-want: a declarative representation of your goal. Your representation is based usually on your experience with that thing in the past. Or, if you have never before experienced that thing, then, the representation is based on your imagination of what it would be like to experience. In other words, in these cases, you know or imagine cognitively what it is you want, you expect to like it, and you may even have some idea of how to get it. These are all very cognitive form of wanting, involving declarative memories of the valued goal, explicit predictions for the potential future based on those memories, and cognitive understanding of causal relationships that exist between your potential actions and future attainment of your goal. By contrast, none of this cognition need be part of incentive salience ‘wants’ discussed above. Evidence indicates that incentive salience attributions do not need to be conscious and are mediated by relatively simple brain mechanisms [16,17]. Indeed under special circumstances like subliminal induction procedures, normal people can be made to ‘want’ to drink more of a sweet beverage than they otherwise would without becoming aware of any change in feeling or that anything has happened at all [18] (Fig. 1). Incentive salience ‘wants’ are triggered by foods and their cues [11,19,20]. Cue-triggered ‘wanting’ does not require understanding of causal relations about hedonic outcome",

Cue-triggered ‘wanting’ does not require understanding of causal relations about hedonic outcome. ‘Wanting’ processes can be triggered even without a person's conscious awareness that anything has happened [17].An important consequence of the difference between ‘wanting’ and more cognitive desires is that excessive incentive salience may in some cases lead to irrational ‘wants’ for outcomes that are not cognitively wanted, and that are neither liked nor even expected to be liked [21,22]. Behavioral neuroscience experiments have indicated that these forms of wanting may depend on different brain structures. For example, incentive salience ‘wanting’ depends highly on subcortical mesolimbic dopamine neurotransmission, whereas cognitive forms of wanting depend instead on cortical brain regions such as orbitofrontal cortex, prelimbic cortex and insular cortex [16,23]. The conclusion that there may be multiple kinds of psychological desire with different neural substrates has fascinating implications for disorders of desire, including the possibility of irrational desires in which individuals powerfully ‘want’ a reward that they cognitively do not want at all. 2.3. Measuring pleasure ‘liking’ Returning to the heart of reward: hedonic impact or pleasure. The practical problem in finding neural substrates for pleasure ‘liking’ is to first find a way to measure pleasure. Fortunately, pleasure ‘liking’ is a real psychological process with distinct neural mechanisms, and has objective markers in brain and behavior as well as subjective feelings [1]. The objective markers can be especially useful to give a handle on pleasure for neuroscientists, as I will describe below. Many brain sites are activated by food pleasures in neuroimaging studies of humans",

Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 July 14. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript pallidum; mesolimbic dopamine projections and even deep brainstem sites [8,11,24–37]. All of these brain structures may code pleasurable foods, in the sense of activating during the experience of seeing, smelling, tasting, or eating those rewards. The orbitofrontal cortex in particular has been suggested to code the pleasure of food stimuli in humans, especially along its medial edge and in a mid-anterior site that tracks changes in food pleasure during alliesthesia of hunger or satiety [28,34,35,38]. But let's also ask: which of these many brain structures actually cause or generate the pleasure of foods? Do all the neural activations generate pleasure ‘liking’ or only some? Other brain activations might reflect consequences of pleasure that were caused elsewhere. Those activations in turn might cause motivation, learning, cognition or some other function consequent to the reward, but they would not cause pleasure per se . How can the causal brain systems for pleasure be identified? Typically only by results of brain manipulation studies: a manipulation of a particular brain system will reveal pleasure causation if it produces an increase or decrease in ‘liking’ reactions to food pleasure (Fig. 2). Most brain manipulations cannot be performed ethically except in animals, yet one must also be able to identify pleasure ‘liking’ when it occurs, and that requires reliable indices of ‘liking’ reaction even in animals",

These were described originally in human infants by Jacob Steiner and in rats by Harvey Grill and Ralph Norgren, allied with Carl Pfaffmann [39–42]. Sweet tastes elicit positive facial ‘liking’ expressions (tongue protrusions, etc.), whereas bitter tastes instead elicit facial ‘disliking’ expressions (gapes, etc.) (Fig. 3 and Fig.4). Fortunately for studies of pleasure causation, these ‘liking–disliking’ facial reactions are homologous in humans and animals, in that they have developed from the same evolutionary source in humans, orangutans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and even rats and mice, and therefore share underlying brain circuits [42,43] (Fig. 3). The most similar ‘liking’ reactions are shown by species that are closest in phylogenetic relationship, and a number of the reactions share the same underlying deep structural features across humans, other primates and rodents. The deep features include conformity to identical allometric timing laws scaled to the particular size of the species (Fig. 4). For example, human or gorilla tongue protrusions to sweetness or gapes to bitterness may appear relaxed and slow, whereas the same reactions by rats or mice seem startlingly fast, yet, they are actually the ‘same’ durations in what is called an allometric sense; that is, each species is timed proportionally to their evolved sizes. That timing is programmed deep in their brains, which is evident in that even young infants obey the timing rule of their species. Such universal rules applying to different species further underlines the common brain origins of these ‘liking’ and ‘disliking’ reactions in rats and humans, and indicates that what is learned about brain mechanisms in animals is likely to apply to humans too. 2.4",

Brain systems for food pleasure This sets the stage for animal affective neuroscience studies to use these affective expressions to identify brain mechanisms that generate hedonic impact. Recent years have seen progress in identifying brain systems responsible for generating the pleasure gloss that makes palatable foods ‘liked’ [1,2,27,28,32,44–50]. What has emerged most recently is a connected network of hotspots in the limbic forebrain that use opioid neurotransmission to causally increase taste ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ together to enhance food reward. The hotspots form a distributed network of brain islands like an archipelago that connects the limbic forebrain and brainstem [48,51–54]. There are hedonic hotspots identified so far in the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum, and indicated to exist in deep brainstem regions such as the parabrachial nucleus in the pons; possibly others yet unconfirmed could exist in amygdala or in cortical regions such as orbitofrontal cortex [1,55]. These distributed ‘liking’ sites are all connected together so that Berridge Page 4 Physiol Behav . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 July 14. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript they interact as a single integrated ‘liking’ system, which operates by largely hierarchical control rules across the major levels of the brain (Fig. 2). 2.5. Building affect from the brainstem up Affect, in a sense, begins in the brainstem. Basic brainstem circuits participate in ‘liking’ reactions as well as in pain, and are partially autonomous, able to function as reflexes in an isolated brainstem. For example, basic positive or negative facial expressions are still found in human anencephalic infants born with a midbrain and hindbrain, but no cortex, amygdala, or classic limbic system, due to a congenital defect that prevents prenatal development of their forebrain",

Similarly, a decerebrate rat has an isolated brainstem, because of a surgical transaction at the top of its midbrain that separates the brainstem from the forebrain, but that decerebrate brainstem remains able to generate normal positive expressions to sweet tastes and negative expressions to bitter tastes when those are placed in the rat's mouth [56,57]. Some people find it disconcerting that decerebrates have the capacity to generate core affective reactions, or even grounds for rejecting facial expressions as a measure of affect. The rejection is rooted in traditional notions that a brainstem has only reflexes. It may seem hard to accept that facial hedonic expressions to sweetness can be any measure of ‘liking’ when decerebrate rats or infants display similar expressions. It is difficult for this view to accept that a decerebrate ‘likes’ the stimulus in any sense. There are really two points here: 1) whether the brainstem participates in mediating affect, and 2) whether in a normal individual with a whole brain, the same behavioral reaction expresses affect processes that are generated in the forebrain (rather than being just a brainstem reflex). First, is the brainstem at all affective? It is important to recognize that affect generation is not localized to just one place in the brain. We live in localizationist age, powered in part by the accomplishments of neuroimaging (and consistent with discoveries of forebrain hedonic hotspots). But the idea that pleasure and motivation arises in the forebrain can be carried too far: identifying a function in one brain site does not rule out that the same function is also mediated by another site elsewhere. Affect circuits are distributed across the brain, even down into the brainstem. Certainly a decerebrate rat or infant cannot like a sweet taste in the same sense that a normal individual does",

Certainly a decerebrate rat or infant cannot like a sweet taste in the same sense that a normal individual does. But I think it we should consider the possibility that it still has a residual core component of ‘liking’. Not necessarily a conscious pleasure, of course, but an affective subcomponent of the subcomponent of the ‘liking’ process nevertheless. After all, almost every feeling of physical pleasure or pain felt by your forebrain has climbed its way there through the brain stem. Ascending signals don't just pass through the brainstem; much processing happens to them on the way up. There is compelling reason to believe that affect begins in the brainstem for both pleasure and pain. In a normal brain, brainstem sites make important contributions to affective experiences that mostly are generated by forebrain circuits above them. For example, ‘liking’ and food ‘wanting’ are amplified by benzodiazepines microinjections in the parabrachial nucleus of the pons [58–60], where neurons code the palatability shift by changes in firing rate [61], and even decerebrates show enhanced ‘liking’ reactions to sucrose taste after benzodiazepine administration [62]. Even a decerebrate brain may contain the kernel of a ‘liking’ reaction that the word reflex does not adequately capture, just as the brainstem also contains substantial circuitry for pain and analgesia. This may reflect the adaptive functions of affective reactions throughout brain evolution [63], and may also be relevant to how unconscious ‘liking’ reactions occur in people even today [18]. Berridge Page 5 Physiol Behav . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 July 14.

As the pioneering neurologist John Hughlings Jackson described the brain's hierarchical organization a century ago, “They (forebrain structures) represent over again in more complex, etc., combinations, the parts which all middle centres have re-represented, and thus they represent the whole organism; they are re-re-representative” [64], (p. 42). This reiterative structure implies that the forebrain re-re-represents pleasures that the brainstem has already represented in simpler fashion. In turn, forebrain systems normally control the brainstem circuits, so that normal ‘liking’ reactions are not merely brainstem reflexes in a whole-brained individual. A good parallel to facial expression is vocalization: anencephalic infants also cry and vocalize and even a decerebrate rat squeaks and emits distress-type cries if its tail is pinched. But vocalizations such as the cries of normal babies or of normal rats are certainly not brainstem reflexes. Rather in a normal brain the brainstem systems are always under hierarchical control by forebrain systems: the brainstem systems are often activated at forebrain command. Likewise, as described below, forebrain hedonic hotspots control the ‘liking’ activation of brainstem-generated facial expressions. Obviously neither vocalizations or affective expressions are merely brainstem reflexes when generated by an entire brain that connects all levels via hierarchical control. Hierarchical control can be empirically demonstrated by the ability of a forebrain manipulation to activate affective reaction, such as when a drug microinjection in a limbic hedonic hotspot selectively doubles the number of ‘liking’ facial reactions elicited by a sweet taste. When brainstem is connected to the forebrain, the entire affective system operates in a hierarchical, flexible and complex fashion, and the final behavioral of affective expression redlects forebrain ‘liking’ processes. 2.6",

    "chunk_text": ". 2.6. Forebrain ‘liking’ generation: hedonic hotspot in nucleus accumbens Affect generated by forebrain circuits does indeed control ‘liking’ expressions to sweetness. As an illustration, we have recently endeavored to pinpoint affect-generating circuits in the forebrain, and have identified a hedonic hotspot in the nucleus accumbens that uses opioid and endocannabinoid signals to amplify ‘liking’ for sweetness. The nucleus accumbens is recognized to contain major subdivisions called core and shell, and the hotspot lies in the shell subdivision: specifically, a cubic-millimeter volume of tissue in the rostrodorsal quadrant of the medial shell. The medial shell is a brick-shaped entity that lies on its long edge and runs lengthwise front to back. The hedonic hotspot in the medial shell amplifies ‘liking’ by using opioid and endocannabinoid neurochemical signals released within it. Opioid neurotransmitters, such as enkephalin and endorphin are mimicked by opiate drugs made from the opium poppy (e.g., heroin). Endocannabinoid neurotransmitters such as anandamide are mimicked by drugs such as marijuana. A number of investigators have suggested over the years that endogenous opioid or cannabinoid receptor activation stimulates appetite in part by enhancing ‘liking’ for the perceived palatability of food [46,48,65–74]. Our results have confirmed the hypothesis that these agents amplify food ‘liking’. In the hedonic hotspot of the nucleus accumbens, activating the mu subtype of opioid receptor in particular causes increase in food reward ‘liking’ (and ‘wanting’ too). Studies led by Susana Peciña in our laboratory found that within the cubic-millimeter hotspot site in the medial shell, microinjections of a drug (DAMGO) which activate the mu type of opioid receptor appear sufficient to enhance the pleasure gloss painted by the brain on sweetness sensation [53,55,75,76]. More than double the usual number of positive ‘liking’ reactions were emitted to sucrose taste by rats with DAMGO microinjections in their hotspots",

More than double the usual number of positive ‘liking’ reactions were emitted to sucrose taste by rats with DAMGO microinjections in their hotspots. ‘Disliking’ reactions to quinine were never enhanced, but rather were suppressed by DAMGO in and around the hotspot (Fig. 2). Berridge Page 6 Physiol Behav . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 July 14. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript Similarly for endocannabinoids, a study by Stephen Mahler and Kyle Smith found that an anatomically-overlapping hotspot appears to exist in medial shell for anandamide, which likely acts by stimulating the CB1 type of cannabinoid receptor [55,77]. Inside the accumbens hotspot, anandamide microinjection potently doubled the number of positive ‘liking’ facial reactions that sucrose taste elicits from rats, just as opioid stimulation had, whereas again aversive reactions to bitter were not similarly enhanced. It is possible that opioid and endocannabinoid signals in the overlapping hotspots interact or cooperate together to amplify sensory pleasures. Anandamide has been suggested to be a reverse neurotransmitter, which would be released by a target neuron in the shell to float back to nearby presynaptic axon terminals and stimulate CB1 receptors especially. Future studies may be able to explore if endocannabinoid signals enhance ‘liking’ by recruiting presynaptic opioid release, perhaps in a cooperative positive feedback mechanism. To aid in pinpointing the ‘liking’ mechanisms we developed a ‘Fos plume’ tool that maps the boundaries of hedonic hotspots. A Fos plume contains neurons clustered around a microinjection site which are stimulated by the drug to begin transcription and translation of the fos gene into Fos protein inside their nuclei, as a step to activating other genes and changing the molecular biology of the neurons that in turn changes the neurons' functions",

When a drug microinjection causes an increase in ‘liking’, neurons directly stimulated by the drug and most likely responsible for starting the psychological enhancement can be visualized as a plume-shaped fluorescent green group surrounding the microinjection site (when the brain tissue is processed soon after). This plume allows assignment of causation to the appropriate brain sites, and hotspot boundaries emerge by comparing the plume maps for microinjection sites that successfully enhanced ‘liking’ to surrounding sites that failed (Fig. 3). 2.7. Larger opioid sea of ‘wanting’ in nucleus accumbens The same hotspot microinjections of DAMGO or anandamide also stimulate ‘wanting’ or eating of food. But ‘wanting’ mechanisms extend far beyond hedonic hotspots. For example, the opioid hedonic hotspot comprises a mere 10% of the entire nucleus accumbens, and even only 30% of its medial shell. Yet DAMGO microinjections throughout the entire 100% of medial shell potently increased ‘wanting’, more than doubling the amount of food intake. Peciña found that DAMGO enhanced ‘wanting’ as effectively even at a more posterior ‘coldspot’ where the same microinjections suppressed ‘liking’ for sweetness. Widely spread opioid mechanisms for ‘wanting’ in the nucleus accumbens is consistent with previous findings that opioids stimulate food ‘wanting’ throughout the entire nucleus accumbens and even in outside structures that include amygdala or neostriatum [48,50,52,78,79]. Thus the appetitincreasing zone is much larger than the pleasure hotspot: it is as though a large sea of ‘wanting’ opioid systems fill the shell of nucleus accumbens, and contains a smaller opioid island that can simultaneously enhance ‘liking’ for the same reward [53]. The anatomical dissociation of ‘liking’ (only in the hotspot) from ‘wanting’ (entire nucleus accumbens) means that the brain's pleasure network does not extend to the entire opioid limbic system that stretches throughout much of the forebrain",

Instead, opioid activation enhances taste pleasure at only some of the limbic sites where it stimulates the motivation to consume palatable foods. The parallel situation for endocannabinoids is still less clear, as the only mapping study of the anandamide hedonic hotspot in shell so far found marked co-extension of ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ anatomically, and so more remains to be done. 2.8.

Studies by Kyle Smith have identified a second opioid hedonic hotspot within the ventral pallidum [54,55,76,80]. Knowledge about the anatomy of the brain region that contains ventral pallidum has grown in recent years [52,55,81–85]. Until about 10 years ago the ventral pallidum was known sometimes as part of the substantia innominata, or brain substance without a name, and earlier than 20 years ago it was often mistaken for part of the lateral hypothalamus. Today it has a name, actually several names that correspond to different divisions of this intriguing part of the ventral forebrain. The chief names today include ‘ventral pallidum’ containing the part known to cause ‘liking’ for sensory pleasure, ‘basal nucleus’ for an acetylcholine-rich anterior zone involved in attention, and ‘sublenticular extended amygdala’ for a bit behind that lies between ventral pallidum and lateral hypothalamus (the extended amygdala also contains the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis stretching back toward the central amygdala)",

    "chunk_text": ". As limbic signals leave the nucleus accumbens, the two heaviest projections may be posteriorly to two nearby neighbors, the ventral pallidum and lateral hypothalamus. Of these two structures, the lateral hypothalamus has long been the most famous for roles in food intake and food reward. But my colleagues and I believe the ventral pallidum may be even more important, at least for ‘liking’ food rewards [54,55,76,80,86]. What seems to me to be an astounding fact is that the ventral pallidum and its environs contains the only brain region known so far where the death of neurons abolishes all ‘liking’ and replaces with ‘disliking’ even for sweetness (at least for several weeks) [87]. This assertion may surprise readers who remember learning that the lateral hypothalamus is a site where lesions cause aversion (or who remember that decerebrates show ‘liking’ reactions), so some explanation is in order. Lesions of the lateral hypothalamus have long been known to disrupt eating and drinking behaviors, sending food and water intakes to zero [88,89]. After electrolytic lesions to lateral hypothalamus, rats starve to death unless given intensive nursing care and artificial intra-gastric feeding. Decades ago, lateral hypothalamic lesions were thought not only to abolish food ‘wanting’, but also to abolish food ‘liking’ too. Even sweet tastes were reported to elicit bittetype disliking reactions [88,90,91]. However, it appears that lateral hypothalamus may have been blamed through a case of mistaken identity for the effects of lesions that actually stretched beyond it in lateral and anterior directions. Those large lesions of the 1960s and 1970s typically damaged the ventral pallidum too",

An early lesion mapping study of aversion by Schallert and Whishaw attempted to identify the precise location for lesion-induced aversion, before the ventral pallidum was recognized to exist as a distinct limbic structure, and reported that sucrose ‘liking’ was replaced by sucrose ‘disliking’ only if the lesion was in the anterior zone of lateral hypothalamus — and not if the lesion was in the posterior part of lateral hypothalamus, where it would produce loss of eating and drinking, but leave ‘liking’ reactions essentially normal [90]. A subsequent lesion mapping study by Howard Cromwell in our laboratory used a more precise neuron-counting method to quantify excitotoxin lesions and recognized the existence of ventral pallidum, and therefore aimed to identify more carefully the boundaries of where neuron death actually caused aversion, by explicitly comparing ventral pallidum to lateral hypothalamus. Cromwell found that the ‘disliking’ lesions actually had to be so far anterior and lateral that they escaped the boundaries of the lateral hypothalamus itself — and lay in the structure further anterior or lateral, namely the ventral pallidum [87]. Essentially these lesions seem to disinhibit other aversion-generating systems of the forebrain, so what remains is ‘disliking’ for everything. Ventral pallidum can also generate enhancement of natural pleasure when it is intact, by opioid stimulation of its own hedonic hotspot [54,80].

The ventral pallidum is somewhat cigar shaped. If you hold out your hands as if grasping a small steering wheel in front of your waist, your two forearms are in approximately in the same orientations relative to your upright body as your left ventral pallidum and right ventral pallidum are in your brain. An elongated structure pointing forward slightly down and inward, the opioid hedonic hotspot is the posterior one-third corresponding to the two or 3 inches of your forearm nearest the elbow. The elbow zone is the posterior ventral pallidum that contains the hedonic hotspot. Studies by Kyle Smith in our lab identified the ventral pallidum hotspot and showed that in it microinjections of the opioid agonist DAMGO caused sucrose taste to elicit over twice as many ‘liking’ reactions as it normally did [54]. Opioid activation in the posterior ventral pallidum increased the hedonic impact of the natural taste reward, and also caused rats to eat over twice as much food. If the same opioid microinjections were moved anteriorly outside the hotspot toward the front of the ventral pallidum, it actually suppressed hedonic ‘liking’ reactions to sucrose and suppressed food intake too [54]. These effects seem consistent with the findings of several other laboratories on the importance of ventral pallidum in food and drug and other rewards [92–98]. A final reason to suppose that ventral pallidum mediates hedonic impact of ‘liked’ sensations is that the activity of neurons in the posterior hedonic hotspot appears to code ‘liking’ for sweet, salty and other food rewards [19,44,92,93,99–101]. In rats, recording electrodes can be permanently implanted in the ventral pallidum, and neurons there fire faster when rats eat a sweet taste.

For example, the same neurons will not fire to an intensely salty solution that is unpleasant (three-times saltier than seawater). However, the neurons suddenly begin to fire to the triplseawater taste if a physiological state of ‘salt appetite’ is induced in the rats, by administering hormones that cause the body to need more salt, and which increase the perceived ‘liking’ for intensely salty taste [101]. Thus neurons in the ventral pallidum code taste pleasure in away that is sensitive to the physiological need of the moment. When a taste becomes more pleasant during a particular physiological hunger, in a hedonic shift called ‘alliesthesia’, the ventral pallidum neurons code the increase in salty pleasure. The observation that those hedonic neurons are in the same hedonic hotspot where opioid activation causes increased ‘liking’ reactions to taste suggests that their firing rate might actually be part of the causal mechanism that paints the pleasure gloss onto taste sensation. Conversely, in humans, the sight of disgustingly rotten food has been reported to especially activate the anterior portion of ventral pallidum where in rats microinjections of DAMGO would actually suppress ‘liking’ reactions and reduce eating behavior, more than the posterior hotspot [93]. 3. ‘Wanting’ without ‘liking’ Quite different from hotspots for ‘liking’ generation has been the revelation that some previously-thought hedonic brain mechanisms actually fail to live up to that role, and turn out instead to mediate only the motivational ‘wanting’ to eat, without mediating hedonic ‘liking’ for the same food at all. One example was already described: the opioid sea of pure wanting in nucleus accumbens outside the hedonic hotspot. There are now many other examples as well",

The phenomenon of ‘wanting’ without ‘liking’ opens up fascinating possibilities for what might be called irrational desires that could underlie some pathologies of appetite [21]. In my opinion, perhaps the most famous is dopamine, which was once thought to be a pleasure neurotransmitter. The mesolimbic dopamine projection arises from neurons in the midbrain ventral tegmental area that project up to the nucleus accumbens in the forebrain [102]. Dopamine release is triggered by pleasant foods and many other pleasant rewards, and Berridge Page 9 Physiol Behav . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 July 14. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript dopamine neurons themselves fire more to pleasant food (especially when the reward is suddenly and unexpectedly received) and their predictive cues [33,103–110]. Beyond correlative activations by rewards, the causal importance of dopamine in some aspect of reward is seen in the well-known observation that drugs that are rewarding or addictive typically cause dopamine activation — either directly or by acting on other neurochemical systems that in turn cause dopamine activation [8,111]. Conversely, dopamine suppression reduces the degree to which animals and people seem to want rewarding foods, or rewards of other types [7,49,112]. Everyone therefore agrees that dopamine causes some aspect of reward, but argument persists on which aspect it mediates [113–116]. I will focus below on hypotheses that dopamine causes ‘liking’ or ‘wanting’ for food rewards, and only note in passing that a third popular hypothesis is that dopamine causes reward learning [33,117,118]. That hypothesis is of interest for the neuroscience of reward prediction, but has not been applied much to explaining food appetite or eating disorders",

The learning hypothesis for dopamine therefore will not be discussed here, though I and others have recently discussed it elsewhere [33,104,113,114,116,119,120]. The suppression of reward ‘wanting’ by dopamine blockade or loss gave rise decades ago to the idea that dopamine must also mediate reward ‘liking’ [121]. The view of most neuroscientists has shifted subsequently, although some correlative evidence collected in recent years can still be viewed as consistent with the original dopamine pleasure hypothesis of reward. For example, PET neuroimaging studies have suggested that obese people may have lower levels of dopamine D2 receptor-binding in their brains' striatum than others [122,123]. At first take, if one supposes that dopamine causes pleasure, then reduced dopamine receptors in obese individuals can be viewed as reducing the pleasure they get from food. By that view, reduced pleasure has been suggested to cause those individuals to eat more food in a quest to regain normal amounts of pleasure. A difficulty may arise for this account in that it also seems to require that the less people like a food the more they will eat it. Instead, humans and rats all tend to eat less of food that is unpalatable, and to eat more of palatable treats. Otherwise people might consume oatmeal and broccoli much more avidly than ice cream, if people compensated for hedonic dilution by wanting to eat more of what gave them less pleasure. In general, much evidence from psychology and neuroscience evidence indicates that reducing how much a food is ‘liked’ usually reduces how much it is ‘wanted’, rather than increasing its pursuit and consumption [48,78,124–126]",

Still, one might perhaps rescue this dopamine anhedonia account of D2 signalling decrement by supposing that all other life pleasures are reduced even more by dopamine receptor suppression than food pleasure, so that food remains the only pleasure available. However, we can see that actually getting an increase in food consumption from reduced pleasure via any known neuro-psychological system of food reward may prove trickier than first appears. So alternatives are worth entertaining too. A reverse interpretation of reduced dopamine D2 binding in obese people is that the reduction is a consequence of overeating and obesity, rather than its cause. As a parallel example, over-consumption of drug rewards that provide increased stimulation to dopamine receptors eventually causes the receptors to reduce in number, even if dopamine receptors were normal to begin with — this is a down-regulation mechanism of drug tolerance and withdrawal [111]. That makes it conceivable that similar sustained oveactivation of dopamine systems by over-eating food rewards in obese individuals perhaps could cause a similar eventual down-regulation of their dopamine receptors. In a related vein, other physiological aspects of pre-existing obesity states might also send excessive signals to brain systems sensitive to body weight, which indirectly cause reduction of D2 receptor as a negative feedback consequence or a sort of long-term satiety signal that down-regulates incentive systems. These speculative alternatives are enough to illustrate that possibilities exist by which Berridge Page 10 Physiol Behav . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 July 14.

Current D2 binding drugs attach to both high and low modes, but only receptors in the high mode may actually contribute to the transmission of dopamine signals. Further, sometimes high and low populations change in opposite directions. That raises the possibility some individuals so far reported to have reduced D2 signalling related to total population suppression (mostly in low mode) might actually turn out to have a higher proportion of receptors in high mode, and therefore possess an elevation in functional higmediated dopamine signalling despite overall reduction in receptors (perhaps the former might even contribute to the latter) [127,128]. Future research will be needed to resolve these fascinating issues regarding D2 receptors and dopamine signalling. If we turn to animal studies in which dopamine's causal roles have been manipulated, then dopamine does not appear to be important for ‘liking’ the hedonic impact of food rewards after all. For example, mutant mice that lack any dopamine in their brains have been argued to still register the hedonic impact of sucrose or food rewards, in that their preference or learning about a palatable reward remains [129,130]. Similarly, taste reactivity studies have shown that dopamine suppression or complete lesion in normal rats does not suppress taste ‘liking’ facial expressions elicited by the taste of sucrose [7,131]. Instead, the hedonic impact of sweetness remains robust even in a nearly dopamine-free forebrain (also, still robust is the ability to learn some new reward values for a sweet taste, which indicates that forebrain ‘liking’ systems remain in control of ‘liking’ expressions after loss of 99% of accumbensstriatal dopamine) [7]",

Conversely, too much dopamine in the brain, either in mutant mice whose gene mutation causes extra dopamine to remain in synapses or in ordinary rats given amphetamine in nucleus accumbens that causes dopamine release (or that have drug-sensitized dopamine systems), show elevated ‘wanting’ for sweet food rewards, but no elevation in ‘liking’ expressions to the taste of sweet rewards [19,20,132]. All of these brain manipulations make animals ‘want’ to eat food more, though they fail to make the animals ‘like’ food more (and sometimes even make them ‘like’ it less). It may be important to note that a dopamine role in ‘wanting’ for food does not mean that dopamine-related systems must be constantly active in a hungry individual [133]. Continuous hyperactivity is different from hyper-reactivity. It only suggests that food cues may elicit higher reactions in dopamine-related brain circuits. Simultaneous presence of cues and hunger states (or drug states) can be needed to reveal amplification of incentive salience in neural and behavioral experiments [20,134], and may be important to reveal dopamine increases and related limbic activations [35,135,136]. This reflects the nature of incentive salience as a cutriggered incentive process, rather than a constant drive [137–139]. Important confirmation that dopamine mediates ‘wanting’ but not ‘liking’ may now be coming from neuroimaging studies of humans, especially those that manipulate dopamine signalling with drugs, which report that dopamine release triggered when people encounter a food or drug reward may better correlate to their subjective ratings of wanting the reward than to their pleasure ratings of liking the same reward [36,140]. Similarly, in humans, drugs that block dopamine receptors may completely fail to reduce the subjective pleasure ratings that people give to a reward stimulus such as amphetamine [141–144]",

Thus, the idea that dopamine is a pleasure neurotransmitter has faded considerably in the neuroscience literature, with only a few hedonia pockets remaining (though dopamine seems important to ‘wanting’ rewards, even if not to ‘liking’ rewards). Separating true ‘liking’ Berridge Page 11 Physiol Behav . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 July 14. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript substrates from false ones is a useful step in identifying the real affective neural circuits for hedonic processes in the brain. Why did brains evolve separate ‘wanting’ and ‘liking’ mechanisms for the same reward? One speculative possibility is that, originally, ‘wanting’ might have evolved first as an elementary form of goal directedness to pursue particular innate incentives even in advance of experience of their hedonic effects. Later, as hedonic and associative mechanisms evolved, ‘wanting’ became harnessed to work with them in extending ‘wanting’ to learned stimuli associated with ‘liked’ rewards [16,33,124,139]. Another evolutionary pressure that may have promoted a distinct mechanism for ‘wanting’ is the need for a common neural currency of incentive salience shared by all rewards, which could compare and help decide choices for competing rewards of food, sex, and other incommensurate types of pleasure that might each involve partly distinct neural ‘liking’ circuits [1,145]. The important point is that ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ normally go together, but they can be split apart under certain circumstances, especially by certain brain manipulations. 3.1",

Connecting brain reward, stress and regulatory systems A related fascinating topic, though beyond my present scope, is the interaction between brain systems of ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ reward, on the one hand, with hypothalamic-focused hunger and body weight regulation mechanisms on the other In the phenomenon of alliesthesia, hedonic ‘liking’ for food reward, as well as motivational ‘wanting’ to eat, can be enhanced by hunger and diminished by satiety [38,101,110,146–150]. Another important topic is how stress systems interact with brain reward systems [151–155]. Though also beyond current reach, it is interesting to note that CRF stimulation in nucleus accumbens magnifies cue-triggered ‘wanting’ similarly to dopamine stimulation, making sugar cues trigger much higher bursts of ‘wanting’ expressed as more lever pressing in rats [154]. Stress-induced amplification of incentive salience mechanisms could contribute to binge eating when stress and food cues combine together [152]. How do reward and regulatory brain systems connect and influence each other? Great progress has been made in recent years toward understanding these neural interactions. Control signals go back and forth between mesocorticolimbic reward systems and hypothalamic regulation systems [45,126,133,147,156–164]. For example, hypothalamic orexin–hypocretin neurons send projections to modulate the nucleus accumbens in ways that might allow hunger states to enhance food reward [165], and even interact with other rewards such as drugs [160]. In return, nucleus accumbens influences hypothalamic circuits. For example, manipulations of nucleus accumbens that cause increased food intake and that modulate reward, such as GABA microinjections into the medial shell, send descending signals that activate orexin neurons in the hypothalamus [166–168]",

Neuroscientists have only begun to understand the nature and role of interactions between mesolimbic reward systems and hypothalamic hunger systems, but recent developments show that such interactions exist and are of great importance. They undoubtedly play major roles in alliesthesia modulation of the pleasure and incentive value of food rewards during normal hunger versus satiety states, possibly also in connecting reward modulation to longer-term body weight elevation and dieting states, and finally perhaps even in allowing food reward cues to influence the activation of hunger deficit systems. These interactions also provide avenues, at least in principle, by which eating disorders cause distortion in the function of reward systems, so that they become either exaggerated or suppressed in function. Such interactions will be important to try to understand better in the future. Berridge Page 12 Physiol Behav . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 July 14.

Potential roles of brain reward systems in eating disorders So how do ‘wanting’ and ‘liking’ relate to human eating disorders? At least in principle, we can sketch several alternative possibilities in principle for how brain reward systems might function in any particular eating disorder. Comparison of these alternatives may help to frame the issue. The idea of food addiction will not be adequately discussed here (and will only briefly touch upon potential brain mechanisms). Researchers who deal with eating disorders are best positioned to judge whether there are in fact food addictions, and what are the criteria that allow the use of this term. It is an important question whether food addiction exists as comparable to drug addiction or instead is simply a shorthand for eating patterns pushed to an extreme [169–171]. The debate largely focuses on whether particular addiction processes, such as withdrawal or sensitization, actually occur in eating disorders",

It might also be relevant to think about whether eating disorders share addictive features of behavior that can help distinguish a compulsion, such as persistence in the face of adverse costs or escalation of intensity in binge/purge patterns (though constraints such as stomach size place stricter limits on food intake, by comparison to drug intake that is relatively free to escalate). Further, it is also important to acknowledge that other psychological and cultural factors are involved in eating disorders, beyond reward-related or regulatory processes. Concepts such as a focus on thinness and associations with OCD have explanatory power for certain anorexia and other eating disorders. Mesolimbic mechanisms involved in food reward, including dopamine, might contribute to generating obsessive dreads as well as obsessive desires (perhaps such as a focus on avoiding weight gain and remaining thin), and mesolimbic desires and dreads can even co-exist or feed off one another [155,172,173]. Still, eating disorders also likely involve much more elaborate cognitive, psychodynamic, and cultural processes that are simply beyond the present scope. Yet brain reward mechanisms still remain of interest in under-standing eating disorders (Fig. 5). It may be useful to sketch out several alternatives for how they might relate to a particular disorder. 4.1. Reward dysfunction as cause First, it is possible that some aspects of brain reward function may go wrong and actually cause an eating disorder. Foods might become hedonically ‘liked’ too much or too little via reward dysfunction. For example, pathological over-activation of the opioid or endocannabinoid hedonic hotspots in nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum might cause enhanced ‘liking’ reaction to taste pleasure in some individuals",

An endogenously produced increase in opioid tone there could in principle magnify the hedonic impact of foods, making an individual ‘like’ food more than other people, and ‘want’ to eat more. Conversely, a suppressive form of hotspot dysfunction might reduce ‘liking’ or even create ‘disliking’ for a normally palatable food. Or incentive salience ‘wanting’ to eat might detach from normal close association with hedonic ‘liking’, leading to changes in motivated food consumption that are no longer hedonically driven. Activation of mesolimbic dopamine mechanisms of incentive salience, or even opioid ‘wanting’ circuits outside the hedonic hotspots, could cause ‘wanting’ without ‘liking’ similar to the animal studies described above. If eating disorders involve a pathology specifically in incentive salience ‘wanting’, such an individual could ‘want’ to eat food that they cognitively do not want to eat at all, and without enhancement of ‘liking’. In such cases, the sight, smell, or vivid imagination of food could trigger a compulsive urge to eat, even though the person would not expect it to be very pleasurable, nor find the actual experience very pleasurable in the end. Neural sensitization of incentive salience systems, if it truly happens in any eating Berridge Page 13 Physiol Behav . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 July 14. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript disorder, might be one way by which excessive ‘wanting’ to eat could generate excessive food intake. Or yet again, suppression of positive hedonic reward systems or activation of dysphoric stress systems might prompt persistent attempts to self-medicate by eating palatable food. All of these possibilities have been suggested at one time or another. Each of them deserves consideration because different answers might apply to different disorders. 4.2",

Passively distorted reward function as consequence As a second category of possibilities, brain reward systems might remain intrinsically normal and have no essential pathology in eating disorders, but still become distorted in function as a passive secondary consequence of disordered intake. In that case, brain systems of ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ might well attempt to function normally. The abnormal feedback from physiological signals that are altered by binges of eating or by periods of anorexia might induce reward dysfunction as a consequence of the behavioral disorder that arose from other causes. This would provide a potential red herring to researchers for causes of the eating disorder, because brain abnormalities might appear as neural markers for a particular disorder, but be mistaken as causes when they were actually consequences. However, it might still provide a window of opportunity for pharmacological treatments that aimed to correct eating behavior in part by modulating reward function back to a normal range. 4.3. Normal resilience in brain reward Third, it is possible that most aspects of brain reward systems will function even more normally than suggested by the passively distorted consequence model above. Many compensatory changes can take place in response to physiological alterations, to oppose them via homeostatic or negative feedback corrections. The final consequence of those compensations might restore normality to brain reward functions. In such cases, the causes of eating disorder might then be found to lie completely outside brain reward functions. Indeed, brain reward functions will persist largely normally, and may even serve as aids to eventually help spontaneously normalize eating behavior even without treatment.

Practical consequences of theoretical possibilities It is important to strive toward discovering which answers are most correct for particular disorders or subtypes, because those answers carry implications for what treatment strategy might be best. For example, should one try to restore normal eating by reversing brain reward dysfunction via medications to correct the underlying problem? That would be appropriate if reward dysfunction is the underlying cause. Or should one use drugs instead only as compensating medications, not cures? Such a medication might aim to boost aspects of brain reward function and so correct eating, even though it may not address the original underlying cause? For example, just as aspirin often helps treat pain, even though the original cause of pain was never a deficit in endogenous aspirin, so a medication that altered reward systems might still help to oppose whatever original underlying factors are altering eating, even though it will not reverse those causal factors. Or instead should treatment be focused entirely on separate brain or peripheral targets that are unrelated to food reward? That might be the best choice if brain reward systems simply remain normal in all cases of eating disorders, and thus perhaps essentially irrelevant to the expression of pathological eating behavior.

And only if we can recognize reward pathology when it occurs will we be able to judge which of the possibilities above best applies to a particular eating disorder. 4.5. Addictions and incentive sensitization Perhaps a bit more should be said about the possibility of excessive ‘wanting’ without commensurate ‘liking’. Could over-activation of ‘wanting’ mechanisms in certain individuals lead to actual addiction to food and over-eating similar to the compulsive pursuit of drugs in drug addiction? For some human drug addicts, real-life ‘wanting’ without ‘liking’ may occur due to long-lasting sensitization of their brain mesolimbic systems induced by repeated binging on heroin, cocaine or related drugs. Addicts sometimes take drugs compulsively even when they do not derive much pleasure from them [8,128]. For example, nicotine fails to produce great sensory pleasure in many people, but still can be quite addictive even in those cases. In early 1990s, Terry Robinson and I proposed the incentive-sensitization theory of addiction to explain such compulsive ‘wanting’ by combining incentive salience and neural sensitization concepts [9,22]. The theory does not deny that drug pleasure, withdrawal, or habits are all reasons people sometimes take drugs, but suggests that something else, sensitized ‘wanting’, may be needed in order to understand why addiction becomes so motivationally compulsive and long-lasting. Many addictive drugs cause neural sensitization in the brain mesocorticolimbic systems (e.g., cocaine, heroin, amphetamine, alcohol, nicotine). Sensitization means that the brain system can be triggered into abnormally high levels of activation by drugs or related stimuli. Sensitization is nearly the opposite of drug tolerance",

Sensitization is nearly the opposite of drug tolerance. Different processes within the same brain systems can simultaneously instantiate both sensitization (e.g., via increase in dopamine release) and tolerance (e.g., via decrease in dopamine receptors) [9,22,111,174]. However, tolerance mechanisms usually recover within days to weeks once drugs are given up, whereas neural sensitization can last for years. If the incentive-sensitization theory is true for drug addiction, it helps explain why addicts may sometimes even ‘want’ to take drugs that they do not particularly ‘like’. The long-lasting nature of neural sensitization may also help explain why recovered addicts, who have been drug-free and out of withdrawal for months or years, are still sometimes liable to relapse back into addiction even if not expecting to gain much pleasure from their relapse. Sensitization of incentive salience does not mean that addicts ‘want’ all rewards more in a general fashion. ‘Wanting’ increases instead are highly specific to particular rewards and particular moments, often linked to encounters with cues for the ‘wanted’ reward [19,175]. This directional specificity may relate to why a drug addict particularly ‘wants’ drug, whereas someone with an eating disorder might particularly ‘want’ food, especially upon encounters with cues for the person's most ‘wanted’ reward. 4.6. Is there a neural sensitization role in food addictions? Could incentive-sensitization apply to food addictions too? Several investigators have suggested that sensitization-like changes in brain systems are indeed produced by exposure to certain regimens of food and restriction that model oscillations between dieting and binging on palatable foods [176–183]",

If brain mesolimbic sensitization caused by binge eating truly exists, it gives a bit more reality to the possibility of food addictions. However, some caution may be in order before concluding that food binging creates limbic sensitization of ‘wanting’ similar to drug addiction. There are several alternative explanations for some of the evidence, which could interact with sensitization or perhaps even masquerade as limbic sensitization under some conditions. For example, repeated binging on a palatable food is likely to induce strong Pavlovian conditioning, creating strong conditioned incentive stimuli. Hunger itself also promotes mesolimbic activation in response to reward under some conditions [103,186–190].During normal hunger, sucrose tastes more pleasant than when one is full (alliesthesia) [191] and foods of all sorts become more motivating as incentives",

Finally, evolutionary psychologists might suggest that brains would be well adapted to naturally increase the propensity to overeat when-ever possible if faced with an environment of scarce resources, a situation mimicked by intermittent deprivation. These factors could snowball together to increase intake, and the resulting picture might look a bit like sensitization, without actually being it. This is not to discount the possibility that real sensitization might still occur induced by diebinge cycles or similar exposure regimens, nor to deny that the studies mentioned above might be examples of food incentive-sensitization. Sensitization-like states do indeed seem to be implicated by certain types of physiological deprivation regimens [192,193]. It only means that caution may be needed going forward. Otherwise we could be fooled into thinking sensitization has occurred when it has not, and be led to posit ‘food addiction’ when not really necessary. 4.7. What happens in actual human eating disorders Whether actual obesity or human eating disorders such as or anorexia nervosa or binge eating in bulimia involve abnormal ‘liking’ or ‘wanting’ is an empirical question to be answered by studies of people with those conditions. The question has begun to receive thoughtful attention from a number of investigators [157,161,163,194]. At present, the data is still not entirely clear, and sometimes even a bit contradictory. Most fundamentally, there is still debate about whether food addictions really exist [169–171]. Still, distortions of reward could conceivably contribute to some eating disorders. In principle, ‘liking’ might be altered in some individuals. In human obesity, some individuals who are obese have some-times been reported to give higher pleasantness ratings to palatable foods than other individuals [195,196]",

However, when people merely tasted and spit the foods in a recent ‘sham feeding’ study, no difference was found in wanting or liking ratings between obese and other individuals [197]. Alternatively, ‘wanting’ might dissociate via separate alteration. Food ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ can dissociate somewhat even in normal situations, which eating disorders might exaggerate. For example, humans who eat repeated bits of chocolate to satiation report stronger declines in ratings of wanting the final bit of chocolate than in ratings of liking it [35] (and higher Berridge Page 16 Physiol Behav . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 July 14. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript malleability of wanting than liking also seems consistent with animal studies of alliesthesia) [198]. 5. Conclusion For most people, eating patterns and body weights remain within normally prescribed bounds. Perhaps it is the prevalence of normal body weights, rather than obesity, that should be most surprising in affluent modern societies where tasty foods abound. As is often pointed out, brain mechanisms for food reward and appetite evolved under pressures to protect us from scarcity. As a result, overeating in the face of present abundance could be an understandable overshoot inherited from our evolutionary past. Indeed, facing modern temptations, it is impressive how many people remain in normal weight range today. When eating patterns and body weight do diverge from the norm, questions arise concerning the involvement of food reward systems in the brain. All eating patterns are controlled intimately by brain mechanisms of food reward, whether those mechanisms operate in normal mode or abnormal modes",

A primary signpost to help guide future thinking is to know whether any pathological patterns of eating are caused by identifiable pathologies in brain reward function. Can distorted patterns of eating be corrected by medications that alter brain reward mechanisms? Or are the causes of eating disorders essentially independent of brain reward systems? These remain questions to guide future research on how brain substrates of food reward relate to eating disorders.

In addition, growing evidence shows that testosterone exposure contributes similarly to the development of other human behaviors that show sex differences, including sexual orentation, core gender identity, and some, though not all, sex-related cognitive and personality characteristics. In addition to these prenatal hormonal influences, early infancy and puberty may provide additional critical periods when hormones influence human neurobehavioral oganization. Sex-linked genes could also contribute to human gender development, and most sex-related characteristics are influenced by socialization and other aspects of postnatal experience, as well. Neral mechanisms underlying the influences of gonadal hormones on human behavior are beginning to be identified.

Indeed, the existence of behavioral sex differences implies the existence of neural sex differences, given that behavior depends on the nervous system.

    "chunk_text": ". This article focuses on the role of gonadal hormones, particularly testosterone, during early development. This focus has been chosen because extensive experimental research in nonhuman mamals shows that testosterone exerts powerful influences on both gender-related behavior and the developing brain and because recent research provides convincing evidence that testosterone exerts similar influences on human development. The article critically reviews the evidence of prenatal hormonal influences on human neurobehavioral sexual differentiation and contextualizes these hormonal effects with genetic, social, and cognitive influences on gender development. It also critically reviews the evidence regarding possible neural changes underlying hormonal influences on human behavior and suggests that neural systems siilar to those influenced by hormones underlie other types of influences on gendered behavior. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION Gender development begins at conception with the union of two X chromosomes (genetic female) or an X and a Y chromosome (genetic male). The main role of these sex chromosomes in human sexual differentiation is to determine whether the gonads become testes or ovaries (Arnold 2009). Genetic information on the Y chromosome leads to testicular differentiation (Wilson et al. 1981), whereas without the Y chromosome, ovaries develop instead of testes. The testes begin to produce testosterone prenatally, and the ovaries do not (Wilson et al. 1981). Consequently, male and female fetuses differ in the amount of testosterone to which they are exposed. This sex difference appears to be maximal between about weeks 8 and 24 of human gestation, with testosterone in males tapering off before birth (Carson et al. 1982, Reyes et al. 1973)",

This sex difference appears to be maximal between about weeks 8 and 24 of human gestation, with testosterone in males tapering off before birth (Carson et al. 1982, Reyes et al. 1973). In nonhuman mammals at comparable stages of early development, testosterone and hormones produced from testosterone influence neural survival, neuranatomical connectivity, and neurochemical specification, producing sex differences in brain structure and function (McCarthy et al. 2009). These effects of testosterone on neural development provide powerful mechanisms for influencing behavior across the life span. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011.34:69-88.

Rough-and-tumble play: juvenile behavior characterized by overall body contact or playful aggression; more common in males than in females SDN-POA: sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area ANIMAL MODELS OF HORMONE EFFECTS The influences of early testosterone exposure on neurobehavioral development were first documented in a landmark study by Phoenix et al. (1959). They showed that administering testosterone to pregnant guinea pigs produced female offspring who showed increased capacity for male-typical sexual behavior and decreased capacity for female-typical sexual behavior in adulthood (Phoenix et al. 1959). Phoenix et al. contrasted these early, and permanent, effects of hormones, which they called organizational because they were thought to reflect changes in the organization of neural systems, with the later, and transient, effects of hormones after puberty, which they called activational because they were thought to reflect transient activation of the previously organized systems",

This orgnizational/activational distinction has stood up well in the subsequent 50 some years (Arnold 2009), and thousands of studies on numerous species, including not only guinea pigs, but also rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, ferrets, dogs, sheep, and marmoset and rhesus monkeys, have documented the early organizing effects of testosterone on a wide variety of behaviors that show sex differences (Hines 2004, 2009; McCarthy et al. 2009). For instance, the female offspring of rhesus macaques treated with testosterone during pregnancy show increased male-typical, and reduced female-typical, sexual behavior in adulthood, and increased male-typical, rough-and-tumble play as juvenile animals. The organizing influences of testosterone on behavioral development were originally thought to reflect subtle neural changes (Phoenix et al. 1959). Subsequent research, however, has shown that early hormone maniulations produce dramatic changes in the struture of neural regions with the relevant homone receptors. The first dramatic neural sex difference described in the rodent brain was the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA). This region of the anterior hpothalamic/preoptic area (AH/POA) is several fold larger in the adult male rat than in the adult female rat, and its volume can be altered by manipulating testosterone during early deveopment (Gorski et al. 1978, 1980). Administeing testosterone to developing female animals increases the volume of the SDN-POA, and rmoving testosterone from developing males rduces its volume (Dohler et al. 1984, Jacobson et al. 1981). Other neural regions in addition to the SDN-POA show sex differences, and in these regions too, the size of the sex difference is influenced by the early hormone environment. For instance, a second region of the preoptic area, the anteroventral paraventricular nucleus, is larger and contains more neurons in female rats than in males, and these characteristics are reduced by early testosterone treatment (Ito et al. 1986, Sumida et al. 1993)",

Similar neural sex differences have been reported in other rdent species, including gerbils, hamsters, mice, and guinea pigs, as well as in ferrets, sheep, and rhesus monkeys, and studies investigating early hormone influences have found similar results to those seen in rats, in other rodent species, and in ferrets (Bleier et al. 1982, Byne 1998, Hines et al. 1987, Roselli et al. 2004, Simerly et al. 1997, Tobet et al. 1986, Ulibarri & Yahr 1988). Some general principles can be derived from the extensive experimental work in nonhuman mammals, and these principles have informed hypotheses regarding possible hormonal inflences on human brain and behavior (see Hines 2009, for a review). First, during early deveopment, estrogens generally do not promote female-typical development. Instead, femaltypical development occurs in the absence of testicular hormones. Thus, exposure to high levels of estrogen is not expected to femininize neurobehavioral development. Second, the efects of testosterone on development are graded and linear; the more hormone the animal is exposed to, the more male-typical its behaior and brain structure become. An impliction of this principle is that gonadal hormones can contribute to individual differences within each sex, as well as to differences between the sexes.

Implications of this principle include an expectation that the many human behaviors and brain structures that differ by sex may not relate in a uniform way to one another and that individuals can develop complicated patterns of sex-typed behavior, bing masculine in some respects and feminine in others. Fourth, the effects of hormones can differ somewhat from one species to another. For instance, behaviors that are influenced in one species may not be influenced in all others. Similarly, brain regions that differ for males and females in one species may not show a sex diference in another. Thus the specific effects of gonadal steroids seen on the brain and behaior of nonhuman mammals cannot be automaically generalized to humans, as well. Instead, hypothesized neural and behavioral influences of testosterone during early development must be evaluated directly in humans. Fifth, the bhaviors and neural features that are influenced by gonadal hormones are those that show sex differences, meaning that they differ on average for males and females.

HUMAN RESEARCH Ethical considerations generally preclude eperimental manipulations of gonadal hormones in humans during early development. However, information from genetic syndromes that prduce fetal hormone abnormality, as well as from situations in which pregnant women have been prescribed hormones, and studies relating nomal variability in hormones early in life to nomal variability in subsequent behavior all sugest that hormones contribute to human gender development. The most convincing evidence of these influences has come from studies of childhood play. Why Study Children’s Play? Girls and boys differ in their toy, playmate, and activity preferences (Hines, 2010a). For exaple, boys tend to prefer toy vehicles, whereas girls tend to prefer dolls. Girls and boys also generally prefer playmates of their own sex, and boys spend more time in rough-and-tumble play than girls do. Children’s sex-typed play behavior is the aspect of human gender deveopment that has been studied most extensively in relation to the early hormone environment. This focus on childhood play reflects several considerations. First, children spend most of their time playing, and play is thought to be essential for healthy cognitive and emotional development (Ginsburg et al. 2007, Piaget 1970, Vygotsky 1976). Second, children’s sex-typed play behavior can be assessed readily and reliably. Third, large sex differences exist in children’s play, larger than those in cognitive abilities or personality characteristics (Hines 2010b), providing scope for detecting hormonal influences. Fourth, sex differences in children’s play are evident early in life and relate to other behaviors that show sex differences, including sexual orientation and gender identification (Bailey & Zucker 1995, Green 1985, Hines et al. 2004)",

Fifth, play can be assessed during a period of hormonal quiescence, allowing examination of the early and permanent organizational influences of hormones on brain development, prior to the addition of the transient, activational influences of hormones that occur after puberty. Several types of studies provide convergent evidence that testosterone concentrations prenatally influence children’s subsequent setyped toy, playmate, and activity preferences. Studies of girls exposed to unusually high levels of testosterone and other androgens before birth, because they have the genetic disorder known as classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), consistently find that these girls show increased male-typical play and reduced female-typical play (Berenbaum & Hines 1992, Dittmann et al. 1990, Ehrhardt et al. 1968, Ehrhardt & Baker 1974, Hall et al.

Similarly, children whose mothers took androgenic progestins during pregnancy have shown increased male-typical toy and activity preferences, whereas the opposite occurs in children whose mothers took antiandrogenic progestins (Ehrhardt et al. 1977, Ehrhardt & Money 1967). Is the Behavioral Alteration Caused by Hormones Acting on the Developing Brain?

Those skeptical of gonadal homone influences on human neurobehavioral dvelopment suggest that the abnormal genital appearance, rather than the neural influences of androgens, could cause behavioral masculiization (Fausto-Sterling 1992, Jordan-Young 2010). Specifically, they suggest that parents may treat their daughters differently because of the girls’ external virilization at birth and that this difference in parental treatment could ater sex-typed behavior. In addition, they sugest that virilized genitalia could reduce selidentification as female, which could in turn cause increased male-typical behavior. Some evidence suggests that parents can influence the development of children’s gender-typical behavior. For instance, parents generally encourage sex-typical play (Fagot 1978, Langlois & Downs 1980, Pasterski et al. 2005), and the amount of such encouragement has been found to correlate with the amount of sex-typed toy play, at least among typically developing children (Pasterski et al. 2005). However, parents have been found to offer more, rather than less, encouragement of sex-typical play to their daughters with CAH than to their daughters who do not have the disorder (Pasterski et al. 2005), suggesting that parental encouragement is not responsible for cross-gendered toy choices in girls with CAH. Similarly, although gender identification plays a role in children’s acquisition of genderelated behavior, at least in typically developing children (Hines 2010a, Ruble et al. 2006), it is unlikely that the male-typical behavior in girls with CAH results solely from altered gender identity based on genital virilization at birth. Evidence arguing against this explnation comes from studies relating normal variability in prenatal testosterone exposure to normal variability in subsequent behavior. Testosterone concentrations in maternal blood samples taken during pregnancy or in amniotic fluid from normally developing fetuses relate positively to male-typical childhood behavior (Auyeung et al. 2009b, Hines et al",

Because the children in these studies have nomal appearing genitalia, it is unlikely that diffeential parental socialization or changes in geder identification based on genital appearance account for the observed relationships between prenatal testosterone and postnatal behavior. Researchers have also looked at species in which children’s toys are novel objects and therefore not subject to the socialization hitories or processes of gender identification thought to explain sex-typed toy preferences in children. Two studies of nonhuman primates have reported sex-typed toy preferences similar to those seen in children. Male vervet monkeys (Alexander & Hines 2002) have been found to spend more time than females contacting toys that are typically preferred by boys (e.g., a car) and less time contacting toys that are typically preferred by girls (e.g., a doll) ( Figure 1 ). Siilarly, male rhesus monkeys have been found to prefer toys normally preferred by boys (wheeled toys) to plush toys (Hassett et al. 2008).

Evidence of inborn influences has led researchers to reevaluate this perspective and to investigate the object features that make certain toys more or less interesting to brains exposed prenatally to different amounts of testosterone. Although boys’ toys and girls’ toys differ in shape and color (boys’ toys tend to be angular and blue, whereas girls’ toys tend to be rounded and pink), sex differences in toy preferences are present in very young infants (Alexander et al. 2009b, Campbell et al. 2000, Jadva et al. 2010, Serbin et al. 2001), before sex differences in color or shape preferences are seen ( Jadva et al. 2010), suggesting that the object preferences do not result from the color or shape preferences. Another possibility is that boys like toys that can be moved in space, and prenatal androgen exposure may increase interest in watching things move in space (Alexander 2003, Alexander & Hines 2002, Hines 2004), perhaps by altering development of the visual system (Alexander 2003). Early Hormone Influences on Sexual Orientation and Core Gender Identity Adult behaviors that show sex differences, including sexual orientation and core gender identity, also appear to be influenced by prental testosterone exposure. Women with CAH not only recall more male-typical childhood behavior, but also show reduced heterosexual orientation as adults, and these two outcomes correlate (Hines et al. 2004; see MeyeBahlburg et al. 2008 for a review of additional Annu.

Nomal variability in testosterone prenatally, e.g., from maternal blood or amniotic fluid, has not yet been related to sexual orientation, but a characteristic that is thought to provide an indrect measure of prenatal testosterone exposure, the ratio of the second to the fourth digit of the hand (2D:4D), which is greater in females than in males, has been linked. A study of more than 200,000 individuals, who measured their own 2D:4D and reported their sexual orientation online, found that 2D:4D related as predicted to sexual orientation in males, but not in females (Collaer et al. 2007). A meta-analysis that did not include this large study reached a somewhat different conclusion, however, finding that 2D:4D related as predicted to sexual orienttion in females, but not in males (Grimbos et al. 2010). Finger ratios are probably a weak corrlate of prenatal testosterone exposure, perhaps explaining the somewhat inconsistent results. Women with CAH not only show reduced heterosexual interest, but also show diminished identification with the female gender, and this too correlates with their recalled childhood sex-typical behavior (Hines et al. 2004; see Hines 2010a for a review of studies of gender identity in females with CAH). About 3% of women with CAH express a desire to live as men in adulthood, despite having been reared as girls, in contrast with ∼ 0.005% of all women (Dessens et al. 2005). Although 3% may seem small, it indicates that women with CAH are ∼ 600 times more likely than women in general to experience severe gender dysphoria. Girls with other disorders involving exposure to uusually high levels of androgens prenatally also show increased gender dysphoria (Slijper et al. 1998)",

Additionally, even when not gender dysphoric, or wishing to change sex, girls and women with CAH show somewhat reduced satisfaction with the female sex assignment (Ehrhardt et al. 1968, Ehrhardt & Baker 1974, Hines et al. 2004). No evidence thus far has linked normal variability in the early hormone environment to gender dysphoria. In addition, research attempting to link 2D:4D to geder identification has produced inconsistent findings (Kraemer et al. 2009, Schneider et al. 2006, Wallien et al. 2008), again perhaps because of the weak relationship between 2D:4D and prenatal androgen exposure. Early Hormone Influences on Personality and Cognition Sex differences in personality characteristics and in cognitive ability are smaller than are sex differences in children’s sex-typed actiities, sexual orientation, or gender identity (Hines 2010b). Nevertheless, they also have been examined for evidence of early hormonal influence. Some personality characteristics that show sex differences relate to prenatal testosterone exposure. For instance, empathy, which is higher on average in females than in males, appears to be reduced by testosterone expsure before birth. Females with CAH show reduced empathy (Mathews et al. 2009), and testosterone measured in amniotic fluid relates negatively to empathy in both boys and girls (Chapman et al. 2006). Tendencies toward physical aggression, which are higher on average in males than in females, also relate to prenatal testosterone exposure, with prenatal testosterone exposure increasing aggression. Girls and women with CAH show increased physical aggression (Mathews et al. 2009, Pasterski et al. 2007), as do children exposed prenatally to androgenic progestins (Reinisch 1981).

For instance, the study that reported increased aggression and reduced empathy in females with CAH also considered the personality dimension of dominance/assertiveness, which is higher on average in males than in females. Despite seeing the expected sex difference in healthy controls, no difference in dominance/assertiveness was seen between females with and without CAH. Cognitive and motor abilities that show sex differences also have been examined for inflences of prenatal testosterone exposure (rviewed in Hines 2010a). One study found that Annu. Rev.

Some studies have also found that females with CAH resemble males in showing enhanced mental rotations performance, but other studies have not corroborated these results (Hines et al. 2003). Two studies found that males with CAH show reduced performance on mental rotations or other visuo-spatial tasks (Hampson et al. 1998, Hines et al. 2003), results that had not been predicted. Several studies have also found that both males and females with CAH show impaired performance on arithmetic and mathematical tests (Baker & Ehrhardt 1974, Perlman 1973, Sinforiani et al. 1994), despite males generally being viewed as better than females at mathematics. Studies relating amniotic fluid testosterone to spatial and mathematical performance have also prduced inconsistent and largely negative results (Finegan et al. 1992, Grimshaw et al. 1995)",

Most studies have found no alterations in idividuals with CAH on tasks at which females excel, such as verbal fluency or perceptual speed, although one study suggests reduced female-typical behavior in females with CAH in the form of impaired fine motor perfomance (Collaer et al. 2009). Perhaps prenatal testosterone exposure has a clearer impact on motor abilities that show sex differences (e.g., targeting and fine motor performance) than on cognitive abilities assessed with paper-and-pencil tests. Socialization and Sex Differences in Cognitive Performance Substantial evidence supports social and cultural influences on some cognitive sex differences (see Hines 2010a for a review). For instance, sex differences on certain measures of cognitive abilities appear to have declined over time (Feingold 1988). For the SAT Mathmatics, in particular, the sex ratio among those scoring at the upper extreme has declined from 13 boys to one girl in 1982 to 2.8 boys to 1 girl more recently (Halpern et al. 2007). There are also large national differences in mathematical and science performance, differences that are many fold larger than the sex difference within any nation (Mullis et al. 2008). Additionally, the magnitude of the sex difference in mathematics performance within a nation relates to the role of women. Nations where women and men are similar in regard to variables such as reresentation in the legislature show more equal mathematics performance (Guiso et al. 2008).

For example, prenatal testosterone exposure has been suggested to contribute to autistic spectrum conditions (ASC) (Baron-Cohen 2002) and to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette Sydrome (Alexander & Peterson 2004), and to be protective against eating disorders (Culbert et al. 2008, Klump et al. 2006). For OCD and Tourette syndrome, evidence that individuals with these disorders are more male-typical in other respects, such as childhood play behavior, has been interpreted to support a link to testosterone (Alexander & Peterson 2004). For ASC (Auyeung et al. 2009a, Chapman et al. 2006, Knickmeyer et al. 2006) and for eating disorders (Culbert et al. 2008, Klump et al. 2006), behaviors in the normal range that are similar to those seen in the disorders (e.g., empathy for ASC, disordered eating for eating disorders) have been linked to prenatal adrogens, although for disordered eating, some studies have failed to replicate these results (Raevuori et al. 2008). In addition, for ASC and for eating disorders, studies have not shown that variability in the early hormone enviroment leads to the disorder itself, as opposed to behaviors in the normal range that resemble those that characterize the disorder.

The proposed link between prenatal testosterone and ASC has also been questioned by evidence indicating that both males and females with gender identity disorder, rather than females only, are at increased risk of ASC (de Vries et al. 2010) and by the larger male predominance for the less severe ASC, Asperger syndrome, than for the more severe ASC, classical autism. One possibility is that prenatal androgen exposure contributes to individual differences within the normal range in behaviors that show sex differences and that some of these resemble behaviors associated with developmental disoders, such as ASC. As a consequence, exposure to testosterone before birth, when added to other risk factors, could contribute to some individuals crossing a threshold for diagnosis. However, developmental disorders are one area in which direct genetic effects (Skuse 2006), particularly those of genes encoded in the X and Y chromosomes (Reinius et al. 2008, Reinius & Jazin 2009, Skuse 2006), may play an important role. Sex Differences in Brain Structure and Function There are numerous reports of sex differences in human brain structure or function (reviewed by Cahill 2009, Hines 2009). For instance, total brain volume, like body size, is larger in males than females. In addition, the amygdala is larger in males, whereas the hippocampus is larger in females (Goldstein et al. 2001). Women also show greater cortical thickness than men do in many regions (Luders et al. 2006). Perhaps in compensation for the smaller brain, women also show greater gyrification in parts of frontal and parietal cortex and perhaps more efficient use of white matter (Gur et al. 1999). There are many reports of sex differences in the human brain, particularly in its function, and many of these are as yet unreplicated. Because males and females are routinely compared in studies, and positive results are more readily published than negative results, some findings of neural sex diferences may prove to be spurious",

Because males and females are routinely compared in studies, and positive results are more readily published than negative results, some findings of neural sex diferences may prove to be spurious. In addition, although many neural sex differences have been described, few have been linked to behavioral sex differences. In fact, many differences in brain function have been noted during equivalent performance by the sexes. For instance, men and women show diferent patterns of asymmetry of function when performing certain phonological tasks, despite showing no sex difference in task performance (Shaywitz et al. 1995). Similarly, for men and women matched for mathematical ability, mathematical performance correlates with teporal lobe activation in men but not in women (Haier & Benbow 1995), and for women, peformance on intelligence tests that do not differ by sex correlates with gray and white matter in frontal regions, whereas for men the correlation is with parietal regions (Haier et al. 2005). Ideed, neural sex differences may sometimes, or even commonly, exist to produce similar behaior in males and females, rather than to produce differences (De Vries & Sodersten 2009, MCarthy et al. 2009). Additionally, it appears that during performance of many tasks, male and female brains function similarly (Frost et al. 1999, Halari et al. 2005, Mansour et al. 1996). Despite the many neural sex similarities and the many neural sex differences that do not rlate to any behavioral sex difference, neural and behavioral sex differences have been linked in some instances. Much research in this area has focused on neural differences related to sexual orientation, particularly in men. The only fining in this area that has been independently replicated, at least as of yet, involves the third interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalmus (INAH-3)",

INAH-3 is thought to be the human homolog of the rodent SDN-POA, and four different research groups have reported that INAH-3, like the SDN-POA, is larger in males than in females (Allen et al. 1989, Byne et al. 2001, Garcia-Falgueras & Swaab, 2008, LeVay 1991). INAH-3 is also smaller (i.e., more female-typical) in homosexual than heerosexual men (Byne et al. 2001, LeVay 1991), although the number of neurons in the nucleus Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011.34:69-88. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org by Glasgow University on 07/14/13. For personal use only. appears similar for these two groups (Byne et al. 2001). The volumetric sex difference does not appear to relate to disease processes (e.g., HIV status) or to hormone use in adulthood (see Hines 2009 for discussion). Because the sex diference in SDN-POA volume in other mamals results from early testosterone exposure, differences in INAH-3 volume in humans may relate to the early hormone environment, as well. This possibility has not yet been directly investigated, however. Heterosexual and homosexual men also difer in corpus callosum anatomy; the isthmus, in particular, is significantly larger in righhanded homosexual compared with righhanded heterosexual men (Witelson et al. 2008). Patterns of cerebral asymmetry and functional cortical connectivity have also been linked to sexual orientation in both men and women (Savic & Lindstrom 2008). Researchers have also searched for neral correlates of gender identity disorder. One group has reported that the central subregion of the BNST (BNSTc) is smaller in women and in male-to-female transsexuals than in notranssexual men (Zhou et al. 1995). Interprtation of this finding is complicated, however, because the sex difference in BNSTc does not appear until after puberty (Chung et al",

Interprtation of this finding is complicated, however, because the sex difference in BNSTc does not appear until after puberty (Chung et al. 2002), whereas most transsexual individuals recall feeing strongly cross-gendered from early chilhood. Thus, the difference in BNSTc may be the result of experience (Hines, 2009) or of the adult hormone treatment associated with changing sex (Lawrence 2009). This same rsearch group also reported that INAH-3 is smaller and contains fewer neurons in malto-female transsexuals than in control males (Garcia-Falgueras & Swaab 2008). In the realm of cognitive and motor sex differences, the midsagittal area of posterior callosal regions, particularly the splenium, rlates negatively to language lateralization and positively to verbal fluency in women (Hines et al. 1992b). These findings suggest a corrspondence between female-typical brain struture and female-typical cognitive function, given that language lateralization is reduced in women compared to men (McGlone, 1980, Voyer, 1996), whereas verbal fluency is greater in women than in men (Hyde & Linn 1988, Kolb & Wishaw 1985, Spreen & Strauss 1991) and posterior callosal regions tend to be larger in women than in men as well (de LaCostUtamsing & Holloway 1982, Witelson 1985). Gron et al. (2000) have also described links between sex differences in brain function and navigational performance (Gron et al. 2000).

Women with CAH have been found to perform better than healthy women on a different virtual maze task (Mueller et al. 2008), but there is, as yet, no evidence regarding neral activation in women with and without CAH while performing navigational tasks. Effects of Experience on the Brain Sex differences in brain structure or even function are often interpreted to imply inborn differences between males and females. This leap is inappropriate, however. Behavioral differences must be accompanied by neural differences, so the observation of a neural sex difference on its own tells us little to nothing about how the difference developed. This is true not only for differences in brain function, but also, at least in some cases, for differences in brain structure. For instance, experience can change the mammalian brain throughout the life span, and even neurogenesis in some brain regions can continue in adulthood ( Juraska 1998, Maguire et al. 2006, Ming & Song 2005).

A more drect strategy for identifying links between early hormones and the brain could be to look at neural structure or function in individuals with early hormone abnormality or in individuals for whom the early hormone environment has been measured. Although very little information of this type is available, some neural differences have been described in individuals with CAH (Hines 2009). Most notably, both males and females with CAH show decreased amygdala volume (Merke et al. 2003), and females with CAH show increased amygdala activation to negative facial emotions and, in this respect, rsemble healthy males (Ernst et al. 2007). These findings fit well with expectations based on eperimental work in other species because the amygdala, or some of its subregions, is larger in males than in females, contains receptors for androgen, is influenced by early manipulations of testosterone, and is involved in behaviors that show sex differences, including rough-antumble play and aggression (Cooke et al. 2007, Hines et al. 1992a). Other Potential Critical Periods for Hormone Influences on Gender Development In addition to the difference in testosterone in male and female fetuses, males and females differ in gonadal hormone levels neonatally. Shortly after birth, testosterone surges in boys (Forest et al. 1974), and estrogen surges in girls (Bidlingmaier et al. 1974, 1987). The testoterone surge has been called “mini-puberty” and may play a role in development of the gonads and external genitalia in infant boys (Quigley 2002). Human brain development, particularly cortical development, continues rapidly for the first two years after birth and reacts to experience (de Graaf-Peters & Hadders-Algra 2005, Huttenlocher 2002). Thus, this early postnatal period could provide a time when gonadal hormones and experience interact to shape the brain and behavioral propensities. The early postnatal hormone surges, particularly the testosterone surge in boys, are a focus of current research activity",

Men with anorchia (missing testes) but with normal penile development, who apparently experence normal testosterone levels prenatally, but who lack testosterone after birth, resemble controls in terms of sexual orientation, core gender identity, and questionnaire measures of personality characteristics viewed as masculine or feminine (Poomthavorn et al. 2009). Other characteristics may be influenced by the posnatal hormone surge, however. For example, men who lack the postnatal testosterone surge because they have idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism show reduced spatial abilities, and this condition is not reversed by susequent testosterone replacement (Hier & Crowley 1982). In addition, females who do not experience the early postnatal surge of gonadal steroids because they have Turner syndrome show evidence of reduced performance on tasks at which males excel, as well as on tasks at which females excel, but not on sex-neutral tasks (Collaer et al. 2002). Evidence from healthy infants also suggests that the postnatal testoterone surge may play a role in gender development. Initial evidence suggests that testosterone during early infancy relates to infants’ visual preferences for social stimuli (Alexander et al. 2009a), to neural organization for language processing (Friederici et al. 2008), and to sex-related development of the visual system (Held et al. 1996). Although these initial reports are somewhat inconsistent and require replication, they provide intriguing glimpses through a potential new window on early gonadal hormone contributions to human gender development. Contemporary research is also focusing on possible hormonal influences on neurobehaioral sexual differentiation at puberty. The homonal changes of puberty produce dramatic changes in the human body, and experimental research in rodents suggests that they produce Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011.34:69-88",

Puberty is also a time of great change in human behavior, characterized by increased sexual interest and activity and the emergence of some types of behavioral problems, incluing higher rates of depression in females than in males (Halpern et al. 1993, Hyde et al. 2008). Evidence supports the existence of sex differences in the timing of some neural changes that accompany puberty, and these seem to parallel the earlier puberty experienced by girls compared with boys. Total cerebral volume peaks earlier in girls than in boys (at about age 10.5 years versus 14.5 years), and although both adolescent girls and adolescent boys show an inverted-U-shaped pattern of change in cortical and subcortical gray matter, the peak occurs one to two years earlier in girls than in boys (Lenroot et al. 2007). Studies have also proposed links to hormones at this time. One study found that among girls global gray matter volume related negatively to estradiol levels, but among boys the same variable related positively to testosterone levels (Peper et al. 2009). Similarly, neural sex differences in adolescent girls and boys have been found to relate to circulating testosterone levels (Neufang et al. 2009). These data are corelational, so investigators do not know if hormones, or other associated developmental processes, are the causal factors. Another study, however, suggests that testosterone may play a role in the growth of white matter in the adolescent brain. In this study, white matter increased at different rates in girls and boys, and testosterone levels and androgen receptor type interacted in relation to this sex diffeence",

The association between male-typical brain development and testosterone levels was significantly stronger in boys with the more efficient type of androgen receptor than in boys with the less efficient type (Perrin et al. 2008). Like the investigations of possible organizational influences of hormones during neonatal development, research on puberty as an additional time of brain organization in relation to gender-linked behavior is in its early stages, but it offers promise for understanding the dramatic behavioral changes that occur at this time of adolescent development. CONCLUDING REMARKS The prenatal hormone environment clearly contributes to the development of sex-related variation in human behavior and plays a role in the development of individual differences in behavior within each sex, as well as differences between the sexes. Thus, early hormone diferences appear to be part of the answer to questions such as why males and females difer behaviorally and neurally, as well as why some of us are more sex-typical than others. In other species, the early hormone environment exerts its enduring effects on behavior by alteing neural development. Similar neural changes are thought to underlie associations between the early hormone environment and human bhavior, but the specific neural changes involved are just beginning to be identified. Many sex differences have been described in the human brain, but only a subset of these has been related to behavioral sex differences and still fewer have been linked to the early hormone environment. Steroid-sensitive regions, including regions of the hypothalamus and the amygdala, are implcated, as are interhemispheric connections, but establishing firm links between early hormones, brain development, and behavior is a primary area for future research",

Although this review has focused on homonal influences on gender-related brain dvelopment and behavior, it has also discussed direct genetic influences that may contribute, in particular, to developmental disabilities, such as autistic spectrum conditions. In addition, the role of socialization, culture, and cognitive developmental processes in the development of behavioral differences between males and females has been noted. Although hormones contribute to behavioral sex differences, other factors contribute, as well. In addition, geder development is multidimensional, and dvelopmental processes involved in each dimesion are likely to differ somewhat. A good Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011.34:69-88.

For personal use only. example of the numerous types of factors that can influence human gender development comes from research on children’s play. Here, evidence clearly shows that prenatal testoterone exposure plays a role in sex differences and individual differences, promoting maltypical toy, playmate, and activity interests. Ater birth, the early surges of testosterone or etrogen may be important, too, but socialization factors also gain in importance, as parents and then peers and eventually teachers encourage children to engage in gender-typed play (Fagot 1978, Langlois & Downs 1980, Pasterski et al. 2005). The child also begins to develop the uderstanding that he or she is male or female, and this knowledge produces motivation to imitate the behavior of others of the same sex and to rspond to information that things, such as toys or activities, are for girls or for boys by chooing the things that they have been told are for their own sex (Bussey & Bandura 1999, Martin et al. 2002, Masters et al. 1979, Perry & Bussey 1979). These social and cognitive developmetal influences on children’s activities could egage the same neural circuitry as underlies the effects of the early hormone environment",

Thus, identifying the brain systems influenced by early androgen exposure could help elucidate systems involved in other types of influences on the same behavioral outcomes, as well. SUMMARY POINTS 1. Human gender development begins before birth and is influenced by levels of testoterone prenatally, and perhaps neonatally. Sex-typed play in childhood relates to levels of testosterone before birth, and evidence indicates that the prenatal hormone enviroment also contributes to variability in sexual orientation, gender identity, and some, but not all, personality traits that differ on average for males and females. 2. Other types of influences on neurobehavioral gender development include direct genetic effects of the sex chromosomes and postnatal socialization and cognitive understanding of gender. 3. Gender development is multidimensional, and the combinations of factors that influence the many different dimensions of gender appear to differ. Early hormonal influences appear to play a larger role, for example, in children’s toy preferences than they do in cognitive abilities that show sex differences, where social and cultural influences appear to be more important. FUTURE ISSUES 1. Which neural changes can be associated with the early hormone environment, either in individuals with disorders that cause hormone abnormality or in healthy individuals for whom measures of the early hormone environment are available? 2. Does the early hormone environment contribute to the development of psychological disorders that are more common in one sex or the other? 3. Will early infancy and puberty prove to be critical periods when hormones exert permanent influences on human gendered behavior, as has been shown for prenatal development? 4",

It’s not from a love of Greek and Latin that we belabor neuroanatomy! Most of the connections we have described are precise and specifi c. For example, for you to be able to read these words, there must be a very fi ne-grained neural mapping of the light falling on your retina—how else could you see the dot in this question mark? The information must be carried centrally and dispersed precisely to many parts of the brain for processing, coodinated with control of the motor neurons that closely regulate the six muscles of each eye as it scans the page",

    "chunk_text": ". In addition to anatomical precision, point-to-point communication in the sensory and motor systems requires mechanisms that restrict synatic communication to the cleft between the axon terminal and its target. It just wouldn’t do for glutamate released in the somatosensory cortex to activate neurons in the motor cortex! Furthermore, transmission must be brief enough to allow rapid responses to new sensory inputs. Thus, at these synapses, only minute quantities of neurotransmitter are released with each impulse, and these molecules are then quickly destroyed enzmatically or taken up by neighboring cells. The postsynaptic actions at transmitter-gated ion channels last only as long as the transmitter is in the cleft, a few milliseconds at most. Many axon terminals also possess presynaptic “autoreceptors” that detect the transmitter concentrations in the cleft and inhibit release if they get too high. These mechanisms ensure that this type of synaptic transmission is tightly constrained, in both space and time. The elaborate mechanisms that constrain point-to-point synaptic transmission are somewhat like those in telecommunications. Telephone systems make possible very specifi c connections between one place and another so that your mother in Tacoma can talk just to you in Providence, reminding you that her birthday was last week. The telephone lines or cellular transmissions act like precise synaptic connections. The infl ence of one neuron (your mother) is targeted to a small number of other neurons (in this case, only you). The embarrassing message is limited to your ears only. The infl uence of a neuron in one of the sensory or motor systems discussed so far usually extends to the few dozen or few hudred cells it synapses on—a conference call, to be sure, but still relatively specifi c. Now imagine your mother being interviewed on a television talk show broadcast on a satellite network",

The widespread satellite transmission may allow her to tell millions of people that you forgot her birthday, and the loudspeaker in each television set will announce the message to anyone within earshot. Likewise, certain neurons communicate with hundreds of thousands of other cells. These widespread systems tend to act reltively slowly, over seconds to minutes. Because of their broad, protracted actions, such systems in the brain can orchestrate entire behaviors, raning from falling asleep to falling in love. Indeed, many of the behavioral dysfunctions collectively known as mental disorders are believed to result specifi cally from imbalances of certain of these chemicals. In this chapter, we look at three components of the nervous system that operate in expanded space and time (Figure 15.1). One component is the secretory hypothalamus . By secreting chemicals directly into the bloostream, the secretory hypothalamus can infl uence functions throughout both the brain and the body. A second component, controlled neurally by the hypothalamus, is the autonomic nervous system (ANS) , introduced I NT R O D U C TIO N 523 CHAPTER 15 CHEMICAL CONTROL OF THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR in Chapter 7. Through extensive interconnections within the body, the ANS simultaneously controls the responses of many internal organs, blood vessels, and glands. The third component exists entirely within the central nervous system (CNS) and consists of several related cell groups that differ with respect to the neurotransmitter they use. All of these cell groups extend their spatial reach with highly divergent axonal projetions and prolong their actions by using metabotropic postsynaptic recetors. Members of this component of the nervous system are called the diffuse modulatory systems of the brain . The diffuse systems are believed to regulate, among other things, the level of arousal and mood",

It is connected by a stalk to the pituitary gland, which dangles below the base of the brain, just above the roof of your mouth (Figure 15.2). Although this tiny cluster of nuclei makes up less than 1% of the brain’s mass, the infl uence of the hypthalamus on body physiology is enormous. Let’s take a brief tour of the hypothalamus and then focus on some of the ways in which it exerts its powerful infl uence. An Overview of the Hypothalamus The hypothalamus and dorsal thalamus are adjacent to one another, but their functions are very different. As we saw in the previous seven chaters, the dorsal thalamus lies in the path of all the point-to-point patways whose destination is the neocortex",

    "chunk_text": ". As we saw in the previous seven chaters, the dorsal thalamus lies in the path of all the point-to-point patways whose destination is the neocortex. Accordingly, the destruction of a small part of the dorsal thalamus can produce a discrete sensory or motor defi cit, such as a little blind spot or a lack of feeling on a portion of skin. In contrast, the hypothalamus integrates somatic and visceral responses in accordance with the needs of the brain . A tiny lesion in the hypothalmus can produce dramatic and often fatal disruptions of widely dispersed bodily functions. Homeostasis. In mammals, the requirements for life include a narrow range of body temperatures and blood compositions. The hypothalamus regulates these levels in response to a changing external environment. This regulatory process is called homeostasis , the maintenance of the body’s internal environment within a narrow physiological range. Consider temperature regulation. Biochemical reactions in many cells of the body are fi ne-tuned to occur at about 37°C. A deviation of more than a few degrees in either direction can be catastrophic. Temperatursensitive cells in the hypothalamus detect changes in brain temperature and orchestrate the appropriate responses. For example, if you stroll naked through the snow, the hypothalamus issues commands that cause you to shiver (generating heat in the muscles), develop goose bumps (a futile attempt to fl uff up your nonexistent fur for better insulation—a refl exive remnant from our hairier ancestors), and turn blue (shunting blood away from cold surface tissues to keep the sensitive core of the body warmer). In contrast, when you go for a jog in the tropics, the hypothalmus activates heat-loss mechanisms that make you turn red (shunting blood to surface tissues where heat can radiate away) and sweat (cooling the skin by evaporation). Other examples of homeostasis are the tight regulation of blood voume, pressure, salinity, acidity, and blood oxygen and glucose concentrtions",

The means by which the hypothalamus achieves these different types of regulation are remarkably diverse. Structure and Connections of the Hypothalamus. Each side of the hypthalamus has three functional zones: lateral, medial, and periventricular (Figure 15.3). The lateral and medial zones have extensive connections with the brain stem and the telencephalon and regulate certain types of behavior, as we will see in Chapter 16. Here we are concerned only with the third zone, which actually receives much of its input from the other two.

Within this zone exists a complex mix of neurons with different functions. One group of cells constitutes the suprchiasmatic nucleus (SCN) , which lies just above the optic chiasm. These cells receive direct retinal innervation and function to synchronize circdian rhythms with the daily light–dark cycle (see Chapter 19). Other cells in the periventricular zone control the ANS and regulate the outfl ow of the sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation of the visceral organs. The cells in a third group, called neurosecretory neurons , extend axons down toward the stalk of the pituitary gland. These are the cells that now command our attention",

Pathways to the Pituitary We have said that the pituitary dangles below the base of the brain, which is true when the brain is lifted out of the head. In a living brain, however, the pituitary is gently held in a cradle of bone at the base of the skull. It requires this special protection because it is the “mouthpiece” from which much of the hypothalamus “speaks” to the body. The pituitary has two lobes, posterior and anterior. The hypothalamus controls the two lobes in different ways. Hypothalamic Control of the Posterior Pituitary. The largest of the hpothalamic neurosecretory cells, magnocellular neurosecretory cells , extend axons down the stalk of the pituitary and into the posterior lobe (Figure 15.4). In the late 1930s, Ernst and Berta Scharrer, working at the University of Frankfurt in Germany, proposed that these neurons release chemical substances directly into the capillaries of the posterior lobe. At the time, this was quite a radical idea. It was well established that chemical messengers called hormones were released by glands into the bloodstream, but no one had thought that a neuron could act like a gland or that a neurotransmitter could act like a hormone. The Scharrers were correct, however. The substances released into the blood by neurons are now called neurohormones . Lateral Medial Hypthalamus Perivetricular Third ventricle ▲ FIGURE 15.3 Zones of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus has three functional zones: laeral, medial, and periventricular.

Other periventricular cells control the autonomic nervous system. 526 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR The magnocellular neurosecretory cells release two neurohormones into the bloodstream, oxytocin and vasopressin. Both of these chemicals are peptides, each consisting of a chain of nine amino acids. Oxytocin has sometimes been called the “love hormone” because levels rise duing sexual or intimate behaviors and promote social bonding (discussed further in Chapter 17). In women, it also plays a critical role during the fi nal stages of childbirth by causing the uterus to contract and facilitaing the delivery of the newborn. It also stimulates the ejection of milk from the mammary glands. All lactating mothers know about the complex “letdown” refl ex that involves the oxytocin neurons of the hypothalamus. Oxytocin release may be stimulated by the somatic sensations generated by a suckling baby. But the sight or sound of a baby (even someone else’s) can also trigger the release of milk beyond the mother’s conscious control. In each case, information about a sensory stimulus—somatic, visual, or auditory—reaches the cerebral cortex via the usual route, the thalamus, and the cortex ultimately stimulates the hypothalamus to trigger oxytcin release. The cortex can also suppress hypothalamic functions, such as when anxiety inhibits the letdown of milk. Vasopressin , also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH) , regulates blood volume and salt concentration. When the body is deprived of water, the blood volume decreases and blood salt concentration increases. These changes are detected by pressure receptors in the cardiovascular system and salt concentration-sensitive cells in the hypothalamus, respectively.

Magnocellular neurosecretory cells secrete oxytocin and vasopressin directly into capillaries in the posterior lobe of the pituitary. 527 CHAPTER 15 CHEMICAL CONTROL OF THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR Vasopressin-containing neurons receive information about these changes and respond by releasing vasopressin, which acts directly on the kidneys and leads to water retention and reduced urine production. Under conditions of lowered blood volume and pressure, communcation between the brain and the kidneys actually occurs in both diretions (Figure 15.5). The kidneys secrete an enzyme into the blood called renin . Elevated renin sets off a sequence of biochemical reactions in the blood. Angiotensinogen , a large protein released from the liver, is coverted by renin to angiotensin I , which breaks down further to form aother small peptide hormone, angiotensin II . Angiotensin II has direct effects on the kidney and blood vessels, which help increase blood presure. But angiotensin II in the blood is also detected by the subfornical organ , a part of the telencephalon that lacks a blood-brain barrier. Cells in the subfornical organ project axons into the hypothalamus where they activate, among other things, the vasopressin-containing neurosecretory cells. In addition, the subfornical organ activates cells in the lateral area of the hypothalamus, somehow producing an overwhelming thirst that Angiotensin II Renin Liver Blood vessels, kidney Lowered blood pressure ADH Angiotensin I Angiotensinogen Subfornical organ Hypothalamus Pituitary Kidney ▲ FIGURE 15.5 Communication between the kidneys and the brain.

It may be diffi cult to accept, but it’s true: To a limited extent, our brain is controlled by our kidneys! This example also illustrates that the means by which the hypothalamus maintains homeostasis go beyond control of the visceral organs and can include bhavioral responses. In Chapter 16, we will explore in more detail how the hypothalamus incites behavior. Hypothalamic Control of the Anterior Pituitary. Unlike the posterior lobe, which really is a part of the brain, the anterior lobe of the pituitary is an actual gland. The cells of the anterior lobe synthesize and secrete a wide range of hormones that regulate secretions from other glands throughout the body (together constituting the endocrine system). The pituitary homones act on the gonads, the thyroid glands, the adrenal glands, and the mammary glands (Table 15.1). For this reason, the anterior pituitary was traditionally described as the body’s “master gland.” But what controls the anterior pituitary? The secretory hypothalamus. The hypothalamus itself is the true master gland of the endocrine system . The anterior lobe is under the control of neurons in the periventricular area called parvocellular neurosecretory cells . These hypothalamic neurons do not extend axons all the way into the anterior lobe; instead, they communicate with their targets via the bloodstream (Figure 15.6). These neurons secrete what are called hypophysiotropic hormones into a uniquely specialized capillary bed at the fl oor of the third ventricle. These tiny blood vessels run down the stalk of the pituitary and branch in the anterior lobe",

This network of blood vessels is called the hypthalamo-pituitary portal circulation . Hypophysiotropic hormones screted by hypothalamic neurons into the portal circulation travel dowstream until they bind to specifi c receptors on the surface of pituitary cells. Activation of these receptors causes the pituitary cells to either screte or stop secreting hormones into the general circulation. Regulation of the adrenal glands illustrates how this system works. Located just above the kidneys, the adrenal glands consist of two parts, a shell called the adrenal cortex and a center called the adrenal mdulla . The adrenal cortex produces the steroid hormone cortisol ; when it is released into the bloodstream, cortisol acts throughout the body to mobilize energy reserves and suppress the immune system, preparing us to carry on in the face of life’s various stresses. In fact, a good stimulus for cortisol release is stress, ranging from physiological stress, such as a loss of blood; to positive emotional stimulation, such as falling in love; to psychological stress, such as anxiety over an upcoming exam",

These neurons lie in the periventricular hypothalamus and release a peptide called corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) into the blood of the portal circulation. CRH travels the short distance to the antrior pituitary, where, within about 15 seconds, it stimulates the release of corticotropin , or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) . ACTH enters the general circulation and travels to the adrenal cortex where, within a few minutes, it stimulates cortisol release (Figure 15.7). Blood levels of cortisol are, to some extent, self-regulated. Cortisol is a steroid , a class of biochemicals related to cholesterol. Thus, cortsol is a lipophilic (“fat-loving”) molecule, which dissolves easily in lipid membranes and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. In the brain, cortisol interacts with specifi c receptors that lead to inhibition of CRH release, thus ensuring that circulating cortisol levels do not get too high. Physicians need to be mindful of this feedback regulation when they prscribe prednisone, a synthetic form of cortisol. Prednisone is a powerful medicine, frequently used to suppress infl ammation",

Abrupt discontinuation of prednisone treatment does not give the adrenal cortex enough time to ramp up cortisol production and can thus result in what is called adrenal insuffi ciency . Among the symptoms of adrenal isuffi ciency are severe abdominal pain and diarrhea, extremely low blood pressure, and changes in mood and personality. Adrenal insuffi ciency is also a feature of a rare disorder called Addison’s disease , named after Thomas Addison, the British physician who fi rst described the condition in 1849.

Kennedy required a daily regimen of hormone replacement therapy to compensate for the loss of cortisol, a fact that was concealed during his presidency to protect his youthful and vigorous image. The fl ip side of adrenal insuffi ciency is a condition called Cushing’s disease , caused by pituitary gland dysfunction that results in elevated levels of ACTH and, consequently, cortisol. The symptoms include rapid weight gain, immune suppression, sleeplessness, memory impairment, and irritability.

THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM Besides controlling the ingredients of the hormonal soup that fl ows in our veins, the periventricular zone of the hypothalamus also controls the autonomic nervous system (ANS) . The ANS is an extensive network of interconnected neurons that are widely distributed inside the body. From the Greek autonomia (roughly meaning “independence”), autnomic functions are usually carried out automatically, without conscious, voluntary control. They are also highly coordinated functions.

The many physiological responses associated with stress help protect the body and the brain from the dangers that triggered the stress in the fi rst place. But stress in chronic doses can have insidious harmful effects as well. Neuroscientists have only begun to understand the relationship between stress, the brain, and brain damage. Stress leads to the release of the steroid hormone cortisol from the adrenal cortex. Cortisol travels to the brain through the bloodstream and binds to receptors in the cytoplasm of many neurons. The activated receptors travel to the cell ncleus, where they stimulate gene transcription and ultimately protein synthesis. One consequence of cortisol’s action is that neurons admit more Ca 2 through voltage-gated ion channels. This may be due to a direct change in the chanels, or it may be indirectly caused by changes in the cell’s energy metabolism",

Whatever the mechanism, presumably in the short term cortisol makes the brain better able to cope with the stress—perhaps by helping it fi gure out a way to avoid it! But what about the effects of chronic, unavoidable stress? In Chapter 6, we learned that too much calcium can be a bad thing. If neurons become overloaded with calcium, they die (excitotoxicity). The question naturally arises: Can cortisol kill? Bruce McEwen and his colleagues at Rockefeller University, and Robert Sapolsky and his colleagues at Stanford University, have studied this question in the rat brain. They found that daily injections of corticosterone (rat cortisol) for several weeks caused dendrites to wither in many neurons with corticosterone receptors. A few weeks later, these cells started to die. A similar result was found when, instead of daily hormone injections, the rats were stressed every day. Sapolsky’s studies of baboons in Kenya further reveal the scourges of chronic stress. Baboons in the wild maitain a complex social hierarchy, and subordinate males steer clear of dominant males when they can. During one year when the baboon population boomed, local villagers caged many of the animals to prevent them from destroying their crops. Unable to escape the “top baboons” in the cages, many of the subordinate males subsequently died—not from wounds or malnutrition but apparently from severe and sutained stress-induced effects. They had gastric ulcers, colitis, enlarged adrenal glands, and extensive degeneration of nerons in their hippocampus. Subsequent studies suggest that it is the direct effect of cortisol that damages the hippocapus. These effects of cortisol and stress resemble the effects of aging on the brain. Indeed, research has clearly shown that chronic stress causes premature aging of the brain",

In humans, exposure to the horrors of combat, sexual abuse, and other types of extreme violence can lead to postraumatic stress disorder, with symptoms of heightened anxety, memory disturbances, and intrusive thoughts. Imaging studies have consistently found degenerative changes in the brains of victims, particularly in the hippocampus. In Chapter 22, we will see that stress, and the brain’s response to it, play a central role in several psychiatric disorders. 532 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR impossible-looking equation. You are faced with a classic fi ght-or-fl ight situation, and your body reacts accordingly, even as your conscious mind frantically considers whether to blunder through it or beg off in humilation. Your ANS triggers a host of physiological responses, including increased heart rate and blood pressure, depressed digestive functions, and mobilized glucose reserves. These responses are all produced by the sympathetic division of the ANS. Now imagine your relief as the clasending bell suddenly rings, saving you from acute embarrassment and the instructor’s anger. You settle back into your chair, breathe deeply, and read the clue for 24 down. Within a few minutes, your sympathetic responses decrease to low levels, and the functions of your parasypathetic division crank up again: Your heart rate slows and blood pressure drops, digestive functions work harder on breakfast, and you stop sweating. Notice that you may not have moved out of your chair throughout this unpleasant event. Maybe you didn’t even move your pencil. But your body’s internal workings reacted dramatically. Unlike the somatic motor system , whose alpha motor neurons can rapidly excite skeletal muscles with pinpoint accuracy, the actions of the ANS are typically multiple, widespread, and relatively slow. Therefore, the ANS operates in expanded space and time",

In addition, unlike the somatic motor system, which can only excite its peripheral targets, the ANS balances synaptic excitation and inhibition to achieve widely coordinated and graded control. ANS Circuits Together, the somatic motor system and the ANS constitute the total neural output of the CNS. The somatic motor system has a single funtion: It innervates and commands skeletal muscle fi bers. The ANS has the complex task of commanding every other tissue and organ in the body that is innervated. Both systems have upper motor neurons in the brain that send commands to lower motor neurons, which actually innervate the target structures outside the nervous system. However, they have some interesting differences (Figure 15.8).

Postganglionic neurons are driven by preganglionic neurons , whose cell bodies are in the spinal cord and brain stem. Thus, the somatic motor system controls its targets (skeletal muscles) via a monosynaptic pathway , while the ANS infl uences its targets (smooth muscles, cardiac muscle, and glands) using a disynaptic pathway. Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Divisions. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions operate in parallel, but they use pathways that are quite distinct in structure and in their neurotransmitter sytems. Preganglionic axons of the sympathetic division emerge only from the middle third of the spinal cord (thoracic and lumbar segments). In contrast, preganglionic axons of the parasympathetic division emerge only from the brain stem and the lowest (sacral) segments of the spnal cord, so the two systems complement each other anatomically (Figure 15.9). The preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic division lie within the intermediolateral gray matter of the spinal cord. They send their axons through the ventral roots to synapse on neurons in the ganglia of the sympathetic chain , which lies next to the spinal column, or within collateral ganglia found within the abdominal cavity. The preganglionic parasympathetic neurons, on the other hand, sit within a variety of brain stem nuclei and the lower (sacral) spinal cord, and their axons travel within several cranial nerves as well as the nerves of the sacral spnal cord. The parasympathetic preganglionic axons travel much farther than the sympathetic axons because the parasympathetic ganglia are typically located next to, on, or in their target organs (see Figures 15.8 and 15.9). The ANS innervates three types of tissue: glands, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle. Thus, almost every part of the body is a target of the ANS, as shown in Figure 15.9.

The pacmaker region of the heart triggers each heartbeat without the help of neurons, but both divisions of the ANS innervate it and modulate it; sympathetic activity results in an increase in the rate of beating, while parasympathetic activity slows it down. The smooth muscles of the gatrointestinal tract are also dually innervated, but the effect of each dvision is the opposite of its effect on the heart. Intestinal motility, and thus digestion, is stimulated by parasympathetic axons and inhibited by sympathetic axons. Not all tissues receive innervation from both divsions of the ANS, however. For example, blood vessels of the skin, and the sweat glands, are innervated (and excited) only by sympathetic axons. Lacrimal ( tear-producing) glands are innervated (and excited) only by parasympathetic input. Another example of the balance of parasympathetic–sympathetic activity is the curious neural control of the male sexual response. Erection of the human penis is a hydraulic process. It occurs when the penis becomes engorged with blood, which is triggered and sustained by parasympathetic activity. The curious part is that orgasm and ejaulation are triggered by sympathetic activity. You can imagine how complicated it must be for the nervous system to orchestrate the entire sexual act; parasympathetic activity gets it going (and keeps it going), but a shift to sympathetic activity is necessary to bring it to a sucessful conclusion. Anxiety and worry, and their attendant sympathetic activity, tend to inhibit erection and promote ejaculation.

Notice that the preganglionic inputs of both divisions use ACh as a neurotransmitter. The postganglionic parasympthetic innervation of the visceral organs also uses ACh, but the postganglionic sympathetic innervation uses NE (with the exception of innervation of the sweat glands and vascular smooth muscle within skeletal muscle, which use ACh). The adrenal medulla receives preganglionic sympathetic innervation and secretes epnephrine into the bloodstream when activated. Note the pattern of innervation by the sympathetic division: Target organs in the chest cavity are innervated by posganglionic neurons originating in the sympathetic chain, and target organs in the abdominal cavity are innervated by postganglionic neurons originating in the collateral ganglia. 536 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR gallbladder. It consists of two complicated networks, each with sensory nerves, interneurons, and autonomic motor neurons, called the myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus and submucous (Meissner’s) plexus (Figure 15.10).

The eteric system is not small; it contains about 500 million neurons, the same number of neurons as the entire spinal cord!

This information is used by enteric interneuronal circuits and motor neurons, which also reside in the gut, to govern smooth muscle motility, the production of mucous and digestive secretions, and the diameter of the local blood vessels. For example, consider a partially digested pizza making its way through the small intestine. The enteric nervous system ensures that lubricating mucus and digestive enzymes are delivered, that rhythmic (peristaltic) muscle action works to mix the pizza and enzymes thoroughly, and that intestinal blood fl ow increases to provide a suffi cient fl uid source and transport newly acquired nutrients to the rest of the body. The enteric division is not entirely autonomous. It receives input indrectly from the “real” brain via axons of the sympathetic and parasympthetic divisions.

Somehow this diminutive structure integrates the diverse information it receives about the body’s status, anticipates some of its needs, and provides a coordnated set of both neural and hormonal outputs. Essential to autonomic control are the connections of the periventricular zone to the brain stem and spinal cord nuclei that contain the preganglionic neurons of the sypathetic and parasympathetic divisions. The nucleus of the solitary tract , located in the medulla and connected with the hypothalamus, is another important center for autonomic control. In fact, some autonomic functions operate well even when the brain stem is disconnected from all structures above it, including the hypothalamus. The solitary nucleus integrates sensory information from the internal organs and coordinates output to the autonomic brain stem nuclei. Neurotransmitters and the Pharmacology of Autonomic Function Even people who have never heard the word neurotransmitter know what it means to “get your adrenaline fl owing.” (In the United Kingdom, this compound is called adrenaline , while in the United States, it is called epinephrine .) Historically, the autonomic nervous system has probably taught us more than any other part of the body about how nerotransmitters work. Because the ANS is relatively simple compared to the CNS, we understand the ANS much better. In addition, neurons of the peripheral parts of the ANS are outside the blood-brain barrier, so all drugs that enter the bloodstream have direct access to them. The relative simplicity and accessibility of the ANS have led to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of drugs that infl uence synaptic transmission. Preganglionic Neurotransmitters.

The primary transmitter of the pripheral autonomic neurons is acetylcholine (ACh) , the same transmitter used at skeletal neuromuscular junctions. The preganglionic neurons of both sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions release ACh . The immdiate effect is that the ACh binds to nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChR), which are ACh-gated channels, and evokes a fast excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) that usually triggers an action potential in the posganglionic cell. This is very similar to the mechanisms of the skeletal neuromuscular junction, and drugs that block nAChRs in muscle, such as curare, also block autonomic output. Ganglionic ACh does more than neuromuscular ACh, however. It also activates muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChR), which are metabotropic (G-protein-coupled) receptors that can cause both the opening and the closing of ion channels that lead to very slow EPSPs and IPSPs. These slow mAChR events are usually not evident unless the preganglionic nerve is activated repetitively. In addition to ACh, some preganglionic terminals release a variety of small, neuroactive peptides such as neurpeptide Y (NPY) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). These also interact with G-protein-coupled receptors and can trigger small EPSPs that last for several minutes. The effects of peptides are modulatory; they do not usually bring the postsynaptic neurons to fi ring threshold, 538 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR but they make them more responsive to the fast nicotinic effects when they do come along. Since more than one action potential is required to stimulate the release of these modulatory neurotransmitters, the pattern of fi ring in preganglionic neurons is an important variable in determining the type of postganglionic activity that is evoked.

Postganglionic cells—the autonomic motor neurons that actually trigger glands to secrete, sphincters to cotract or relax, and so on—use different neurotransmitters in the sypathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the ANS. Postganglionic parasympathetic neurons release ACh, but those of most parts of the sympathetic division use norepinephrine (NE) . Parasympathetic ACh has a very local effect on its targets and acts entirely through mAChRs. In contrast, sympathetic NE often spreads far, even into the blood where it can circulate widely. The autonomic effects of a variety of drugs that interact with chlinergic and noradrenergic systems can be confi dently predicted once you understand some of the autonomic circuitry and chemistry (see Figure 15.9). In general, drugs that promote the actions of norepineprine or inhibit the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine are sympathommetic ; they cause effects that mimic activation of the sympathetic dvision of the ANS. For example, atropine , an antagonist of mAChRs, produces signs of sympathetic activation, such as dilation of the pupils. This response occurs because the balance of ANS activity is shifted toward the sympathetic division when parasympathetic actions are blocked. On the other hand, drugs that promote the muscarinic actions of ACh or inhibit the actions of NE are parasympathomimetic ; they cause effects that mimic activation of the parasympathetic division of the ANS. For example, propranolol , an antagonist of the receptor for NE, slows the heart rate and lowers blood pressure. For this reason, prpranolol is sometimes used to prevent the physiological consequences of stage fright. But what about the familiar fl ow of adrenaline?

THE DIFFUSE MODULATORY SYSTEMS OF THE BRAIN Consider what happens when you fall asleep. The internal commands “You are becoming drowsy” and “You are falling asleep” are messages that must be received by broad regions of the brain. Dispensing this infomation requires neurons with a particularly widespread pattern of axons. The brain has several such collections of neurons, each using a particular neurotransmitter and making widely dispersed, diffuse, almost meadering connections. Rather than carrying detailed sensory information, these cells often perform regulatory functions, modulating vast asseblies of postsynaptic neurons (in structures such as the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and the spinal cord) so that they become more or less excitable, more or less synchronously active, and so on.

Anatomy and Functions of the Diffuse Modulatory Systems The diffuse modulatory systems differ in structure and function, yet they have certain principles in common: • Typically, the core of each system has a small set of neurons (several thousand). • Neurons of the diffuse systems arise from the central core of the brain, most of them from the brain stem. • Each neuron can infl uence many others because each one has an axon that may contact more than 100,000 postsynaptic neurons spread widely across the brain. • The synapses made by many of these systems release transmitter moecules into the extracellular fl uid, so they can diffuse to many neurons rather than be confi ned to the vicinity of the synaptic cleft. We’ll focus on the modulatory systems of the brain that use either norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), or acetylcholine (ACh) as a neurotransmitter. Recall from Chapter 6 that all of these tranmitters activate specifi c metabotropic (G-protein-coupled) receptors, and these receptors mediate most of their effects; for example, the brain has 10–100 times more metabotropic ACh receptors than ionotropic nicotinic ACh receptors. Because neuroscientists are still working hard to determine the exact functions of these systems in behavior, our explanations here will necesarily be general. It is clear, however, that the functions of the diffuse modulatory systems depend on how electrically active they are, individally and in combination, and on how much neurotransmitter is available for release (Box 15.2). The Noradrenergic Locus Coeruleus. Besides being a neurotransmiter in the peripheral ANS, NE is also used by neurons of the tiny locus coeruleus in the pons (from the Latin for “blue spot” because of the piment in its cells). Each human locus coeruleus has about 12,000 neurons. We have two of them, one on each side",

A major breakthrough occurred in the mid-1960s, when Nils-Åke Hillarp and Bengt Falck at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden deveoped a technique that enabled the catecholaminergic (noradrenergic and dopaminergic) neurons to be visualized selectively in histological sections prepared from the brain (Figure 15.11). This analysis revealed that axons leave the locus coeruleus in several tracts but then fan out to innervate just about every part of the brain: all of the cerebral cortex, the thalamus and the hypothalamus, the olfactory bulb, the cerebellum, the midbrain, and the spinal cord (Figure 15.12). The locus coeruleus makes some of the most diffuse connections in the brain, considering that just one of its neurons can make more than 250,000 synapses, and it can have one axon branch in the cerebral cortex and another in the cerebellar cortex! The organization of this circuitry is so different from what was then known about synaptic connections in the brain that it took many years 540 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR O F S P E C I A L I N T E R E S T BOX 15.2 You Eat What You Are A mericans, it seems, are always trying to lose weight. The low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets (think bagels) that were all the rage in the 1990s were replaced by a low-carb craze (think omelets). Changing your diet can alter caloric intake and the body’s metabolism, and it can also alter how your brain functions. The infl uence of diet on the brain is most clear in the case of the diffuse modulatory systems. Consider serotonin. Serotonin is synthesized in two steps from the dietary amino acid tryptophan (see Figure 6.14). In the fi rst step, a hydroxyl group (OH) is added to tryptophan by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase. The low affi nity of the enzyme for tryptophan makes this step rate-limiting for serotonin synthesis—that is, serotonin can be produced only as fast as this enzyme can hydroxylate tryptophan",

The low affi nity of the enzyme for tryptophan makes this step rate-limiting for serotonin synthesis—that is, serotonin can be produced only as fast as this enzyme can hydroxylate tryptophan. And a lot of tryptophan is required to push the synthetic reaction as fast as it can go. However, brain tryptophan levels are well below the level required to saturate the enzyme. Thus, the rate of serotonin synthesis is determined, in part, by the availability of tryptophan in the brain—more tryptophan, more serotonin; less tryptophan, less serotonin. Brain tryptophan levels are controlled by how much trytophan is in the blood and by how effi ciently it is transported across the blood-brain barrier. Tryptophan in the blood is drived from the proteins we digest in our diet, so a high-protein diet will lead to sharply increased blood levels of tryptophan. Surprisingly, however, there is a decline in brain tryptophan (and serotonin) for several hours after a hearty, high-protein meal. The paradox was resolved by Richard Wurtman and his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who observed that several other amino acids (tyrosine, phnylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, and valine) compete with trytophan for transport across the blood-brain barrier. These other amino acids are rich in a high-protein diet, and they suppress the entry of the tryptophan into the brain. The sitation is reversed with a high-carbohydrate meal that also contains some protein. Insulin, released by the pancreas in response to carbohydrates, decreases the blood levels of the competing amino acids relative to tryptophan. So the tryptphan in the blood is effi ciently transported into the brain, and serotonin levels rise. Increased brain tryptophan correlates with elevated mood, decreased anxiety, and increased sleepiness, likely due to changes in serotonin levels",

Inadequate tryptophan may eplain the phenomenon of carbohydrate craving that has been reported in humans with seasonal affective disorder—the depression of mood brought on by reduced daylight during winter. It may also explain why clinical trials for treating obsity with extreme carbohydrate deprivation had to be stopped because of complaints of mood disturbances (depression, irritability) and insomnia. Based on these and other observations, Wurtman and his wife Judith made the intriguing suggestion that our dietary choices may refl ect our brain’s need for serotonin. Consistent with this notion, drugs that elevate extracellular serotonin can be effective for weight loss (as well as depression), possbly by reducing the body’s demand for carbohydrates. We will discuss the involvement of serotonin in appetite regultion further in Chapter 16, and in the regulation of mood in Chapter 22. ▲ FIGURE 15.11 Norepinephrine-containing neurons of the locus coeruleus.

Locus coeruleus cells seem to be involved in the regulation of attention, arousal, and sleep–wake cycles as well as learning and memory, anxiety and pain, mood, and brain metabolism. This makes it sound as if the locus coeruleus may run the whole show. But the key word is “involved,” which can mean almost anything. For example, our heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys are also involved in every brain function, for without them, the brain cannot survive.

    "chunk_text": ". Because of its widespread connections, the locus coeruleus can infl uence virtually all parts of the brain. But to understand its actual functions, we start by determining what activates its neurons. Recordings from awake, behaving rats and monkeys show that locus coruleus neurons are most strongly activated by new, unexpected, nonpaiful sensory stimuli in the animal’s environment. They are least active when the animals are not vigilant, just sitting around quietly, digesting a meal. The locus coeruleus may participate in a general arousal of the brain during interesting events in the outside world. Because NE can make neurons of the cerebral cortex more responsive to salient sensory stimuli, the locus coeruleus may function generally to increase brain rsponsiveness, speeding information processing by the point-to-point sesory and motor systems and making them more effi cient. The Serotonergic Raphe Nuclei. Serotonin-containing neurons are mostly clustered within the nine raphe nuclei . Raphe means “ridge” or “seam” in Greek, and, indeed, the raphe nuclei lie to either side of the midline of the brain stem. Each nucleus projects to different regions of the CNS (Figure 15.13). Those more caudal, in the medulla, innervate the spinal cord, where they modulate pain-related sensory signals (see Chapter 12). Those more rostral, in the pons and midbrain, innervate most of the brain in much the same diffuse way as do the locus coeruleus neurons. Similar to neurons of the locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei cells fi re most rapidly during wakefulness, when an animal is aroused and active.

By the late 1950s, central chemical neurotranmission was conceived as an extension to the brain of the then best studied synapse, the neuromuscular junction. Here acetylcholine had satisfi ed the four identifi cation criteria of a neurotransmitter: localization, mimicry of nerve action, identcal pharmacology, and ionic permeability changes. But what other brain chemicals did the brain use for those synapses not mediated by acetylcholine? NE was detected in the brain and was regionally distributed (rich in hypothalamus, low in cortex), which was incompatible with it being simply the sypathetic innervation of the brain’s blood vessels, but what did it do? When I went to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1962 to avoid the “Doctor’s Draft” into the Army, I spent 2 years assessing how neurons in the hypothalamus, olfatory bulb, and striatum respond to NE applied by microionphoresis. The results appeared random: A third fi red faster, a third fi red slower, and the remaining third were unresponsive. What was missing was knowledge of which neurons, if any, were actually innervated by NE fi bers. This critical information was provided when the Swedish scientists Nils-Åke Hillarp and Bengt Falck developed a histochemical method, called formaldehyde-induced fl uorescence , which caused monamines (NE, dopamine, and serotonin) to fl uoresce when iluminated with the appropriate wavelength of light.

I therefore went to Yale to try different approaches using electron microscopy and autoradiography to see which nerve terminals could concentrate radioactive NE, as Julius Axelrod had done for the sympathetic innervation of the pneal body. When I returned to NIH in 1968, I had learned enough to suspect that cerebellar Purkinje neurons were targets of synapses utilizing NE as a neurotransmitter. This was also the best understood region of the brain in terms of cellular cicuitry. Together with Barry Hoffer, who had studied cerebellar development, and George Siggins, who was expert in the sympathetic innervation of peripheral blood vessels, we set about to test how Purkinje neurons respond to NE. We found that they responded consistently by slowing their spontanous activity. This effect was blocked by norepinephrine beta receptor antagonists and was prolonged by NE reuptake inhibitors, and both effects were lost when the NE neurons were destroyed with the toxin 6-hydroxydopamine. While visiting the Karolinska Institute in 1971 (the year Axelrod was awarded the Nobel Prize), I learned from Lars P A T H O F D I S C O V E R Y BOX 15.3 neurons are the most quiet during sleep. The locus coeruleus and the raphe nuclei are part of a venerable concept called the ascending reticular activating system , which implicates the reticular “core” of the brain stem in processes that arouse and awaken the forebrain. This simple idea has been refi ned and redefi ned in countless ways since it was introduced in the 1950s, but its basic sense remains. Raphe neurons seem to be intmately involved in the control of sleep–wake cycles, as well as the diffeent stages of sleep. It is important to note that several other transmitter systems are involved in a coordinated way as well. We will discuss the involvement of the diffuse modulatory systems in sleep and wakefulness in Chapter 19",

When Siggins, Hoffer, and I electrically stimulated the locus coeruleus, Purkinje cell fi ring slowed, thus mimicking the effects of NE by microionophresis. The effect of locus coeruleus stimulation was lost when NE was depleted using inhibitors of tyrosine hydroxylase, or eradicated with 6-hydroxydopamine. At last, we were covinced that NE satisfi ed the neurotransmitter identifi cation crteria. But clearly, the CNS actions of NE differed dramatically from those of “classical” fast central transmitter systems. Instead of being strictly excitatory or inhibitory, NE seemed to act to enhance the effects of other afferent projections to the same postsynaptic targets. Menahem Segal, working with me at the NIH, reached a similar conclusion for the actions of NE in the hippocampus. After moving to the Salk Institute, I worked with Steve Foote and Gary Aston-Jones to record the fi ring patterns of the locus coeruleus neurons in awake behaving rats and squirrel monkeys. These experiments revealed that the locus coeruleus neurons have brief phasic responses to novel sesory signals of all modalities, progressively slowing with loss of attention and becoming silent during rapid eye movement sleep",

In contrast to the diffuse rodent cortical innervations, their data showed differences in the amount of innervation in architectonically defi ned areas of the cerebral cortex, particularly in the cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex. This map suggested that the locus coeruleus-NE afferents have a greater infl uence on spatial and visuomotor detection than on detailed sensory feature detection.

Acetylchline is the familiar transmitter at the neuromuscular junction, at synapses in autonomic ganglia, and at postganglionic parasympathetic synapses. Cholinergic interneurons also exist within the brain—in the striatum and the cortex, for example. In addition, there are two major diffuse modultory cholinergic systems in the brain, one of which is called the basal forebrain complex . It is a “complex” because the cholinergic neurons lie scattered among several related nuclei at the core of the telencephalon, medial and ventral to the basal ganglia. The best known of these are the medial septal nuclei , which provide the cholinergic innervation of the hipocampus, and the basal nucleus of Meynert , which provides most of the cholinergic innervation of the neocortex. The function of the cells in the basal forebrain complex remains mostly unknown. But interest in this region has been fueled by the discovery that these are among the fi rst cells to die during the course of Alzheimer’s diease, which is characterized by a progressive and profound loss of cognitive functions. (However, there is widespread neuronal death in Alzheimer’s disease, and no specifi c link between the disease and cholinergic neurons has been established.) Like the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems, the cholinergic system has been implicated in regulating general brain ecitability during arousal and sleep–wake cycles.

Later the drug was discovered by intellectals, artists, students, and the U.S. Defense Department, who investigated its “mind-expanding” effects. (A chief advocate of LSD use was former Harvard psychologist Timothy Leary.) In the 1960s, LSD made its way to the street and was widely abused. It is illegal to possess LSD today. LSD is extremely potent. A dose of only 25 g is suffi cient to produce a full-blown hallucinogenic effect (compared to a normal dose of aspirin at 650 mg, which is 25,000 times larger). Among the reported behavioral efects of LSD are a dreamlike state with heightened awareness of sensory stimuli, often with a mixing of perceptions such that sounds can evoke images, images can evoke smells, and so on. The chemical structure of LSD (and the active ingredients of Psilocybe mushrooms and peyote) is very close to that of serotonin, suggesting that it acts on the serotonergic system. Indeed, LSD is a potent agonist at the serotonin receptors on the presynaptic terminals of neurons in the raphe nuclei. Activation of these receptors markedly inhibits the fi ring of raphe neurons. Thus, one known CNS effect of LSD is a reduction in the outfl ow of the brain’s serotonergic diffuse modulatory system. It is interesting to note in this regard that decreased activity of the raphe nuclei is also characteristic of dream-sleep (see Chapter 19). Can we conclude that LSD produces hallucinations by silencing the brain’s serotonin systems? If only drug effects on the brain were that simple. Unfortunately, there are problems with this hypothesis. For one, silencing neurons in the raphe nuclei by other means—by destroying them, for example—does not mimic the effects of LSD in experimental animals",

Furthermore, animals still respond as expected to LSD after their raphe nuclei have been destroyed. In recent years, researchers have focused on direct LSD actions at serotonin receptors in the cerebral cortex. Current research suggests that LSD causes hallucinations by superseding the naturally modulated release of serotonin in cortical areas where perceptions normally are formed and interpreted. Stimulants. In contrast to the uncertainties about hallucinogens and serotonin, it is clear that the powerful CNS stimulants cocaine and amphetamine both exert their effects at synapses made by dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems. Both drugs give users a feeling of increased alertness and self-confi dence, a sense of exhilaration and euphoria, and a 547 CHAPTER 15 CHEMICAL CONTROL OF THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR decreased appetite. Both are also sympathomimetic—they cause periperal effects that mimic activation of the sympathetic division of the ANS: increased heart rate and blood pressure, dilation of the pupils, and so on. Cocaine is extracted from the leaves of the coca plant and has been used by Andean indigenous peoples for hundreds of years. In the minineteenth century, cocaine turned up in Europe and North America as the magic ingredient in a wide range of concoctions touted as having medicinal value. (An example is Coca-Cola, originally marketed in 1886 as a therapeutic agent, which contained both cocaine and caffeine.) Cocaine use fell out of favor early in the twentieth century, only to reemerge in the late 1960s as a popular recreational drug. Ironically, one of the main reasons for the rise in cocaine use during this period was the tightening of regulations against amphetamines. First chemically synthesized in 1887, amphetamines did not come into wide use until World War II, when they were taken by soldiers (particularly aviators) to sustain them in combat",

First chemically synthesized in 1887, amphetamines did not come into wide use until World War II, when they were taken by soldiers (particularly aviators) to sustain them in combat. Following the war, amphetamines became available as nonprescription diet aids, as nasal decongestants, and as “pep pills.” Regulations were fi nally tightened after recognition that amphetamines are, like cocaine, highly addictive and dangerous in large doses. The neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine are catechoamines , named for their chemical structure (see Chapter 6). The actions of catecholamines released into the synaptic cleft are normally terminated by specifi c uptake mechanisms. Cocaine and amphetamine both block this catecholamine uptake (Figure 15.16). However, recent work suggests that cocaine targets DA reuptake more selectively; amphetamine blocks NE and DA reuptake and stimulates the release of DA. Thus, these drugs can prolong and intensify the effects of released DA or NE. Is this the means by which cocaine and amphetamine cause their stimulant effects? There is good reason for thinking so. For example, experimental depletion of brain catecholamines by using synthesis inhibitors (such as - methyltyrosine) will abolish the stimulant effects of both cocaine and amphetamine. Besides having a similar stimulant effect, cocaine and amphetamine share another, more insidious behavioral action: psychological dependence, or addiction. Users will develop powerful cravings for prolonging and cotinuing drug-induced pleasurable feelings.

Dopa (3, 4-dihydroxypheynylalanine) is an intermediate in the synthesis of both. The actions of NE and DA are usually terminated by uptake back into the axon terminal. Ampheamine and cocaine block this uptake, thereby allowing NE and DA to remain in the synaptic cleft longer. 548 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR result specifi cally from the enhanced transmission in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system during drug use. Remember, this system may normally function to reinforce adaptive behaviors. By short-circuiting the system, these drugs instead reinforce drug-seeking behavior. Indeed, just as rats will work to electrically stimulate the mesocorticolimbic projection, they will also work to receive an injection of cocaine. We’ll discuss the involvement of dopamine pathways in motivation and addiction further in Chapter 16. CONCLUDING REMARKS In this chapter, we have examined three components of the nervous sytem that are characterized by the great reach of their infl uences. The secretory hypothalamus and autonomic nervous system communicate with cells all over the body, and the diffuse modulatory systems commnicate with neurons in many different parts of the brain. They are also characterized by the duration of their direct effects, which can range from minutes to hours. Finally, they are characterized by their chemical nerotransmitters. In many instances, the transmitter defi nes the system. For example, in the peripheral nervous system, we can use the words “noradrenergic” and “sympathetic” interchangeably. The same thing goes for “raphe” and “serotonin” in the forebrain, and “substantia nigra” and “dopamine” in the basal ganglia. These chemical idiosyncrasies have allowed interpretations of drug effects on behavior that are not possible with most other neural systems",

Thus, we have a good idea where in the brain amphetamine and cocaine exert their stimulant effects, and where outside the CNS, they act to raise blood pressure and heart rate. At a detailed level, each of the systems discussed in this chapter peforms different functions. But at a general level, they all maintain brain homeostasis : They regulate different processes within a certain physological range. For example, the ANS regulates blood pressure within a range that is appropriate. Blood pressure variations optimize an anmal’s performance under different conditions. In a similar way, the noadrenergic locus coeruleus and serotonergic raphe nuclei regulate levels of consciousness and mood. These levels also vary within a range that is adaptive to the organism. In the next several chapters, we will encounter these systems again in the context of specifi c functions.

Saunders, DPhil, MRCPsych; Guy M. Goodwin, FMedSci IMPORTANCE Existing therapeutic options are insufficient to tackle the disease burden of depression, and new treatments are sorely needed. Defining new psychotherapeutic targets is challenging given the paucity of coherent mechanistic explanations for depression. OBJECTIVE To assess whether mood homeostasis (ie, the stabilization of one’s mood by engaging in mood-modifying activities) is a possible new therapeutic target by testing the hypothesis that people with low (vs high) mean mood and people with (vs without) a history of depression have impaired mood homeostasis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The quantitative association between mood and daily activities was computed in 2 large case-control studies based on the 58sec data set (collected from December 1, 2012, to May 31, 2014, and analyzed from April 1 to 30, 2019), and the World Health Organization Study on Global Aging and Adult Health (WHO SAGE) data set (collected from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2010, and analyzed from June 1 to 30, 2019). The 58sec data set consists of self-enrolled participants from high-income countries. The WHO SAGE data set consists of nationally representative participants in loand middle-income countries recruited via cluster sampling. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome (defined before data analysis) was the difference in mood homeostasis between people with high vs low mean mood (58sec data) and between people with vs without a history of depression (WHO SAGE data). RESULTS A total of 28 212 participants from the 58sec data set (65.8% female; mean [SD] age, 28.1 [9.0] years) and 30 116 from the WHO SAGE data set (57.0% female; mean [SD] age, 57.8 [14.7] years) were included, for an overall study population of 58 328 participants",

This idea was inspired by recent large-scale studies showing a robust pattern of associations between mood and choices of activities in the general population, 7-9 termed the hedonic flexibility principle . According to this principle, people have a higher propensity to engage in mood-increasing activties when their mood is low and to sustain useful but moodecreasing activities when their mood is high. We hypotesizedthatthisprinciplereflectsahomeostaticmechanismthat helps stabilize mood in healthy people. Conversely, if weak or absent, the mechanism could increase the risk of a spiral down to depression. We first tested this hypothesis by assessing the assocition between mood homeostasis and individuals’ mean mood among 28 212 people whose moods and activities were tracked in real time. We then sought to confirm the hypothesis by coparing mood homeostasis between people with and without a history of depression in an independent data set of 30 116 people across 6 countries obtained from the World Health Organization Study on Global Aging and Adult Health (WHO SAGE). 10 Methods Participants and Data We used 2 independent and complementary case-control data sets.

This simulation is further described in eMethods 9 in the Supplement . Results A total of 28 212 participants from the 58sec data set (18 504 [65.8%] female and 9621 [34.2%] male, among those who reported sex; mean [SD] age, 28.1 [9.0] years) and 30 116 from the WHO SAGE data set (17 175 [57.0%] female and 12 939 [43.0%] male, among those who reported sex; mean [SD] age, 57.8 [14.7] years) were included in the analysis, for a total study population of 58 328 participants. Mood homeostasis as a function of an individual’s mean mood in the 58sec data set is shown in Figure 1 . For individuals’ mean moods below the population mean (μ = 61), mood homeostasis decreased monotonically. Its value fell to a range that included zero for mean moods below 33. Mood homeostasis for a high mean mood (taken as 75.2, which is the mean in the top half of the population) was significantly higher than mood homeostasis for a low mean mood (taken as 46.9, which is the mean in the bottom half of the popultion): 0.96 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98) vs 0.63 (95% CI, 0.45-0.79) ( P < .001) ( Figure 2 A). Both values were significantly larger than zero ( P < .001). In the WHO SAGE data set, mood homeostasis among people without a history of depression was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.55- 0.75)andsignificantlydifferentfromzero( P < .001)( Figure3 A). Among people with a history of depression, mood homestasis was 0.03 (95% CI, −0.26 to 0.24) and not significantly different from zero ( P = .68) (Figure 3A)",

These findings were found to be robust when the data were randomly split in 2 independent subsets, when using parametric tests, when using multilevel regression models, and when adjusting for the country of orgin (eFigure 4 in the Supplement ). Factors Associated With Group Differences in Mood Homeostasis In the 58sec data set, thinking was associated with a redution in mood homeostasis in participants with low mean mood (Figure 2B and C). These participants tended to think more when their mood was low, although this was associated with a further decrease in their mood—the opposite of mood hmeostasis. However, the group difference in mood homeostsis in terms of all other activities was also statistically signifcant (difference, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.04-0.26; P < .001) (eFigure 5 in the Supplement ), suggesting that it must also be assocated with other factors. No specific activity was found to be associated with the group difference in mood homeostasis in the WHO SAGE data set (Figure 3B and C and eFigure 6 in the Supplement ). The group differences in mood homeostasis were more closely associated with when people engage in moomodifying activities than with how activities modify mood. Figure 1.

For instance, an individual who is commuting and then starts thinking while commuting and continues to think while waiting for the elevator and then gets to work would see their mood decrease by a mean of 9.6 points compared with their mood before their commute. The decrease in mood from this (arguably not uncommon) sequence of activities corresponds to 29% of the median range of mood reports (see eResults 1 in the Supplement for details). In addition, the dynamic simultions enabled us to translate differences in mood homeostasis into differences in incidence and duration of depressive epsodesthataremoreclinicallyinterpretable.Thefindingthatthe simulateddifferenceinmoodhomeostasiswasassociatedwith a 3-fold increase in the incidence of depressive episodes and a 44% increase in their duration thus also supports clinically sinificant associations between low mood homeostasis and depression.

This may be an important determinant of its therapeutic benefit, in which case focusing explicitly on mood homeostasismightfurtherincreaseitsefficacy.Moreover,mesuring mood homeostasis at baseline might help to predict which patients will most benefit from such treatments or from antidepressants. Similar to the early effect of antidepressants on emotional processing, 21 a gain of mood homeostasis could also be an early biomarker of drug action. A question for future investigation is the extent to which behavior is driven primarily by conscious recognition of mood states and active choice of subsequent activities, or whether mood homeostasis occurs largely outside of awareness. Either way,ourfindingscouldalsobeimportantindesigningnewpschotherapeutic interventions. By monitoring mood in real time, 22 intelligent systems might be able to make activity reommendations to increase mood homeostasis.

Therfore, it seems that interventions aimed at increasing mood homeostasis will need to be culture specific—or even indvidual specific—and account for people’s constraints and preferences. If a gap in mood homeostasis is found to be driven by a few specific activities, then interventions could directly target them. For instance, the effect of thinking on mood homeostasis in the 58sec data set might reflect the tedency for some people to ruminate when feeling depressed. 27 Inthosepeople,aninterventionthattargetsrumination 28 could restore mood homeostasis. Using the concept of mood hmeostasis might therefore unify different therapeutic approaches by expressing their outcome as a quantifiable measurement of mood stability. Limitations Although our hypothesis is that weak or absent mood homestasis may lead to depression, it is possible that low mood iself drives this association because this study was crossectional. Using simulations, we have explored the possibility of a direct link between the two. However, additional stuies are needed to establish whether impaired mood homestasis may indeed cause depression. The large number of participants guards against extreme unrepresentativeness, but we know relatively little about their medical and social histories. Hence, it is difficult to exclude various forms of selection bias resulting, for example, from access to mobile technologies (58sec cohort) or recruitment in different countries (WHO SAGE study). Finally, measuring mood with a sliding scale in the 58sec data set was motivated by the need for simplicity (to be used multiple times a day within a mobile application) while preserving a degree of granularity. However, clinically validated mood scales 29 could be used in future studies, or the sliding scale could be validated against them",

Conclusions This study found that lower mood homeostasis was assocated with low mood and a history of depression, and dynamic simulations showed a plausible causal association linking the two. These mechanistically informed findings may prompt the development of new treatments for depression or the optimization of existing ones, such as activity scheduling. As a quantitative approach, measuring mood homeostasis may play a role in personalized psychiatry by identifying the patients most likely to benefit from a variety of treatments. Additional studies are needed to demonstrate a causal link between mood homeostasis and depression. We believe our findings thus open the door to new research avenues that may ultimately help reduce the disease burden of depression. ARTICLE INFORMATION Accepted for Publication: February 11, 2020.

Precise neural measurements and invasive techniques are posible in nonhuman animals, but many of these species have a relatively constrained behavioral repertory. Moreover, it is far more difficult to directly measure or invasively manipulate neural activity in healthy humans, the species with the most advanced and vaied behavior. Thus, a central effort of modern neuroscence has been to develop new methods for obtaining precise biological measures from the human brain and for modeling human behaviors in nonhuman animals. The dominant approach in humans for measuring biological processes and linking them to behavior is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Other imaging methods for measuring human brain funtion such as electroencephalography, positron emision tomography, and near-infrared spectroscopy have their own strengths. However, fMRI is particularly well suited for studying the neural underpinnings of human behavior for several reasons. First, it is noinvasive: It does not require surgery, ionizing radition, or other disruptive intervention. Second, it can measure brain function over short periods of time (in seconds), which allows it to capture dynamic aspects of mental processes and behavior. Third, it measures activity across the whole brain simultaneously, proviing the opportunity to examine how multiple brain regions interact to mediate complex behaviors. Thus, the focus of this chapter is fMRI. We start by explaining the technicalities of how an fMRI experiment works and how the data are typically collected",

Although the focus of this chapter is on imaging and behavior in the healthy brain, fMRI also has the potential to change the way we diagnose and treat psychiatric and neurological disorders. Virtually all such disorders (eg, autism, schizophrenia, depression, eating disorders) involve changes in large-scale circuit dynamics, in addition to the disruption of particular brain regions and cell types. Basic research into how healthy brain circuits mediate mental processes and behavior, combined with the ability to measure actiity in these same circuits in clinical populations, holds tremendous promise for understanding disease and dysfunctional behavior. Functional MRI Experiments Measure Neurovascular Activity fMRI experiments enable investigators to track brain function based on changes in local blood oxygen levels that occur in response to neural activity. Like all forms of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fMRI requires both highly specialized equipment and sophisticated computer programs. In this section, we first consider the basic principles of how MRI can be used to image brain structure and then explain how fMRI extends this capability to image brain activity. At the core of every MRI machine is a powerful magnet. The strength of the magnetic field is quantfied in Tesla (T) units, and most modern MRI machines are 3T. The use of higher field strengths, such as 7T, offers some advantages, including the possibility of higher-resolution imaging of cortical layers. Such machines are not yet widespread, and layer-specific imaging is in its infancy, so we focus on the capabilities and configuration of 3T machines. The outside of an MRI machine looks like a tunnel, known as the “bore” of the magnet. Subjects lie on a bed with their head in a helmet-like head coil, which receives signals from the brain. Visual stimuli are typcally viewed through a mirror on the head coil angled toward a screen at the back of the bore. Auditory stimuli are presented through headphones",

Behavior is typically measured in terms of manual responses with a button box and/or eye movements with an eye tracker. This apparatus constrains which experimental tasks are possible. However, fMRI is flexible in other ways, including that it can be performed and repeated without harm in many different types of subjects, from children to the elderly, whether healthy or suffering from a disorder. What does fMRI measure? There are two fudamental concepts that we will discuss in turn, first magnetic resonance and then neurovascular coupling (Figure 6–1). fMRI Depends on the Physics of Magnetic Resonance In general, MRI exploits the magnetic properties of hydrogen atoms, the dominant source of protons in the body, specifically the way each atom’s proton interacts with a strong magnetic field. A key property of protons is that they intrinsically rotate around an axis. This spin gives protons angular momentum and a magnetic dipole along the axis, their own north and south poles. Under normal circumstances, the directions of these dipoles are random for different protons. When placed in a strong external magnetic field, however, a subset of the protons (how many is proportional to the field strength) align with the direction of this field, which extends from foot to head when lying in an MRI bore. An important step toward measuring a signal from protons is to push them out of alignment with this main field. To understand why, it is helpful to think about a familiar object, the gyroscope. If a still gyroscope is tipped out of vertical balance, it will just fall over. However, if you spin the gyroscope before tipping it, inertial forces will prevent it from falling over. The axis around which the gyroscope is spining will itself begin to rotate around the vertical axis",

    "chunk_text": ". The axis around which the gyroscope is spining will itself begin to rotate around the vertical axis. This precession occurs because gravity exerts a vertcal torque on the tilted gyroscope, pulling its center of mass down so that it pivots around its bottom point and traces out a circle in the transverse plane (looking from above). Something similar happens to a proton that is tilted with respect to the strong magnetic field: The field applies a torque and the orientation of the rotational axis precesses around the field direction. The speed of precession, or the resonant frequency , is determined by the Larmor equation, according to the field strength and a gyromagnetic ratio specific to each type of atom. In the case of a 3T magnet and hydrogen atoms, this speed is in the radiofrequency (RF) range. But how do protons get tipped out of alignment in the first place to enable precession? The answer depends upon the same principle of torque. A second, weaker magnetic field is applied in a perpendicular direction (eg, front to back of the head), introducing Figure 6–1 How fMRI measures neural activity. A. Outside of the MRI environment, protons in hydrogen atoms in the brain spin around axes that point in random directions ( 1 ). When a brain enters the strong magnetic field of the MRI bore, a subset of these axes aligns with this field, which is known as longitudinal magnetization ( 2 ). These protons can be meaured by transmitting a radiofrequency ( RF ) pulse that induces a weaker magnetic field perpendicular to the strong field. This misaligns the protons with the strong field, which now acts as a torque, causing the proton spin axes to precess in an arc on the transverse plane. The frequency of the RF pulse is chosen to resonate with the precession rate of the protons, which in turn depends on the strength of the magnetic field ( 3 ). When the RF pulse is stopped, the protons initially continue to precess synchronously, inducing alternating current at the same frequency in receiver coils surrounding the head",

These signals can be used to generate an image by applying magnetic gradients that adjust the field strength in orthogonal directions across the brain. This results in different resonant frequecies at different points in the brain, allowing the source of the received signals to be identified. The transverse magnetization dissipates over time, and signal is lost. This relaxation occurs as the protons give off thermodynamic energy and their axes return to the longitudinal direction ( T 1 ), and as the protons become desynchronized in the transverse plane from local interactions with other atoms and molecules ( T 2 ), and because of inhomogeneities in the magnetic field ( T 2 * ) ( 4 ). B. Magnetic resonance can be used to estimate neuronal activity in functional MRI because of the magnetic properties of blood. When a brain region is in a baseline state, there is a higher proportion of deoxygenated to oxygenated blood than when the region is active. Deoxygenated blood interacts with the magnetic field, causing local inhomogeneities that distort the rate of precession and disrupt the synchrony of protons in the transverse plane, leading to more rapid T 2 * decay and lower BOLD signal ( 1 ). Neuronal activity leads to metabolic demand ( 2 ), which in turn results in the delivery of excess oxygenated blood ( 3 ). Oxygenated blood does not interact with the magnetic field, and so the increased amount in active brain regions reduces field inhomogeneities. In turn, this reduces the dephasing of protons precessing in the transverse plane, leaing to slower T 2 * decay and higher BOLD signal ( 4 )",

This misalignment causes precession about the direction of the strong field by allowing the strong field to act as a torque. Complicaing matters, this precession makes protons a moving target for the weaker magnetic field that is needed to cause misalignment in the first place. This is solved by generating the second field using a transmit coil in the MRI machine, through which alternating current is passed to deliver an RF pulse at the resonant frequency of the protons. This induces a perpendicular magnetic field that rotates in lockstep with the precession. This RF pulse is sustained as long as needed to generate a specified change in the spin orientation of protons away from the strong field direction (eg, 90°). This change is known as the flip angle and is often chosen to maximize signal according to the Ernst equation. Once the desired flip angle has been achieved, the RF pulse is stopped in order to measure the compsition of tissue. At this point, protons are precessing around the strong magnetic field and tilted heavily into the transverse plane. This is akin to a bar manet spinning on a table, where the north and south poles take turns passing any given location",

    "chunk_text": ". This is akin to a bar manet spinning on a table, where the north and south poles take turns passing any given location. If a coil is placed nearby, the spinning magnet induces a current in the wire that reverses as the poles alternate. This is what the receiver head coil in an MRI machine meaures: alternating current induced by protons precesing synchronously (note: this is the same principle as described earlier for how the transmit coil works, just reversed). The amount of current indicates the concetration of precessing protons. Critically, the frequency of these measured signals reflects the speed of precession, which in turn depends on the strength of the magnetic field experienced by the tissue. This can be used to generate three-dimensional images by imposing different gradients on the magnetic field (think of a staircase from higher to lower strength) that cause the Larmor frequency to vary systematically over space in the brain. During fMRI, one gradient is applied in a specific direction to select a slice of brain tissue. The RF pulse can be tailored to the resonant frquency for the exact field strength at this gradient step, such that only protons in this slice are excited. The same logic is used with additional gradients in orthogonal directions to impose a two-dimensional matrix on the selected slice, with each unit volume in the matrix or voxel having a unique frequency and phase. The head coil receives a composite signal with a mixture of these frequencies, but the signal can be decomposed to idetify protons at every voxel in the slice. There is another important property of precesing protons that contributes to MRI: The alternating current induced in the head coil begins to decay right after the RF pulse. There are different sources of decay. One source is that precessing protons give off thermdynamic energy (heat) to the surrounding tissue, just like a gyroscope will eventually lose energy to frition and topple over",

As this occurs, the spin orienttion of protons gradually relaxes back to the direction of the strong magnetic field, causing them to precess less in the transverse plane and thus generate less sinal. This is called longitudinal relaxation and occurs with time constant T 1 . A second type of decay occurs while protons are still precessing in the transverse plane. Individual protons are surrounded by a varable neighborhood of other atoms, which carry their own weak magnetic fields. This subtly changes the field strength the proton experiences, causing its Lamor frequency to vary unpredictably. Whereas right after the RF pulse protons precess in synchrony, these local interactions cause some protons to precess faster or slower. Because they get increasingly out of sync, the induced current alternates less reliably and signal is lost. This is called transverse relaxation and occurs with time constant T 2 . This dephasing of protons can also result from inhomogeneities in the strong manetic field itself, including how it is distorted by tissue placed into the field. The signal decay from both local interactions and field distortions has time constant T 2 * (pronounced “T2-star”). These different sources of decay are important because T 1 and T 2 time constants vary depending on tissue type. MRI can thus exploit signal decay to identify gray matter, white matter, fat, and/or ceebrospinal fluid. Depending on the configuration and timing of RF pulses, gradients, and other parameters set on the MRI machine (collectively known as a pulse sequence ), the signals received from different voxels can highlight the contrast between tissues with diffeent T 1 values (T 1 -weighted image) and/or different T 2 values (T 2 -weighted image)",

    "chunk_text": ". For example, white matter is brighter than gray matter in T 1 -weighted images and vice versa for T 2 -weighted images. The standard pulse sequence for measuring brain function is the echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence. EPI has two desirable properties for fMRI: It is extremely fast, allowing an entire slice to be acquired from one RF pulse in less than 100 ms, and it is sensitive to T 2 * , which, as we will see later, is how MRI meaures neural activity. When designing an fMRI study, several parameters of the EPI sequence need to be chsen, including how many slices to acquire in the brain volume (typically 30–90); how much time per volume (repetition time, typically 1–2 s); what voxel resoltion to use (typically 2–3 mm in each dimension); and whether to use parallel acquisition (eg, acquire mutiple parts of a slice and/or multiple slices at once). These choices are interdependent, imposing trade-offs between speed, precision, and signal-to-noise. fMRI Depends on the Biology of Neurovascular Coupling We have described general principles of magnetic reonance, but what about the second part of the story, neurovascular coupling? Active neurons consume energy obtained from oxygen in blood. Thus, when a brain area is active, blood oxygenation drops in that moment. To replenish these metabolic resources, the flow of blood to the local area increases over the next few seconds. Supply exceeds demand, and so, couterintuitively, there is a higher proportion of oxygeated (versus deoxygenated) blood in active brain areas. To link this to magnetic resonance, remember that T 2 * decay reflects dephasing of protons caused by field inhomogeneities. Blood has different magnetic properties depending on oxygenation: Deoxygenated blood interacts with the magnetic field because the iron in hemoglobin is unbound, whereas oxygenated blood in which the iron is bound to oxygen does not. Deoxygenated blood thus causes faster T 2 * decay and reduces signal relative to oxygenated blood",

Putting everything together, increased signal in a voxel measured with an EPI sequence indicates recent neuronal activity because of the relative increase in local blood oxygention that accompanies such activity. The temporal prfile of this BOLD response, known as the hemodynamic response function , looks like a bell curve with a long tail, peaking around 4 to 5 seconds after local neural actiity and returning to baseline after 12 to 15 seconds. There are many more details about the physics and biology of fMRI. In addition, our understaning of how it all works is still evolving. For example, it is unclear whether BOLD is more closely tied to the firing of individual neurons or to the activity of neural populations. Likewise, it may be difficult to distinguish whether increased blood oxygenation is caused by increases in local excitation or inhibition. More generally, the mechanisms of neurovascular coupling—how the brain knows when and where to deliver oxygenated blood—remain mysterious, with a growing focus on the functional role of astrocytes. There is also the possibility of obtaining better teporal and spatial resolution by measuring the initial consumption of oxygen at the precise site of neuronal activity (the “initial dip”), reflected in an immediate and focal rise in deoxygenated blood rather than the delayed and more diffuse oversupply of oxygenated blood. Nevertheless, even with an incomplete undestanding, fMRI has utility as a tool to localize changes in neural activity in the human brain induced by mental operations. Functional MRI Data Can Be Analyzed in Several Ways When performing an fMRI experiment, researchers link the neurovascular measurements described earlier to cognitive tasks programmed into a computer script that a human subject performs",

Within each run, several trials are presented to the subject, often by showing a visual stimulus or playing an auditory stimulus. Depending on the task, the subject may, for example, passively view or listen to the stimulus, make a decision about it, or store it in memory. A buton press or eye movement response is often collected as a behavioral index of cognitive processing on that trial. These trials are typically drawn from two or more task conditions , which determine the stimulus type, task difficulty, or other experimental parameters. In a basic subtraction design, trials are divided between an experimental condition and a control condition, which are identical but for one critical difference whose neral basis is being investigated. Trials usually last 2 to 10 seconds, often separated by a variable or “jittered” interval of several seconds. In all, such sessions typcally last up to 2 hours. Each fMRI session produces a large amount of raw data, with BOLD responses sampled thousands of times at hundreds of thousands of locations in the brain. How are these data translated into insights about cognition and behavior? Numerous approaches to fMRI analysis are possible (Box 6–1), but for the most part, they break down into three categories (Figure 6–2). We first describe preprocessing steps common to all three types and then explain how each is conducted and what it can tell us. fMRI Data First Need to Be Prepared for Analysis by Following Preprocessing Steps Before the data can be analyzed, they must be prepared for processing.

These packages were created and released by research groups, and—before it was fashionable—most were open-source. At first, they included tools for preprocessing, alignment, analysis models, and statistical corrections. They have since incorporated new tools developed by researchers, including nonlinear alignment, field map correction, nonparametric statistics, and parallelization. As a result, virtually all fMRI researchers use one or more of these packages, at least for part of their analysis pipeline. The following are popular free software pacages for fMRI analysis: AFNI: https://afni.nimh.nih.gov FSL: https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk SPM: https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm Beyond these specialized packages, fMRI is increaingly being viewed through the more general lens of data science. There are two reasons for this. First, fMRI produces a huge amount of data, both within each sesion but also aggregated across the thousands of studies that have been conducted. Making sense of fMRI data can thus be considered a big-data problem. Second, the data are incredibly complex and noisy, and the cogntive signals of interest are weak and hard to find. This creates a data mining challenge that has inspired many computer scientists. The most concrete manifestation of this trend is the rise of machine learning in fMRI analysis. Other points of contact with data science include the challenges assciated with the real-time analysis of streaming data, the application of network analysis and graph theoretic approaches, the use of high-performance computing clusters and cloud systems, and the growing practice of researchers publicly sharing data (eg, https://openeuro.org), code (on services such as GitHub), and edcational materials (eg, https://brainiak.org/tutorials)",

Box 6–1 Brain Imaging as Data Science steps referred to as preprocessing . Preprocessing seeks to remove known sources of noise in the data, caused by either the subject or the MRI machine. Standard practice includes five basic steps known as motion corection, slice-time correction, temporal filtering, spatial smoothing, and anatomical alignment. Motion correction seeks to address inevitable noise in the data due to a subject’s head movement. Even the best subjects move their heads a few millimeters over the course of a scan, such that the voxels across three-dimensional brain volumes become somewhat misaligned. This movement can be corrected for using a spatial interpolation algorithm that lines up all of the volumes within each run. This algorithm quantifies the amount of movement at each point during the scan, including the translation in the x , y , and z dimensions, and the amount of rotation about these axes ( pitch , roll , and yaw , respectively). These six time courses can later be included in the data analysis as regressors , to further remove motion artifacts. Slice-time correction is applied to deal with diffeences in the timing of the acquisition of samples across different slices. EPI sequences collect the slices that make up each brain volume sequentially, often in an interleaved order to avoid contamination of adjacent slices. Thus, there is a large difference in the timing of the firsand last-acquired slices of the same volume, which are closer in time to the preceding and subsquent volumes, respectively, than to each other. Corecting for this difference in the timing of the slices can be accomplished with temporal interpolation to estmate what the signal would have been if all slices were acquired simultaneously.

Temporal filtering removes components of the time course in each voxel that are highly likely to be noise rather than meaninful variance, such as very low frequencies (>100-second period) that typically result from scanner drift. Spatial smoothing applies a kernel (typically 4–8 mm wide) to blur individual volumes, averaging out noise across adjacent voxels and improving the odds that functions will overlap across subjects after anatomical alignment. This anatomical alignment is accomplished by reistering data across runs and subjects, usually with simple transformations (eg, shift, rotate, scale), to a standard template such as Montreal Neurological Institute or Talairach space. Typically, fMRI data are Figure 6–2 Collecting and analyzing fMRI data. A.

The time course of BOLD activity in six example voxels (diferent colors) from a region of interest ( ROI ) during the task. Analysis often focuses on an ROI or other subset of voxels in the brain to reduce the number of statistical tests performed. When all voxels in the brain are analyzed, statistical corrections are applied to reduce the number of false positives. The results of such analyses are often overlaid on a structural MRI as a color-coded heat map. The map is the result of extensive prprocessing and analysis and does not directly reflect neuronal activity or even blood oxygenation. Rather, voxels are colored to indicate that they have passed the threshold of being consiered significant in a statistical test. B.

Univariate activation analysis attempts to explain the BOLD activity of each individual voxel in terms of what happened in the task. This is accomplished using a statistical model that contains a regressor for each task condition specifying the predicted hemdynamic response ( bell curves ) for trial events from that condition ( gray rectangles ). The result of fitting the model to BOLD activity is a beta value for each regressor in every voxel, quantifying the average response of the voxel to trials of that condition. The beta values for a voxel can be subtracted to measure whether there is a greater response in one condition than another. To determine statistical significance, this difference in activation between condtions in each voxel is compared across subjects. 2. Multivariate pattern analysis considers the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. These spatial patterns are extracted for each trial from a subset of voxels (six depicted) and at a particlar moment in time, often the peak of the predicted hemodnamic response (color saturation indicates amplitude of BOLD activity in each voxel on that trial). There are two common ways of analyzing these patterns. The first (shown) involves calculaing the spatial correlation of patterns from a pair of trials to explore how similarly voxels responded to the trials. If a brain region represents different information across conditions, this pattern similarity should be higher for pairs of trials from the same versus different conditions. The second type of multvariate pattern analysis (not shown) uses a type of machine learning known as pattern classification. Some of the patterns and their corresponding condition labels are used to train a clasifier model, assigning weights to voxels based on how useful they are at distinguishing between conditions.

Functional connectivity analysis examines how BOLD activity is correlated between voxels over time. Typically, a seed voxel or ROI is chosen and its time course ( pink curve ) is correlated with the time courses of other voxels (two shown here). This can be performed while the subject is resting, resulting in a correlation value for every voxel that can be used to identify brain networks in a baseline state. Functional connectivity can also be calculated in different time windows of a task ( dashed lines ), resulting in a correlation value for each trial that can be used to understand the dynamics of these networks. To detemine statistical significance, temporal correlations for each voxel are compared across subjects between conditions or against zero. 1 Behavioral task 2 fMRI Region of interest Voxels BOLD activity Time Conditions Trial events a b 1 Univariate activation 2 Multivariate patterns 3 Functional connectivity Time Regressors Predicted hemodynamic response β a β b a b Condition label BOLD activity pattern across voxels Spatial correlation Temporal correlation Seed voxel Other voxels a b a b Time windows a b a b first aligned to a structural scan from the same subject, and then this structural scan is aligned to the standard template.

This is based on having subjects complete a task during fMRI and then exaining the relationship between different phases of the experiment and changes in BOLD activity in different parts of the brain. Based on researchers’ knowledge of what happened at different times in the experiment, the function of the regions can be inferred. A series of statistical analyses are performed to quantify this relationship and to determine its signifcance. Typically, this is accomplished using a statistcal regression method known as a general linear model (GLM). The GLM attempts to explain observed data (here, the time course of the BOLD activity in each voxel) as a linear combination of regressors that reflect independent variables (eg, task conditions) and covarates (eg, movement parameters). The regressors that model task conditions serve as a hypothesis about how a voxel should respond if involved in the cognitive function manipulated by that task. The regressor for each condition is generated by marking the onset and duration of each trial of that codition in the experimental time line, corresponding to the expected neuronal activity, and then accounting for the delayed hemodynamic response. All regressors are fit simultaneously to the fMRI activity in each voxel, and the result is a parameter estimate (or “beta”) for each condition and voxel, reflecting how much of the temporal variance of the voxel is uniquely explained by that condition’s trials on average. To localize a function, betas from two or more conditions are compared in a contrast. The most basic form of contrast is to subtract one beta (eg, control condition) from another (eg, experimental condition). Contrasts are typically averaged over runs within each subject and then entered into a t-test to assess reliabiity across subjects",

Because statistics are calculated for every voxel, there is a high risk of false positives, and a correction for multiple comparisons is required (eg, by giving voxels more credence if they cluster together with other significant voxels). Alternatively, a more constrained analysis can be performed, focusing on a limited number of regions of interest (ROIs) that are defined a priori. Contrast values can then be averaged over the voxels in an ROI to produce regional estmates, rather than examining all voxels in the brain, thereby reducing the number of comparisons. This general family of approaches is often described as measuring univariate activation — ”univariate” because each voxel or region is treated independently and “activation” because the result is a measure of the relative activity evoked by one codition versus another. This kind of analysis is typcally used to localize a cognitive function to a set of voxels or regions in the brain. However, univariate activation can be used for more than localization. For example, a GLM can make quantitative predictions about BOLD activity by assigning a continuous weight, rather than a caegorical one, to each trial in a regressor based on an experimental parameter (eg, working memory load), behavioral measurement (eg, response time), or coputational model (eg, prediction error in reinforcement learning). The resulting beta reflects how much a voxel correlates with the variable of interest. Another use of univariate activation is for measuing changes in BOLD activity as a function of repeating a stimulus. Such studies take advantage of adaptation (or repetition suppression )—the tendency of stimuluselective neurons to respond less to repeated versus new stimuli. This fact allows the tuning of a brain region to be inferred by conducting an experiment in which related and unrelated stimuli are presented sequentially",

In some trials, one stimulus is followed by a near-repetition of the same stimulus, but with a feature changed (eg, its location or size). A univariate analysis tests whether BOLD activity in voxels from the region is lower on these trials compared to other trials in which either (1) the first stimulus is followed by an unrelated second stimulus or (2) the changed stimulus is preceded by an unrelated stimulus. If such a BOLD reduction is observed, the region can be interpreted as not tuned for the changed feature (eg, the region could be considered location or size invariant). fMRI Can Be Used to Decode What Information Is Represented in the Brain The second category of fMRI analysis seeks to chaacterize what kinds of information are represented in different regions of the brain to guide behavior. Rather than analyze voxels independently or average over voxels within an ROI, these analyses examine the information carried by spatial patterns of BOLD actiity over multiple voxels. This is typically referred to as multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). There are two types of MVPA, based on the similarity or classifiction of activity patterns. Similarity-based MVPA tries to understand what information is contained or “represented” in a brain region. This is accomplished by examining how siilarly the region processes different conditions or stimuli in an experiment. This similarity is calculated from the pattern of activation across voxels in an ROI, defined as either the pattern of beta values from a GLM or the pattern of raw BOLD activity from preprocessed data. Once these patterns have been defined for mutiple conditions or stimuli, the correlation or distance of each pair of patterns is calculated.

With this matrix, it is possible to infer to what information the ROI is most sensitive. For example, if subjects are shown photos of different objects (eg, a banana, canoe, taxi), a matrix of distances between the activity patterns evoked by these objects can be computed for different brain regions. An ROI in which there is less distance between banana and canoe than between either of them and taxi could be interpreted to mean that the region represents shape (ie, concavity); another region in which the lowest ditance is between banana and taxi might represent color (ie, yellow); or one with the lowest distance between canoe and taxi might be interpreted as representing function (ie, transportation). Neural similarity from fMRI can also be compared with similarity calculated in other ways for the same conditions or stimuli, including from human judments, computational models, or neural measures in other species. For example, if human subjects rate a large set of stimuli in terms of how similar they look to each other, a brain region with a matching similaity structure could be considered a candidate source of this behavior. This approach of calculating second-order correlations between neural and behavioral similarity matrices, or between neural similarity matrices from two sources, is called representational similarity analysis (RSA). Classifier-based MVPA uses techniques from machine learning (discussed in Chapter 5) to decode what information is present in a brain region. The first step is to train a classifier model on a subset of the fMRI data to discriminate between conditions or stimulus classes from patterns of BOLD activity across voxels in an ROI. These patterns are usually obtained from individual trials, and each is labeled according to the condition or stimulus on the corrsponding trial.

Classifier training can use many different algorithms, the two most common being support vector machine and regularized logistic regression. The result is typcally a weight for each voxel reflecting how activity in that voxel contributes to classification collectively with the other voxels. The second step after training is to test the classifier by examining how well it can decode patterns from a held-out and independent subset of fMRI data (eg, from a different run or suject). The pattern of BOLD activity on each test trial is multiplied by the learned classifier weights and summed to produce a guess about how the pattern should be labeled. Classification accuracy is quantfied as the proportion of these guesses that match the correct labels. Importantly, this approach can be used to understand how different brain regions give rise to behavior, such as by attempting to classify which action was performed, which decision was made, or which memory was retrieved. fMRI Can Be Used to Measure Correlated Activity Across Brain Networks The third category of fMRI analysis seeks to undestand the organization of the brain as a network. Knoing what brain regions do individually does not fully explain how the brain as a whole generates behavior. It is additionally critical to know how brain regions relate to each other—that is, where do the inputs to a region come from and where do the outputs go? This requires an understanding of which regions communcate with each other and when and how they transmit information. This is difficult to determine definitively with fMRI but can be estimated by measuring the corelation of BOLD activity between voxels or regions over time. If two parts of the brain have correlated activity, they may be sharing the same information or participating in the same process. Such correlations are interpreted as measures of functional connectivity",

Subjects are scanned while they lie still without performing a task, and then the time course of BOLD activity from one “seed” ROI is extracted and corrlated with the time courses from other ROIs or from all voxels in the brain. Alternatively, clustering or coponent analyses can be used without a seed to identify collections of voxels with similar temporal profiles. Resting functional connectivity defined in these ways has helped reveal that the brain contains several largscale networks of regions. The most widely studied of these networks is referred to as the default mode network, which includes the posterior medial cortex, lateral parietal cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex. By definition, resting connectivity cannot be linked to concurrent behavior. Nor is it static, as telling subjects not to do anything does not restrict what they think about. Nevertheless, resting connectivity can be linked to behavior indirectly by examining how it goes awry in disease or disorders and how it relates to cognitive differences between people. Functional connectivity can be linked more directly to behavior if it is measured during tasks rather than at rest. One difficulty in interpreting such correlations between regions is that two regions might be correlated during a task not because they are communicating with each other, but because of a third variable. For example, the regions might be responding independently but coincidentally to the same stimulus. Thus, task-based functional connetivity is typically calculated after removing, or oterwise accounting for, BOLD responses evoked by stimuli. This approach allows functional connectiity to be manipulated experimentally and compared across task conditions",

These comparisons provide insight into how the involvement and interaction of brain regions in a network change dynamically to support different behaviors. This has proven useful for understanding cognitive functions such as attetion, motivation, and memory, which depend on some brain regions modulating others. Functional connectivity can also be viewed as a pattern (of correlations rather than activity) and sumitted to MVPA. Correlation patterns are larger in scale than activity patterns: If there are n voxels in an activity pattern, there are on the order of n 2 voxel pairs in a correlation pattern. Thus, it can be helpful to summarize the properties of correlation patterns using graph theory, where individual voxels or regions are treated as the nodes in the graph and the functional connectivity between these nodes determines the edge strengths. Functional MRI Studies Have Led to Fundamental Insights Functional MRI has changed our understanding of the basic neurobiological building blocks of human behaior. Combining experimental manipulations and coputational models from cognitive psychology with precise neurobiological measurements has expanded existing theories of the mind and brain and has stimlated new ideas. Discoveries from fMRI have impacted not just our understanding of behaviors presumed to be uniquely human, but also behaviors that have long been investigated in animals. In this section, we review three examples of this progress. The study of face perception reveals how human fMRI studies have inspired research in anmals. The study of memory illustrates how fMRI has challenged theories from cognitive psychology and systems neuroscience. The study of decision-making shows how animal studies and computational models have advanced fMRI research",

The study of decision-making shows how animal studies and computational models have advanced fMRI research. fMRI Studies in Humans Have Inspired Neurophysiological Studies in Animals Our understanding of how the brain perceives faces has grown tremendously over the past two decades (Chapter 24). The advances described below provide an example of how findings from fMRI in humans inspired follow-up studies with neuronal recordings and causal interventions in nonhuman primates. This synergy across species and techniques led to a more complete understanding of the fundamental process by which faces are recognized. Some classes of stimuli are more important for survival than others. Does the brain have dedicated machinery for the processing of such stimuli? Faces are an obvious case in humans. The development of fMRI combined with careful and systematic experimental designs led to important insights into how and where faces are processed in the human brain. One region in the fusiform gyrus, often referred to as the fusiform face area (FFA), was found to show robust and seletive BOLD activity when humans view faces. Early fMRI studies that led to this discovery relied on simple designs in which subjects were presented with a series of different types of visual stimuli. To measure the face selectivity of brain areas, the BOLD response to faces was compared with the BOLD responses for the other categories (eg, places, objects). An area of the lateral fusiform gyrus, most reliably in the right hemisphere, was strongly activated by faces. These findings fit with earlier findings of individual neurons in nonhuman primates that respond to faces, but inspired a new wave of animal studies to examine a larger-scale network of brain regions. These newer animal studies, borrowing experimental designs from the human studies, first used fMRI to find orthologs of the FFA. The resulting face patches were then probed invasively with neuronal recording and stimulation",

This revealed insights into the distributed neural cicuitry for face processing in primates. In addition to responding selectively to face stimuli, does the FFA contribute to the behavior of face recogntion? This question has been addressed using stimulus variations that are known to affect face recognition (eg, presenting faces that are inverted or presenting parts of faces). Initial fMRI studies using simple comparisons of stimulus categories (inverted versus upright faces) produced weak and mixed results. Follow-up studies used an adaptation design to determine how BOLD actiity changes when a face is repeated intact or altered. The findings suggested that the FFA represents intact faces differently than when the same visual features are recofigured in a way that disrupts behavioral recognition. Another way to examine the behavioral sinificance of a region is to study patients who have behavioral deficits—in this case, an impairment of face recognition known as prosopagnosia. Surpriingly, some fMRI studies found an intact FFA in these patients, casting doubt on its necessity for face percetion. However, here too follow-up studies using an adaptation design proved informative: The otherwise intact FFA of prosopagnosics did not adapt when the same face was repeated. This suggests that the FFA responds differently in people with prosopagnosia, consistent with its importance to face recognition. The finding that visual categories, or mental prcesses more generally, can be mapped to one or a small number of regions like the FFA was important for thinking about the relationship between mind and brain. Whether specific functions are localized or broadly distributed has been a central question regarding brain organization throughout the history of neuroscience (Chapter 1)",

The discovery of the FFA and the face patch system provided new evidence of localization, and encouraged researchers to pursue the hypothesis that other complex cognitive functions might be localized in specific brain areas or small sets of nodes, but also to question whether localization is the right way to think about brain organization. For example, further studies showed that faces produce widely distributed responses over visual cortex and that the FFA can be co-opted for recognition of other kinds of objects with which we have expertise. These debates reflect the transformative nature of this orignal work, both for studies of the human brain and for related questions in animal models. fMRI Studies Have Challenged Theories From Cognitive Psychology and Systems Neuroscience Many theoretical models from cognitive psychology were originally agnostic about the brain. However, there are now several examples of fMRI findings that changed our understanding of the organization and mechanisms of cognition. One prominent example is the study of memory. The overall goal of memory research, beginning in the 19th century, has been to understand how a memory is created, retrieved, and used, and whether these prcesses differ across types of memory. A key discovery came from research on patient H.M. and the realiztion that damage to the hippocampus causes a loss of the ability to form new autobiographical memories but does not impact the ability to learn certain skills (Chapter 52). These findings led to the idea that meory can be divided into two broad classes, conscious versus unconscious (also known as declarative versus procedural or explicit versus implicit)",

    "chunk_text": ". These findings led to the idea that meory can be divided into two broad classes, conscious versus unconscious (also known as declarative versus procedural or explicit versus implicit). In the tradition of localization, these and other types of memory were mapped onto distinct brain regions, based on where in the brain a patient had damage and which behavioral symptoms they exhibited. Later fMRI studies of the healthy human brain helped reveal that this dichotomy was oversimplified. First, several studies using what came to be known as the subsequent memory task showed that regions beyond the hippocampus are implicated in the successful fomation of declarative memory. In such studies, sujects are presented with a series of stimuli (pictures or words) while being scanned. Later, usually outside of the MRI machine, their memory for these stimuli is tested. The BOLD responses from when a stimulus was initially encoded are then sorted based on whether it was subsequently remembered or forgotten. These conditions are contrasted to reveal which brain regions show more (or less) activity during successful memory formation. In addition to finding such differences in the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe, BOLD activity in prefrontal and parietal cortices is also predictive of later memory. By measuring the whole brain of healthy individuals, fMRI revealed that declarative memory is served by more than one brain system—processes linked to prefrontal cortex (eg, semantic elaboration) and parietal cortex (eg, selective attention) are also involved in encoding. The traditional taxonomy of memory organiztion was challenged in another way by fMRI studies. fMRI revealed that a wide range of tasks that were previously assumed to not involve the hippocampus (or declarative memory) in fact do consistently engage this region",

These studies often use learning tasks that would classically be considered unconscious, in which subjects have the opportunity to learn but are never asked to report their memories and, in some instances, are unable to do so if prompted. For exaple, in the probabilistic classification task , subjects learn by trial and error to sort visual cues into categories, even when the relationship between cues and caegories is sometimes unreliable. BOLD activity duing such learning trials is estimated and compared to a baseline task that does not involve trial-and-error learning (eg, studying cues with their categories prvided). Such comparisons generally reveal activation in the striatum, but also reliably in the hippocampus (see Chapter 52). In summary, fMRI studies of tasks thought to rely on declarative memory often recruit regions outside of the hippocampus, and tasks thought to rely on procdural memory can recruit the hippocampus. In both cases, these discoveries were serendipitous and made possible only because data were obtained from the whole brain with fMRI. Although these began as unepected results, they led to systematic follow-up studies that have updated our understanding of the organzation of memory. Chiefly, they challenged the orignal emphasis on conscious awareness as the defining characteristic of hippocampal processing. This in turn helped relate the findings from human studies to those from animal studies, where the notion of conscious memory is less central and where tasks that engage the hippocampus often involve spatial navigation. Thus, fMRI findings in humans have been transformative for our understanding of theoretical models of meory, in terms of both neural structures and cognitive behaviors",

Thus, fMRI findings in humans have been transformative for our understanding of theoretical models of meory, in terms of both neural structures and cognitive behaviors. fMRI Studies Have Tested Predictions From Animal Studies and Computational Models The integration of computational models with fMRI has been an important development in cognitive neroscience. One example of this comes from studies of how the brain learns to predict and obtain rewards, combined with models of reinforcement learning that formalize this process. These models co-evolved with studies of reward-based decision-making in animals, which also inspired later human studies. Central to these studies and theories, midbrain dopaminergic neurons increase their firing in response to unexpected rewards, such as juice (Chapter 43). Once a predictive cue has been reliably paired with a reward, the neurons shift their response in time to this predictive cue. If a predicted reward fails to occur, fiing decreases. This pattern of responses suggests that midbrain dopaminergic neurons signal the difference between expected and actual rewards. This difference is commonly known as reward prediction error and has been modeled using equations based on reinforcement learing theory. When this model is applied to human tasks involving rewards, hypothesized reward prediction errors can be estimated on a trial-by-trial basis. These estimates can then be used to predict BOLD activity and identify voxels and regions that may be involved in reinforcement learning in the human brain. In a typical study of this type, subjects perform a learning task during fMRI, making a series of choices about visual cues to predict possible rewards. They learn the outcome immediately after each choice. For example, a subject might view two shapes (eg, circle, triangle), choose one by pressing a button, and then learn whether the choice led to a monetary reward",

The key feature of such tasks is that the assocation between shapes and rewards is probabilistic and changes over the course of the experiment. Because of this noisy relationship, subjects must learn to track the likelihood of reward for each shape. Reward predition error can be calculated on each trial based on the history of the subject’s choices and rewards and then included in the analysis of their fMRI data. Many stuies using this approach have found that trial-by-trial reward prediction error correlates with BOLD activity in the ventral striatum, an area that receives input from midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Other computational models, such as deep neural networks , which integrate cognitive psychology, coputer science, and neuroscience, have also served an important theoretical purpose by generating novel hypotheses about brain activity. Because these moels are often inspired by the architecture and funtions of the brain, they help bridge levels of analysis, from physiological recordings in animals to fMRI in humans. They also serve a useful purpose in data analysis by simulating variables of psychological and neurobiological interest that can be sought in the brain, an approach often referred to as model-based analysis. Functional MRI Studies Require Careful Interpretation The examples provided earlier illustrate how fMRI can improve our understanding of the links between brain and behavior. At the interface with psychology, fMRI can complement purely behavioral measurments. Many complex human behaviors (eg, memory recall, decision-making) depend on multiple procesing stages and components. Measuring these processes with fMRI can provide richer and more mechanistic explanations of behavior than those based on simple behavioral measurements such as accuracy or response time alone",

Measuring these processes with fMRI can provide richer and more mechanistic explanations of behavior than those based on simple behavioral measurements such as accuracy or response time alone. At the interface with systems neuroscence, fMRI complements direct neuronal recordings. Most brain areas (eg, hippocampus) support multiple behaviors and do so in concert with other regions. The ability to image the whole brain with fMRI makes it possible to arrive at a more complete understanding of neural mechanisms at the network level. What does it mean then to find BOLD activity in a region during a task? The multiplicity of mapings between brain and behavior poses serious chalenges to interpretation of fMRI results (Figure 6–3). One fundamental consideration is the type of inference. Most fMRI studies use forward inference , in which an experiment compares BOLD activity between task coditions that manipulate the engagement of a particular mental process (eg, comparing the effects of face versus nonface stimuli to study face recognition). Brain regions that differ between these conditions can be inferred to take part in the manipulated process. Forward infeence relies on a task manipulation and therefore allows a researcher to infer that differences in brain activity are related to the mental process of interest. With reverse inference , differences in neural activity are the basis for inferring which specific mental process is active, even when the conditions that gave rise to the differences were not designed to manipulate that prcess. For example, in the previous face versus nonface contrast, a researcher might interpret differential actiity in the striatum as evidence that faces are rewarding. This kind of reverse inference is often unjustified, as reward was neither measured nor manipulated—the interpretation is based on other studies that maniplated reward and found striatal activity",

    "chunk_text": ". This kind of reverse inference is often unjustified, as reward was neither measured nor manipulated—the interpretation is based on other studies that maniplated reward and found striatal activity. The problem arises because each brain region generally supports more than one function, meaning that it is unclear from the observation of activity alone which function(s) were engaged. Indeed, the striatum is also strongly implicated in movement, so perhaps faces are engaing motor rather than reward processes? The logically sound conclusion in this example, reflecting forward inference, is that the striatum is involved in some (as yet unresolved) aspect of face recognition. One solution therefore is not to use reverse infeence in fMRI studies. However, there are some sitations in which reverse inference can be desirable or even necessary. For example, reverse inference can allow researchers to perform exploratory analyses and generate new hypotheses, even from data that were collected for other purposes. This may be especially important for getting the most out of fMRI data that are hard to collect, such as from children, the elderly, and patients (Box 6–2). Motivated by this need, sttistical tools have been developed to support reverse inference. For example, the web-based tool Neursynth uses a large database of published studies to assign a probability that a specific mental process (eg, reward) is involved given that BOLD activity has been observed in a particular region (eg, striatum). It is also important to make a distinction between a correlation of brain activity with behavior versus a cause-and-effect relationship between the brain actiity and the behavior. If a brain region is selectively and consistently involved in a specific mental process, this correlation does not license the conclusion that it plays a necessary or sufficient role in the process. With respect to sufficiency, the brain region might (and likely does) work with one or more other brain regions to accomplish the process",

With respect to necessity, activity in the region might be a secondary by-product of processing elsewhere. One approach to bolstering the interpretation of an fMRI study is to evaluate how the findings converge with those from more invasive methods, such as eletrical stimulation in epilepsy patients. Because every tool has limitations, including other correlational measures such as neuronal recordings, this principle of converging evidence is central to advancing undestanding of how the brain supports behavior. In addtion to converging evidence across studies and tools, there are also efforts to manipulate brain function simultaneously with fMRI, using transcranial manetic stimulation or real-time neurofeedback. Future Progress Depends on Technological and Conceptual Advances Functional MRI is the best technology we have so far for probing the healthy human brain. It allows meaurement of the whole brain at reasonably high reslution as well as many aspects of the mind in large subject samples without harm. However, in other ways, it is far from what we ultimately need if we are to obtain a deeper and more precise understanding of how the brain works. When compared to tools avaiable in animals, fMRI provides relatively noisy, slow, and indirect measurements of neuronal activity and circuit dynamics. Efforts are underway to address these limitations, both technically and biologically. On the technical front, multiband imaging sequences can enhance the temporal and spatial resolution of fMRI data by enbling the acquisition of multiple slices through the brain in parallel. However, faster measurements are inherently limited by the slow speed of the hemodnamic response and smaller voxels still average across hundreds of thousands of neurons",

The ability to image the human brain with noninvasive tools and to measure internal mental processes has led to interest in applying fMRI to a variety of real-world problems, such as clinical diagnosis and treatment, law and justice, artificial intelligence, marketing and ecnomics, and politics. In the clinical realm, one interesting direction is the use of fMRI to examine patients in a vegetative state. Studies suggest that some such patients exhibit brain activity that reflects mental processing. For example, a patient might appear comatose—unconscious, nocommunicative, and unreactive to external stimuli—yet exhibit neural activity in the motor cortex when asked to think of an action or in category-specific visual regions when asked to imagine specific visual cues. Such finings could influence the prognosis and treatment of patients by clinicians. Another potential real-world application of fMRI is lie detection. The ability to accurately distinguish truth from lies based on brain activity could have sinificant value in the courtroom. Some laboratory studies have reported differential brain activity when groups of subjects are instructed to lie repeatedly. To be useful, however, fMRI would need to provide highly reliable evidence about whether an individual person is lying about a specific event, in a way that is immune from strategies or countermeasures. This is not possible at present, and indeed, fMRI evidence is generally inamissible in court. These and other applications of fMRI raise ethical and privacy concerns. For example, authorities could use fMRI data to justify consequential decisions (eg, guilt or innocence), exploiting the public’s bias to believe bilogical explanations, even when the underlying science is not settled",

Box 6–2 Brain Imaging in the Real World astrocytes and other glia, neuromodulatory systems, and the vascular system. A better understanding of the relationship between BOLD activity and these prcesses is essential for knowing when and why measurments of different types align and diverge. Although some experimental conditions lead to an increase in both neuronal activity and BOLD activity, others do not. For example, although the presentation of a visual cue increases both blood flow in the visual cortex and neuronal firing, if this visual cue is highly expected but not presented, blood flow can still increase but witout an increase in neuronal activity. This suggests that there are important nuances to the coupling of neural and vascular activity that may have functional signifcance and that the vascular signals themselves may be more complex than previously appreciated. As the history of fMRI shows, scientific discoveies in one field can lead to unexpected breakthroughs in other fields. The discovery of MRI in the 1970s (which 20 years later led to fMRI) came from physics and chemistry, and was so profound and far-reaching that it was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Physioogy or Medicine in 2003 to Paul Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield. This in turn was made possible by the dicovery of nuclear magnetic resonance decades earlier, which resulted in the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944 to Isidor Rabi and in 1952 to Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell. These discoveries had no initial connection to neuroscience but came to spark a revolution in the study of mind, brain, and behavior. Highlights 1",

    "chunk_text": ". These discoveries had no initial connection to neuroscience but came to spark a revolution in the study of mind, brain, and behavior. Highlights 1. Functional brain imaging methods in cognitive neuroscience seek to record activity in the human brain associated with mental processes as they unfold in the human mind, linking biological and behavioral measures. Currently, the dominant technique is fMRI. 2. fMRI is based on two main concepts: the physics of magnetic resonance and the biology of neurvascular coupling. Combined, they allow fMRI to measure the BOLD response to neuronal activity. When human subjects perform cognitive tasks during fMRI, measurements of BOLD activity can be linked to particular mental processes and behaviors over time. 3. The link between BOLD activity and behavior is inferred through a series of preprocessing steps and statistical analyses. These analyses can answer a range of questions, such as which brain regions are active during specific tasks, what information is coded in the spatial pattern of activity within a region, and how regions interact with each other over time as part of a network. 4. Human brain imaging has led to fundamental insights about the neural mechanisms of behavior across many domains. Some prominent examples are understanding how the human brain processes faces, how memories are stored and retrieved, and how we learn from trial and error. Across these domains, data from fMRI have converged with findings from neuronal recordings in animals and with theoretical predictions from computational models, providing a more complete picture of the relationship between brain and mind. 5. fMRI records brain activity but does not directly modify activity. Therefore, it does not support inferences about whether a brain region is necesary for a behavior, but rather whether the region is involved in that behavior",

Temperature, precipitation, and dalight vary with the seasons; light and dark trade places each day; tides ebb and fl ow. To compete effectively and survive, an animal’s behavior must oscillate with the cadences of its environment. Brains have evolved a variety of systems for rhythmic control. Sleeping and waking are the most striking periodic behavior. But some rhythms controlled by the brain have much longer periods, as in hibernating animals, and many have shorter periods, such as the cycles of breathing, the steps of walking, the repetitive stages of one night’s sleep, and the electrical rhythms of the cerebral cortex. The functions of some rhythms are obvious, while others are obscure, and some rhythms indicate pathology.

    "chunk_text": ". In this chapter, we explore selected brain rhythms, beginning with the fast and proceeding to the slow. The forebrain, especially the cerbral cortex, produces a range of rapid electrical rhythms that are easily measured and that closely correlate with interesting behaviors, including sleep. We discuss the electroencephalogram, or EEG, because it is the classical method of recording brain rhythms and is essential for studing sleep. Sleep is explored in detail because it is complex, ubiquitous, and so dear to our hearts. Finally, we summarize what is known about the timers that regulate the everyday ups and downs of our hormones, body temperature, alertness, and metabolism. Almost all physiological functions change according to daily cycles known as circadian rhythms . The clocks that time circadian rhythms are in the brain, calibrated by the sun via the visual system, and they profoundly infl uence our health and well-being. THE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM Sometimes the forest is more interesting than the trees. Similarly, we are often less concerned with the activities of single neurons than with understanding the activity of a large population of neurons. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a measurement of electrical activity from the surface of the scalp that enables us to glimpse the generaized activity of the cerebral cortex. The roots of the EEG lie in work done by English physiologist Richard Caton in 1875. Caton made electrcal recordings from the surface of dog and rabbit brains using a primtive device sensitive to voltage. The human EEG was fi rst described by Austrian psychiatrist Hans Berger in 1929, who observed that waking and sleeping EEGs are distinctly different. Figure 19.1 shows one of his fi rst published records, taken from the head of his 15-year-old son, Klaus. Today, the EEG is used primarily to help diagnose certain nerological conditions, especially the seizures of epilepsy, and for research purposes, notably to study the stages of sleep and cognitive processes during wakefulness",

EEG 10 Hz time signal 647 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP Recording Brain Waves Recording an EEG is relatively simple. The method is usually nonivasive and is painless. Countless people have slept through entire nights wearing EEG electrodes in the comfort of sleep research laboratories (Figure 19.2). The electrodes are wires taped to the scalp, along with coductive paste to ensure a low-resistance connection. Figure 19.3 shows a common EEG confi guration, in which some two dozen electrodes are fi xed to standard positions on the head and connected to banks of amplfi ers and recording devices. Small voltage fl uctuations, usually a few tens of microvolts ( V) in amplitude, are measured between selected pairs of electrodes. Different regions of the brain—anterior and posterior, left and right—can be examined by selecting the appropriate electrode pairs. The typical EEG record is a set of many simultaneous squiggles, indicating voltage changes between pairs of electrodes. What part of the nervous system generates the fl uctuations and oscilltions of an EEG? For the most part, an EEG measures voltages generated by the currents that fl ow during synaptic excitation of the dendrites of many pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex, which lies right under the skull and makes up most of the brain’s mass. But the electrical contribtion of any single cortical neuron is exceedingly small, and the signal must penetrate several layers of non-neural tissue, including the meninges, fl uid, bones of the skull, and skin, to reach the electrodes (Figure 19.4). Therefore, it takes many thousands of underlying neurons, activated tgether, to generate an EEG signal big enough to be measured at all. This has an interesting consequence: The amplitude of the EEG sinal strongly depends, in part, on how synchronous is the activity of the underlying neurons",

When a group of cells is excited simultaneously, the tiny signals sum to generate one larger surface signal. However, when each cell receives the same amount of excitation but the excitations are spread out in time, the summed signals are meager and irregular (Figure 19.5). Notice that in this case, the number of activated cells and the total amount of excitation may not have changed, only the timing of the activity. If synchronous excitation of this group of cells is repeated again and again, the resulting EEG will consist of large, rhythmic waves.

Recall from physics that whenever electrical current fl ows, a magnetic fi eld is generated according to the “right hand rule” (hold up your right hand loosely; if your thumb points in the direction of electrical current fl ow, the rest of your curling fi ngers indicate the direction of the magnetic fi eld). It stands to reason that when neurons generate currents, as in Figure 19.4, they should also produce a magnetic fi eld. But the magnetic fi eld they generate is minuscule. Even the strongest brain activity, with many synchronously active neurons contributing, produces a fi eld strength just one billionth that of the manetic fi eld generated by the Earth, nearby power lines, and the movement of distant metal objects such as elevators and cars. Detecting the brain’s infi nitesimal magnetic signals in the midst of those relatively immense sources of environmental magnetic “noise” is analogous to listening for the footsteps of a mouse in the middle of a rock concert! It requires a spcially screened room to shield out the magnetic noise and a large, expesive instrument with highly sensitive magnetic detectors that are cooled with liquid helium to –269°C (Figure 19.6). The capabilities of MEG complement those of other methods that measure brain function. MEG is much better than EEG at localizing the sources of neural activity in the brain, particularly those deep below the surface.

Positive current flows into the dendrite, leaving a slight negatiity in the extracellular fluid. Current spreads down the dendrite and escapes from its deeper parts, leaving the fluid slightly positive at those sites. The EEG electrode (referred to a second electrode some distance away) measures this patern through thick tissue layers. Only if thousands of cells contribute their small voltage is the signal large enough to reach the scalp surface.

This isn’t the puzzle I set out to solve at the start of my career. My analytic nature led me to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics at Boston University. I intended to study the mathematics of chaos, but as with many careers my path diverged unexpectedly. A year into my graduate study, mathematician Nancy Kopell established the Center for BioDynamics, catalyzing growing interest in the applictions of dynamical systems theory to the study of biological phenomena, including neuroscience. After attending a few neuroscience lectures, I knew this was a puzzle I wanted to help solve. To my good fortune, Nancy took me on as a stdent. I began using mathematics to study rhythmic activity in simplifi ed representations of neural circuits, such as the cetral pattern-generating network that regulates crayfi sh swiming. By the time I fi nished my mathematics Ph.D., I was passionate about neuroscience. I knew I wanted to apply my knowledge to understand human brain dynamics. Little did I know just how many pieces are in that puzzle! For the next decade, I studied human brain rhythms using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in the brain-imaging center at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). At MGH, my path of discovery was again shaped by the gift of fantastic mentors and colleagues. The fi rst is my now close colleague, neurophysiologist Chris Moore, who was himself a postdoctoral fellow at the time",

    "chunk_text": ". The fi rst is my now close colleague, neurophysiologist Chris Moore, who was himself a postdoctoral fellow at the time. Chris enlightened me to the nuances of neuroscience and to the idea that the somatosensory system was the “ideal system to study” because of its puzzle-like topographical representation of the body, the homunculus (see Figure 12.19). With MEG we began studying tactile perception, such as the detection of light taps to the fi ngertips, in humans. Chris’s notion that this system was “ideal” was fortuitous, as was revealed in a surprising way through the mentorship of physicist Matti Hämäläinen, director of the MEG center. Matti taught me the ins and outs of MEG data collection and, importantly, the electromagnetic physics underlying these brain signals. I learned that the intracellular curents within the long, aligned dendrites of pyramidal neurons are the primary generators of the recorded magnetic fi eld signals. Further, the pyramidal neurons in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) are “ideally” oriented to produce strong MEG signals during fi nger taps that can be reliably localized to the hand representtion in S1. This enabled us to do careful studies of the neural generators of brain rhythms. P A T H O F D I S C O V E R Y BOX 19.1 The Puzzle of Brain Rhythms positron emission tomography (PET) (see Box 7.3). MEG cannot provide the spatially detailed images of fMRI, however. Another important distinction is that EEG and MEG directly measure the activity of neurons, whereas fMRI and PET detect changes in blood fl ow or metabolism, which are controlled in part by neuronal activity but which may also be infl uenced by other physological factors. MEG is currently being used in experimental studies of the human brain and its cognitive functions and as an aid in the diagnosis of epilepsy and language disorders (Box 19.1)",

EEG Rhythms EEG rhythms vary dramatically and often correlate with particular states of behavior (such as level of attentiveness, sleeping, or waking) and pathoogy (seizures or coma). Figure 19.7 shows part of a normal EEG. The brain can generate rhythms that are as slow as about 0.05 Hz and as fast as 500 Hz or more. The main EEG rhythms are categorized by their frequency range, and each range is named after a Greek letter. Delta rhythms are slow, less than 4 Hz, are often large in amplitude, and are a hallmark of deep sleep. Theta rhythms are 4–7 Hz and can occur during both sleeping and waking states. Alpha rhythms are about 8–13 Hz, are largest over the occipital cortex, and are associated with quiet, waking states; Mu rhythms are similar in frequency to alpha rhythms but are largest over the motor 651 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP As with all MEG (and EEG) recordings, the dominant activities from S1 are low-frequency, large-amplitude rhythms, including the beta rhythms of 15–29 Hz. We discovered that when a subject directs her attention to her fi nger before it is tapped, the beta rhythms in the hand area of S1 decrease compared to when her attention is directed elsewhere. Attention and rduced beta rhythms correlated with an increase in the subject’s ability to feel a light tap. Our results were similar to previous fi ndings in the visual cortex, suggesting that beta rhythms may signal inhibitory processes in sensory areas of cortex. But why? What is it about these rhythms, if anything, that links them to decreased perception? And why, in conditions like Parkinson’s disease, are beta rhythms over-expressed in motor cortex with a corresponding decrease in motor actions? To address this piece of the puzzle, I turned to my mathematics roots and began constructing a computational neural model to study the origins of these rhythms",

However, after much exploration using simplifi ed mathematical representtions of neural circuits (e.g., collapsing the activity of an etire neuron to a single point), I realized these models simply could not reproduce signals that resembled the recordings. Next, I drew on the pioneering work of Yoshio Okada, who combined experimental and mathematical modeling to uderstand MEG signals from pyramidal neurons. Equipped with my new knowledge of the biophysics underlying MEG, I constructed more complex models that included details of the structure and physiology of pyramidal neurons and other cortical neuron types. This endeavor spanned several years that also included the birth of the fi rst of my three children. To my delight, the detailed model yielded novel and nointuitive predictions about rhythms. Specifi cally, it predicted that beta rhythms emerge from the integration of two sets of synaptic inputs that are roughly synchronous and that excite different parts of pyramidal cell dendrites. These inputs drive alternating electrical currents up and down within the dendrites to reproduce rhythms remarkably consistent with recordings. The model not only accounted for many features of the MEG rhythms in S1 but also suggested how these rhythms infl uence sensory processing. I subsequently tested these secondary predictions with the MEG data, and to my surprise they were confi rmed! This discovery was thrilling since the mathematical model was now predicting what the data from new experiments would look like. Finally, pieces of the puzzle were fi tting together! The close agreement between the model’s output and the recorded human data gives us confi dence in the model’s predictions about how neurons generate beta rhythms.

An interesting feature of EEG rhythms is that their chaacteristics are remarkably similar across mammalian brains from mice to humans, despite 17,000-fold differences in brain mass (Figure 19.8)",

In general, high-frequency, low-amplitude rhythms are associated with alertness and waking, or the dreaming stages of sleep. Low-frequency, high-amplitude rhythms are asociated with nondreaming sleep states, certain drugged states, or the pathological condition of coma. This is logical because when the cortex is most actively engaged in processing information, whether generated by sensory input or by internal processes, the activity level of cortical nerons is relatively high but also relatively unsynchronized. In other words, each neuron, or a very small group of neurons, is vigorously involved in a slightly different aspect of a complex cognitive task; it fi res rapidly but not quite simultaneously with most of its neighbors. This leads to low synchrony, so EEG amplitude is low, and gamma and beta rhythms domnate. In contrast, during deep sleep, cortical neurons are not engaged in information processing, and large numbers of them are phasically excited by a common, slow, rhythmic input. In this case, synchrony is high, so EEG amplitude is high. Mechanisms and Meanings of Brain Rhythms Electrical rhythms abound in the cerebral cortex. But how are they geerated, and what functions, if any, do they perform? Let’s take a look at each of these questions. The Generation of Synchronous Rhythms",

The activity of a large set of neurons will produce synchronized oscillations in one of two fundamental ways: (1) They may all take their cues from a central clock, or pacemaker , or (2) they may share or distribute the timing function among themselves by mutually exciting or inhibiting one another. The fi rst mechanism is analogous to a band with a leader, with each musician playing in strict time to the beat of the leader’s baton (Figure 19.9a). The second mechnism is more subtle because the timing arises from the collective behavior of the cortical neurons themselves. Musically, it is more like a jam session (Figure 19.9b). The concept of shared synchronous rhythm can be easily demonstrated by a group of people, even nonmusical ones. Simply tell them to begin clapping, but give them no instructions about how fast to clap or whose beat to follow. Almost immediately they will all be clapping in synchrony! How? By listening and watching each other, they will adjust their claping rates to match. A key factor is person-to-person interaction; in a network of neurons, these interactions occur via synaptic connections. People naturally tend to clap within a narrow range of frequencies, so they don’t have to adjust their timing very far in order to clap in sychrony. Likewise, some neurons may fi re at certain frequencies much more than others. This kind of collective, organized behavior can geneate rhythms of impressive dimensions, which can move in space and time. Have you ever been part of a human wave in the stands of a sold-out football stadium? Many different circuits of neurons can generate rhythmic activity. A very simple model oscillator, consisting of just one excitatory and one inhibitory neuron, is shown in Figure 19.10",

Most real neural oscillators include far more neurons but similar basic features: a source of constant excitatory drive, feedback connections, and synaptic excitation and inhibition. Within the mammalian brain, rhythmic, synchronous activity is usally coordinated by a combination of the pacemaker and collective metods. For example, the thalamus, with its massive input to all of the (a) (b) ▲ FIGURE 19.9 Two mechanisms of synchronous rhythms. Synchronous rhythms can (a) be led by a pacemaker or (b) arise from the collective behavior of all participants. 654 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR cortex, can act as a powerful pacemaker. Under certain conditions, thlamic neurons can generate very rhythmic action potential discharges (Figure 19.11). But how do thalamic neurons oscillate? Some thalamic cells have a particular set of voltage-gated ion channels that allow each cell to generate very rhythmic, self-sustaining discharge patterns even when there is no external input to the cell. The rhythmic activity of each thalamic pacemaker neuron then becomes synchronized with many other thalamic cells via a hand-clapping kind of collective interaction. Synaptic connections between excitatory and inhibitory thalamic nerons force each individual neuron to conform to the rhythm of the group. These coordinated rhythms are then passed to the cortex by the thalmocortical axons, which excite cortical neurons. In this way, a relatively small group of centralized thalamic cells (acting as the band leader) can compel a much larger group of cortical cells (acting as the band) to march to the thalamic beat (Figure 19.12). Some rhythms of the cerebral cortex do not depend on a thalamic pacemaker but rely instead on the collective, cooperative interactions of cortical neurons themselves",

    "chunk_text": ". Ideas abound, but defi nitive evidence is scarce. One hypothesis for sleep-related rhythms is that they are the brain’s way of disconnecting the cortex from sensory input. When you are awake, the thalamus allows sensory information to pass through it and be relayed up to the cortex. When you are asleep, thalamic neurons enter a self-generated rhythmic state that prevents oganized sensory information from being relayed to the cortex. While this idea has intuitive appeal (most people do prefer to sleep in a dark, quiet environment), it does not explain why rhythms are necessary. Why not just steadily inhibit the thalamus and allow the cortex to rest quietly? A function for fast rhythms in the awake cortex has also been prposed. One scheme for understanding visual perception takes advantage of the fact that cortical neurons responding to the same object are sychronously active. Walter Freeman, a neurobiologist at the University of California, Berkeley, pioneered the idea that neural rhythms are used to coordinate activity between regions of the nervous system. Both sensory and motor systems of the awake brain often generate bursts of synchrnous neural activity that give rise to EEG gamma rhythms (30–90 Hz). By momentarily synchronizing the fast oscillations generated by diferent regions of cortex, perhaps the brain binds together various neural components into a single perceptual construction. For example, when you are trying to catch a basketball, different groups of neurons that simutaneously respond to the specifi c shape, color, movement, distance, and even the signifi cance of the basketball tend to oscillate synchronously. The fact that the oscillations of these scattered groups of cells (those that together encode “basketballness”) are highly synchronous would somhow tag them as a meaningful group, distinct from other nearby neurons, thereby unifying the disjointed neural pieces of the “basketball puzzle.” The evidence for this idea is indirect, far from proven, and understanably controversial",

    "chunk_text": ". For now, the functions of rhythms in the cerebral cortex are largely a mystery. One plausible hypothesis is that most rhythms have no direct function. Instead, they may be intriguing but unimportant by-products of the tendency for brain circuits to be strongly interconnected, with various forms of excitatory feedback. When something excites itself, whether it is an audio amplifi er or the human stadium wave, it often leads to instbility or oscillation. Feedback circuits are essential for the cortex to do all the marvelous things it does for us. Oscillations may be the unavoiable consequence of so much feedback circuitry, unwanted but tolerated by necessity. Even if they don’t have a function, however, EEG rhythms provide us with a convenient window on the functional states of the brain. The Seizures of Epilepsy Seizures, the most extreme form of synchronous brain activity, are always a sign of pathology. A generalized seizure involves the entire cerebral cortex of both hemispheres. A partial seizure involves only a circuscribed area of the cortex. In both cases, the neurons within the affected areas fi re with a synchrony that never occurs during normal behavior. As a consequence, seizures are usually accompanied by very large EEG patterns. The cerebral cortex, probably because of its extensive feedback circuitry, is never far from the runaway excitation we know as a seizure. Isolated seizures are not uncommon during a lifetime, and 7–10% of peCortex Thalamus Output pathways Afferent pathways ▲ FIGURE 19.12 Rhythms in the thalamus drive rhythms in the cerebral cortex.

About 0.7% of people worldwide (50 million) have epilepsy. Epilepsy is more common in developing countries, particularly in rural areas, presumably because of higher rates of untreated childhood epilepsy, infections, and poor prand postnatal care. The diagnosis of epilepsy occurs most often in young children and among the elderly (Figure 19.13). Childhood eplepsy is usually congenital, caused by genes or a disease or abnormality present at birth, whereas the elderly tend to acquire epilepsy as a consquence of conditions such as stroke, tumors, or Alzheimer’s disease. Epilepsy is more a symptom of disease than a disease itself. Its causes can sometimes be identifi ed, including tumors, trauma, genetics, metbolic dysfunction, infection, and vascular disease, but in many cases, the cause of epilepsy is not known. Different types of seizures have different underlying mechanisms. Some forms of epilepsy show a genetic prediposition, and many of the genes responsible have been identifi ed. These genes code for a diverse array of proteins, including ion channels, tranporters, receptors, and signaling molecules. Several mutations of genes that encode for sodium channel proteins, for example, have been linked to rare familial forms of epilepsy. These mutated sodium channels tend to stay open a bit longer than normal, allowing more sodium current to enter the neurons and thus making neurons hyperexcitable. Another group of mutations that lead to epilepsy impair synaptic inhibition medated by GABA by affecting its receptors, enzymes critical for its synthesis or transport, or proteins involved in its release. Research suggests that some seizures refl ect an upset of the delicate balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition in the brain. Other seizures may be due to excessively strong or dense excitatory interconnections",

The withdrawal of chronic depressant drugs, such as alcohol or barbiturates, may also trigger seizures. A variety of drugs are useful for the therapeutic suppression of seizures, and these anticonvusants tend to counter excitability in various ways. For example, some act by prolonging the inhibitory actions of GABA (e.g., barbiturates and bezodiazepines [see Figure 6.22]), while others decrease the tendency for certain neurons to fi re action potentials at a high frequency (e.g., phnytoin and carbamazepine).

We have only limited control over the decision; we can postpone sleep for a while, but eventually it overwhelms us. We spend about one-third of our lives sleeping, and onquarter of that time in a state of active dreaming. Sleep may be universal among higher vertebrates and perhaps among all animals. Research suggests that even the fruit fl y, Drosophila , sleeps. Prolonged sleep deprivation is devastating to proper functioning, at least temporarily, and in some animals (such as rats and cockroaches, though probably not in humans), it may even cause death. Sleep is essential to our lives, almost as important as eating and breathing. But why do we sleep? What purpose does it serve? Despite many years of research, the joke remains that the only thing we are sure of is that sleep overcomes sleepiness. But one of the wonderful things about science is that the lack of consensus inspires a fl ourishing of theories, and sleep research is no exception. We can still describe what we cannot explain, and sleep has been richly studied. Let’s begin with a defi nition: Sleep is a readily reversible state of reduced responsiveness to, and interaction with, the environment. (Coma and general anesthesia are not readily reversible and do not qualify as sleep.) In the sections that follow, we discuss the phenomenology and neural mechanisms of sleep and dreaming. The Functional States of the Brain During a normal day, you experience two very different and noticeable types of behavior: waking and sleeping. It is much less obvious that your sleep also has very distinct phases or states.

(Non-REM sleep is also sometimes called slow-wave sleep because of its domination by large, slow EEG rhythms.) These fudamental behavioral states—awake, non-REM sleep, and REM sleep— are produced by three distinct states of brain function (Table 19.1). Each behavioral state is also accompanied by large shifts in body function. Non-REM sleep seems to be a period for rest. Muscle tension througout the body is reduced, and movement is minimal. It is important to realize that the body is capable of movement during non-REM sleep but S L E E P 659 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP only rarely does the brain command it to move, usually to briefl y adjust the body’s position. The temperature and energy consumption of the body are lowered. Because of an increase in activity of the parasympathetic division of the ANS, heart rate, respiration, and kidney function all slow down, and digestive processes speed up. During non-REM sleep, the brain also seems to rest. Its rate of energy use, and the general fi ring rates of its neurons, is at their lowest point of the day. The slow, large-amplitude EEG rhythms indicate that the neurons of the cortex are oscillating in relatively high synchrony, and eperiments suggest that most sensory input cannot even reach the cortex. While there is no way to know for certain what people are thinking when they are asleep, studies indicate that mental processes also hit their daily low during the non-REM state. When awakened, people often recall noting, or only brief, fragmentary, plausible thoughts with few visual images. Detailed, entertaining, irrational dreams are rare, although not absent, during non-REM sleep. William Dement, a pioneering sleep researcher at Stanford University, characterizes non-REM sleep as an idling brain in a movable body . In contrast, Dement calls REM sleep an active, hallucinating brain in a paralyzed body. REM sleep is dreaming sleep",

Although the REM period accounts for only a small part of our sleep time, it is the part most researchers get excited about (and this is the state that most excites the brain), perhaps because dreams are so intriguing and enigmatic. If you awaken someone during REM sleep, as Dement, Eugene Aserinsky, and Nathaniel Kleitman fi rst did in the mid-1950s, the person will likely report visually detailed, lifelike episodes, often with bizarre story lines— the kinds of dreams we love to talk about and try to interpret. The physiology of REM sleep is also bizarre. The EEG looks almost indistinguishable from that of an active, waking brain, with fast, lovoltage fl uctuations. This is why REM sleep is sometimes referred to as paradoxical sleep . In fact, the oxygen consumption of the brain (a mesure of its energy use) is higher in REM sleep than when the brain is awake and concentrating on diffi cult mathematical problems. The pralysis that occurs during REM sleep is caused by an almost total loss of skeletal muscle tone or atonia . Most of the body is actually incapable of moving! Respiratory muscles do continue to function but just barely. The muscles controlling eye movement and the tiny muscles of the inner ear are the exceptions; these are strikingly active. With lids closed, the eyes occasionally dart rapidly back and forth. These bursts of rapid eye movment are the best predictors of vivid dreaming, and at least 90% of people awakened during or after them report dreams. Physiological control systems are dominated by sympathetic activity during REM sleep. Inexplicably, the body’s temperature control system simply quits, and core temperature begins to drift downward.

Overall, during REM sleep, the brain seems to be doing everything except resting. The Sleep Cycle Even a good night’s sleep is not a steady, unbroken journey. It normally begins with a period of non-REM sleep. Figure 19.15 shows that a typical full night of sleep includes a regular cycling of eye movements, physiologcal functions, and penile erections through non-REM and REM periods. It is obvious that sleep takes the brain through a repetitive roller coaster ride of activity, and sometimes the ride is pretty wild (Box 19.2). Roughly 75% of total sleep time is spent in non-REM and 25% in REM, with priodic cycles between these states throughout the night. Non-REM sleep is generally divided into four distinct stages.

These cycles are examples of ultradian rhythms , which have faster priods than circadian rhythms. EEG rhythms during the stages of sleep are shown in Figure 19.16. An average, healthy adult becomes drowsy and begins to sleep, fi rst enteing stage 1 non-REM sleep. Stage 1 is transitional sleep, when the EEG alpha rhythms of relaxed waking become less regular and wane, and the eyes make slow, rolling movements. Stage 1 is fl eeting, usually lasting only a few minutes. It is also the lightest stage of sleep, meaning that we are most easily awakened. Stage 2 is slightly deeper and may last 5–15 minutes. Its characteristics include the occasional 8–14 Hz oscilation of the EEG called the sleep spindle , which is generated by a thlamic pacemaker (see Figure 19.12). In addition, a high-amplitude sharp wave called the K complex is sometimes observed. Eye movements almost cease. Next follows stage 3, and the EEG begins large-amplitude, slow delta rhythms. Eye and body movements are few. Stage 4 is the deepest stage of sleep, with large EEG rhythms of 2 Hz or less. During the fi rst cycle of sleep, stage 4 may persist for 20–40 minutes. Then sleep begins to lighten again, ascends through stage 3 to stage 2 for 10–15 minutes, and suddenly enters a brief period of REM sleep, with its fast EEG beta and gamma rhythms and sharp, frequent eye movements",

    "chunk_text": ". As the night progresses, there is a general reduction in the duration of non-REM sleep, particularly in stages 3 and 4, and an increase in the REM periods. Half of the night’s REM sleep occurs during its last third, and the longest REM periods may last 30–50 minutes. Still, there seems to be an obligatory refractory period of about 30 minutes between periods of REM; in other words, each REM period is followed by at least 30 miutes of non-REM sleep before the next REM period can begin. O F S P E C I A L I N T E R E S T Walking, Talking, and Screaming in Your Sleep S leep is not always serene and stationary. Talking, waling, and screaming are common, usually occurring during non-REM sleep. If this seems surprising, remember that REM sleep is accompanied by almost total body paralysis. You would therefore be incapable of walking or talking during REM sleep, even if your dream “urged” you to do it. Sleepwalking, or somnambulism , peaks at about age 11. Although 40% of us were sleepwalkers as children, few of us sleepwalk as adults. Sleepwalking usually occurs during the fi rst stage 4 non-REM period of the night. A full-blown sleewalking incident involves open eyes and movement around the room, the house, or even outside, with enough awareness to avoid objects and climb stairs. Cognitive functioning and judgment are severely impaired. It is often diffi cult to awaken sleepwalkers because they are in deep, slow-wave sleep. The best treatment is a guiding hand back to bed. Sleepwalkers usually have no memory of the incident the next morning. Almost everyone practices sleep talking, somniloquy , now and then. Unfortunately, sleeping speech is often so garbled or nonsensical that a curious listener is disappointed by its emptiness. More dramatic are sleep terrors, also known a s night terors, which are most common in children 5–7 years old. A girl screams in the middle of the night. Her parents rush to her bedside, frantic to know what has alarmed her",

The girl cries inconsolably, unable to explain her horrifying experence. After 10 agonizing minutes of shrieking and fl ailing, she fi nally sleeps quietly, leaving the parents shaken and baffl ed. The next morning she is bright and cheerful, with no recolletion of the night’s misadventure. Sleep terrors are distinctly different from nightmares, which are vivid, complex dreams, outwardly quiet, that occur during REM sleep. By contrast, sleep terrors begin in stage 3 or 4 of non-REM sleep, and the experience is not dreamlike but a feeling of uncontrolable panic, accompanied by greatly increased heart rate and blood pressure. They usually pass with adolescence and are not a symptom of a psychiatric disorder. BOX 19.2 662 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR What is a normal night’s sleep? Your mother may have insisted that you need a “good 8 hours” of sleep each night. Research suggests that normal requirements vary widely among adults, from about 5–10 hours per night. The average length is about 7.5 hours, and the sleep duration of about 68% of young adults is between 6.5 and 8.5 hours. Teenagers may fi nd it especially challenging to get enough sleep. Research by Mary Carskadon at Brown University suggests that sleep requirements do not decrease between preadolescence and early teen years, but changes in circadian timing mechanisms make it progressively harder for teenagers to fall asleep early in the evening. This process often coincides with the move to high school and an earlier start of the school day. As a result, many students are chronically sleep-deprived, which is an unhealthy condition. Too little sleep can reduce cognitive, emotional, and physical well-being. What is the proper length of sleep time for you? The best measure of successful sleep is the quality of your time awake. You need a certain amount of sleep in order to maintain a reasonable level of alertness",

Too much daytime sleepiness can be more than annoying; it can be dangeous if it interferes with driving, for example. Because of the wide varitions among individuals, you must decide for yourself how much sleep you need. Why Do We Sleep? All mammals, birds, and reptiles appear to sleep, although only mamals and some birds have a REM phase. Sleep time varies widely, from about 18 hours a day in bats and opossums to about 3 hours a day in horses and giraffes.

Whatever the function, there is good reason to believe sleep is mainly for the brain. Cognitive impairment is the most immediate and obvious consequence of sleep deprivation. A restful 8 hours in bed without sleep might allow your body to recover from physical exertion, but you would not be at your best mentally the next day. Some animals apparently have more reason not to sleep than others. Imagine living your entire life in deep or turbulent water, yet needing to breathe air every minute or so. Even a quick nap would be awkward, at best. This is precisely the situation with dolphins and whales, yet they sleep about as much as humans do. Remarkably, bottlenose dolphins sleep with only one cerebral hemisphere at a time: about 2 hours of noREM sleep on just one side, then 1 hour awake on both sides, 2 hours of non-REM sleep on the other side, and so on, for a total of about 12 hours per night (Figure 19.17)",

    "chunk_text": ". (This gives new meaning to the phrase “being half asleep.”) There is no evidence that dolphins or whales have REM sleep. Another unusual sleep strategy is used by the blind Indus River dolphin of Pakistan. This dolphin uses sonar to navigate through muddy, turbid, sweeping currents, and during monsoon season it must never stop swimming or it will come to grief on the rocks and debris of the fl ooded etuary it calls home. Still, the Indus River dolphin seems to sleep, snatcing “microsleeps” 4–6 seconds long while continuing to swim slowly. Its many microsleeps add up to about 7 hours in a 24-hour day. Dolphins have evolved extraordinary sleep mechanisms that adapt them to a demanding environment. But the fact that dolphins are not sleepless reinforces our question: What is so important about sleeping? No single theory of the function of sleep is widely accepted, but the most reasonable ideas fall into two categories: theories of restoration and theories of adaptation . The fi rst category is a commonsense explanation: We sleep in order to rest and recover and to prepare to be awake again. The second category is less obvious: We sleep to keep us out of trouble, to hide from predators when we are most vulnerable or from other harmful features of the environment, or to conserve energy. If sleep is restorative, what is it restoring? Quiet rest is certainly not a substitute for sleep. Sleeping does something more than simple resting. Prolonged sleep deprivation can lead to serious physical and behavioral problems (Box 19.3).

Sleep does prepare us to be effectively awake again. But does sleep renew us in the same way that eating and drinking do, by replacing essential substances, or the way the healing of a wound repairs damaged tissues? For the most part, evidence indicates that sleep is not a time of increased tissue rpair for the body. However, it is possible that brain regions such as the cerebral cortex can achieve some form of essential “rest” only during noREM sleep. Adaptation theories of sleep take many forms. Some large animals eat small animals; a stroll in the moonlight is far too risky for a squirrel liing in owl and fox territory. The squirrel’s best strategy may be to stay safely tucked away in an underground burrow during the night, and sleep is a good way to enforce such isolation. At the same time, sleep may be an adaptation for conserving energy. While sleeping, the body does only just enough work to stay alive, core temperature drops, temperature regultion is depressed, and the rate of calories burned is kept low. Functions of Dreaming and REM Sleep In many ancient cultures, people believed that dreams were a window on some higher world and a source of information, guidance, power, or enlightenment. Perhaps they were right, but the collective wisdom of the past does not agree on exactly how to interpret the meaning of dreams. Today we must take a step backward and fi rst ask whether dreams even have meaning. Dreams are diffi cult to study. Obviously, we can’t directly observe the dreams of someone else, and even the dreamer has access to them only after he or she has awakened and perhaps forgotten or ditorted the experience",

Modern explanations of dreaming lean heavily on O F S P E C I A L I N T E R E S T The Longest All-Nighter I n 1963, Randy Gardner was a 17-year-old high school student with an ambitious idea for a San Diego Science Fair project. On December 28 he awoke at 6 a.m. to begin. When he fi nished 11 days (264 hours) later, he had broken the world’s record for nonstop wakefulness, under the cotinuous scrutiny of two friends and, during the last 5 days, fascinated sleep researchers. He had used no drugs, not even caffeine. The experience was not pleasant. After 2 days without sleep, Randy became irritable and nauseated, had trouble remembering, and could not even watch television. By the fourth day, he had mild delusions and overwhelming fatigue, and by the seventh day, he had tremors, his speech was slurred, and his EEG no longer showed alpha rhythms. At times he was paranoid or hallucinating. Fortunately, he did not become psychotic, despite the predictions of some experts. On the contrary, on his last awake night, he beat one of his better rested observers at an arcade baseball game, and he gave a coherent account of himself at a ntional press conference. When he fi nally went to bed, he slept for almost 15 hours straight, then stayed awake 23 hours to wait for nightfall, and slept for another 10.5 hours. After the fi rst sleep, his symtoms had mostly disappeared, and within a week, he was sleeping and behaving normally. One of the most interesting things about Randy’s ordeal is that there were no lasting harmful effects. The same is not true for some animals deprived of sleep. If rats are kept awake for long periods, they progressively lose weight while consuing much more food, become weak, accumulate stomach ulcers and internal hemorrhages, and even die",

If rats are kept awake for long periods, they progressively lose weight while consuing much more food, become weak, accumulate stomach ulcers and internal hemorrhages, and even die. They seem to suffer from an impairment of their ability to regulate body temperature and metabolic needs. Total sleep deprivation is not necessary. Prolonged REM sleep loss alone is detrimetal. These results may imply that sleep provides something physiologically essential. BOX 19.3 665 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP studies of REM sleep rather than dreaming because the phenomena of REM can be objectively measured. But it is important to remember that the two are not synonymous. Some dreams can occur outside of REM sleep, and REM sleep has many peculiar features that have nothing to do with dreaming. Do we need to dream? No one knows, but the body does seem to crave REM sleep. It is possible to deprive sleepers of REM sleep specifi cally by waking them every time they enter the REM state; when they fall asleep a minute or two later, it is inevitably into a non-REM state, and they can accumulate an entire night of relatively pure non-REM sleep. As Dement fi rst observed, after several days of this annoying treatment, sleepers attempt to enter the REM state much more frequently than nomal. When they are fi nally allowed to sleep undisturbed, they experience REM rebound and spend more time in REM proportional to the duration of their deprivation. Most studies have found that REM deprivation does not cause any major psychological harm during the daytime. Again, it is important not to interpret REM deprivation as dream deprivation, since during REM deprivation, dreams may continue to occur during sleep onset and during non-REM periods. Sigmund Freud suggested many functions for dreams. For Freud, dreams were disguised wish fulfi llment, an unconscious way for us to express our sexual and aggressive fantasies, which are forbidden while we are awake.

    "chunk_text": ". Bad dreams might help us conquer the anxiety-provoking events of life. Recent theories of dreaming are more biologically based. Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley of Harvard University propose an “activation–synthesis hypothesis,” which explicitly rejects freudian, pschological interpretations. Instead, dreams, or at least some of their bzarre features, are seen as the associations and memories of the cerbral cortex that are elicited by the random discharges of the pons during REM sleep. Thus, the pontine neurons, via the thalamus, activate various areas of the cerebral cortex, elicit well-known images or emotions, and the cortex then tries to synthesize the disparate images into a sensible whole. Not surprisingly, the “synthesized” dream product may be quite bizarre and even nonsensical because it is triggered by the semirandom activity of the pons. Evidence for the activation–synthesis hypothesis is mixed. It does predict the weirdness of dreams and their correlation with REM sleep. But it does not explain how random activity can trigger the complex and fl uid stories that many dreams contain nor how it can evoke dreams that recur night after night. Many researchers have suggested that REM sleep, and perhaps dreams themselves, have an important role in memory. None of the evidence is defi nitive, but intriguing hints indicate that REM sleep somehow aids the integration or consolidation of memories. Depriving humans or rats of REM sleep can impair their ability to learn a variety of tasks. Some studies show an increase in the duration of REM sleep after an intense learning experience. In one study, Israeli neuroscientist Avi Karni and his colleagues trained people to identify the orientation of a small line in their peripheral visual fi eld. The task was made diffi cult by presenting the visual stimulus for a very short period of time. With repeated practice over days, people got much better at this task; surprisingly, their perfomance also improved between evening and morning, after a night’s sleep",

Karni found that if people were deprived of REM sleep, their learning of the task did not improve overnight. Depriving them of non-REM sleep, on the other hand, actually enhanced their performance. Karni hypothesizes that this kind of memory requires a period of time to strengthen and that REM sleep is particularly effective for this purpose. 666 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR You may have heard about sleep learning, the notion that you can study for an exam by simply listening to a tape of the material while you blisfully snooze away. Sounds like a student’s fantasy, right? Unfortunately, it is exactly that and no more. There is no scientifi c evidence for sleep learning, and careful studies have shown that the very few things rcalled the next morning were heard when the subjects briefl y woke up. In fact, sleep is a profoundly amnesic state. Most of our dreams, for example, seem to be lost forever. Although we dream profusely during each of the four or fi ve REM periods every night, we usually remember only the last dream before waking. Also, when we briefl y wake up to do something in the middle of the night, we have often forgotten the incident by morning. At this point you are probably confused about the functions of dreaing and REM sleep. So are we. Unfortunately, there is not enough evdence to support or dismiss any of the theories we have discussed. There are also many other creative and plausible ideas that we do not have the space to present here. Neural Mechanisms of Sleep Until the 1940s, it was generally believed that sleep was a passive prcess: Deprive the brain of sensory input, and it will fall asleep. However, when the sensory afferents to an animal’s brain are blocked, the animal continues to have cycles of waking and sleeping",

    "chunk_text": ". However, when the sensory afferents to an animal’s brain are blocked, the animal continues to have cycles of waking and sleeping. We now know that sleep is an active process that requires the participation of a variety of brain regions. As we saw in Chapter 15, wide expanses of the cortex are actally controlled by very small collections of neurons much deeper in the brain. These cells act like the switches or tuners of the forebrain, altering cortical excitability and gating the fl ow of sensory information into it. The full details of these control systems are complex and not fully understood. But we can summarize a few basic principles: 1. The neurons most critical to the control of sleeping and waking are part of the diffuse modulatory neurotransmitter systems (see Chapter 15, Figures 15.12 to 15.15). 2. The brain stem modulatory neurons using norepinephrine and sertonin fi re during waking and enhance the awake state; some neurons using acetylcholine enhance critical REM events, and other cholinergic neurons are active during waking. 3. The diffuse modulatory systems control the rhythmic behaviors of the thalamus, which in turn controls many EEG rhythms of the cerebral cortex; slow, sleep-related rhythms of the thalamus apparently block the fl ow of sensory information up to the cortex. 4. Sleep also involves activity in descending branches of the diffuse modulatory systems, such as the inhibition of motor neurons during dreaming. There are three basic kinds of evidence for the localization of sleep mechanisms in the brain. Lesion data reveal changes in function after a part of the brain is removed, results of stimulation experiments identify changes following the activation of a brain region, and recordings of neral activity determine the relationship between that activity and diffeent brain states.

Lesions in the brain stem of humans can cause sleep and coma, suggesting that the brain stem has neurons whose activity is essential to keeping us awake. Italian neurophysiologist Giuseppe Moruzzi and his colleagues, working 667 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP in the 1940s and 1950s, began to sort out the neurobiology of the brain stem’s control of waking and arousal. They found that lesions in the miline structures of the brain stem caused a state similar to non-REM sleep, but lesions in the lateral tegmentum, which interrupted ascending sesory inputs, did not. Conversely, electrical stimulation of the midline tementum of the midbrain, within the reticular formation, transformed the cortex from the slow, rhythmic EEGs of non-REM sleep to a more alert and aroused state with an EEG similar to that of waking. Moruzzi called this ill-defi ned region of stimulation the ascending reticular activating system (mentioned in Chapter 15). This area is now much better defi ned, anatomically and physiologically, and it is clear that Moruzzi’s stimultion was affecting many different sets of ascending modulatory systems. Several sets of neurons increase their fi ring rates in anticipation of awakening and during various forms of arousal. They include cells of the locus coeruleus, which contain norepinephrine, serotonin-containing cells of the raphe nuclei, acetylcholine-containing cells of the brain stem and basal forebrain, midbrain neurons that use histamine as a neurotranmitter, and neurons of the hypothalamus that use hypocretin (orexin) as a transmitter (Figure 19.18). Collectively, these neurons synapse directly on the entire thalamus, cerebral cortex, and many other brain regions. The general effects of their transmitters are a depolarization of neurons, an increase in their excitability, and a suppression of rhythmic forms of fi ring. These effects are most clearly seen in the relay neurons of the thalamus (Figure 19.19)",

Hypocretin (also known as orexin ; see Chapter 16) is a small peptide neurotransmitter expressed mainly by neurons whose cell bodies are in the lateral hypothalamus. The axons of hypocretin (orexin)-secreting neurons project widely in the brain, and they strongly excite cells of the cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, and histaminergic modulatory systems. When the peptide was fi rst discovered, researchers thought hypocretin (orexin) was involved specifi cally in feeding behavior (see Chapter 16), but it clearly has a more general role. The peptide also promotes wakefulness, inhibits REM sleep, facilitates neurons that ehance certain kinds of motor behavior, and is involved in the regulation of neuroendocrine and autonomic systems. The loss of hypocretin (orexin) neurons leads to a sleep disorder called narcolepsy (Box 19.4).

Falling asleep involves a prgression of changes over several minutes, culminating in the non-REM state. It is not entirely clear what initiates non-REM sleep, although cetain sleep-promoting factors contribute (as we will describe later), and there is a general decrease in the fi ring rates of most brain stem modultory neurons (those using NE, 5-HT, and ACh). Although most regions of the basal forebrain seem to promote alertness and arousal, a subset of its cholinergic neurons increases their fi ring rate with the onset of non-REM sleep and are silent during wakefulness. Early stages of non-REM sleep include the EEG sleep spindles, decribed earlier, which are generated in part by the inherent rhythmicity of thalamic neurons (see Figure 19.11). As non-REM sleep progresses, spindles disappear and are replaced by slow delta rhythms (less than 4 Hz). Delta rhythms may also be a product of thalamic cells, occurring when their membrane potentials become even more negative than duing spindle rhythms (and much more negative than during waking). Synchronization of activity during spindle or delta rhythms is due to neral interconnections within the thalamus and between the thalamus and cortex. Because of the strong, two-way excitatory connections between the thalamus and cortex, rhythmic activity in one is often strongly and widely projected upon the other. 669 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP Narcolepsy N arcolepsy is a bizarre and disabling disturbance of sleeing and waking. Despite the sound of the name, it is not a form of epilepsy. It can include some or all of the following manifestations. Excessive daytime sleepiness can be severe and often leads to unwanted “sleep attacks.” Cataplexy is a sudden muscular paralysis while consciousness is maintained. In the middle of a normal day, sufferers suddenly collapse into a state similar to REM sleep",

    "chunk_text": ". In the middle of a normal day, sufferers suddenly collapse into a state similar to REM sleep. Cataplexy is often brought on by strong emotional expression, such as laughter or tears, or by surprise or sexual arousal, and it usually lasts less than a minute. Sleep paralysis , a similar loss of muscle control, occurs during the transition between sleeping and waking. Sometimes occurring in the absence of narcolepsy, it can be very disconcerting; even though conscious, a person may be unable to move or speak for several minutes. Hypnagogic hallucinations are graphic dreams, often frightening, that can accompany sleep onset and may occur following sleep paralysis. Sometimes such dreams fl ow smoothly with real events that occurred just prior to falling asleep. EEG monitoring reveals a distinct difference between nacoleptic and normal sleep. A narcoleptic person goes directly from waking into a REM phase, whereas normal adult sleeers always enter a long period of non-REM sleep fi rst. Most narcolepsy symptoms might be interpreted as an abnormal intrusion of the characteristics of REM sleep into waking. The prevalence of narcolepsy varies widely, affecting about 1 in 1000–2000 people in the U.S. population but only 1 in 500,000 in Israel, for example. The typical age of onset is 12–16 years. The disorder has a genetic component, and a high percentage of narcoleptics have a particular form of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene. However, about 25% of the general population has the narcoleptic form of the HLA gene, yet the large majority do not develop narclepsy. Environmental factors may also play an important role. A recent study in China found that the onset of narcolepsy in children varies with the seasons and tends to be highest folowing winter-related respiratory infections. There was a paticularly sharp rise in cases of narcolepsy just after the H1N1 infl uenza pandemic in 2009–2010, followed by a decrease in the two years following",

    "chunk_text": ". There was a paticularly sharp rise in cases of narcolepsy just after the H1N1 infl uenza pandemic in 2009–2010, followed by a decrease in the two years following. Narcolepsy rates increased both in Europe, where many people were vaccinated against H1N1, and in China, where vaccines were not available. Narcolepsy occurs in goats, donkeys, ponies, and more than a dozen breeds of dogs. In 1999, Emmanuel Mignot, Seiji Nishino, and their research team at Stanford University found that canine narcolepsy is caused by a mutation of the gene for a hypocretin receptor. Also in 1999, Masashi Yanagisawa and his group at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center deleted the genes responsible for the petide neurotransmitter hypocretin in mice and found that the animals were narcoleptic. Basic animal research of this sort quickly inspired important studies of human narcolepsy. In 2000, two research teams discovered that the brains of human narcoleptics have about 10% or less of the nomal complement of hypocretin-containing neurons (Figure A). Their CSF has immeasurably low levels of hypocretin, whereas hypocretin is found at normal levels in nearly every other neurological disease. Human narcolepsy almost certainly results from the selective death of hypocretin-containing neurons in most cases. Unlike in some animal versions of the disease, hypocretin defi ciency is rarely caused by mutations of the hypocretin or hypocretin receptor genes. The reason hypocretin neurons die in narcoleptic patients is unknown, although there is strong evidence that some kind of autoimune process is involved. Fragments of viral proteins may mimic hypocretin, somehow priming immune cells to attack hypocretin-releasing cells. There is no cure for narcolepsy yet, and current treaments aim only to relieve the symptoms. Frequent naps, aphetamines, and a drug called modafi nil may help daytime sleepiness, while tricyclic antidepressant drugs (which have REM-suppressant effects) may reduce cataplexy and sleep paralysis",

REM is such a different state from non-REM that we would expect some clear neural distinctions. Many cortical areas are at least as active during REM sleep as they are during waking. For example, neurons of the motor cortex fi re rapidly and generate organized motor patterns that attempt to command the entire body but succeed only with a few muscles of the eye and inner ear and those essential for respration. The elaborate dreams of REM sleep certainly require the cerebral cortex. However, the cortex is not necessary for the production of REM sleep. The use of PET and fMRI imaging in the waking and sleeping human brain has provided fascinating glimpses of the activity patterns that ditinguish waking from REM and non-REM sleep. Figure 19.20a shows the difference in brain activity between REM sleep and waking. Some areas, including primary visual cortex, were about equally active in the two states. However, extrastriate cortical areas and portions of the limbic system were signifi cantly more active during REM sleep than waking. Conversely, regions of the frontal lobes were noticeably less active during REM. Figure 19.20b contrasts the brain activity in REM and non-REM sleep",

The primary visual cortex and a number of other areas are signifi - cantly less active during REM sleep, but extrastriate cortex is more active than it is in non-REM. These results paint an intriguing picture of what happens when we sleep. During REM, there is an explosion of extrastriate activity, presumably during the times when we dream. However, there is no corresponding activity increase in the primary visual cortex, suggesing that the extrastriate excitation is internally generated. The emotional component of dreams might derive from the heightened limbic activation. The low activity in the frontal lobe suggests that high-level integration or interpretation of the extrastriate visual information might not take place, leaving us with a buzz of uninterpreted visual imagery. The control of REM sleep, as with the other functional brain states, derives from diffuse modulatory systems in the core of the brain stem, particularly the pons.

However, there is a concurrent sharp increase in the fi ring rates of ACh-containing nerons in the pons, and some evidence suggests that cholinergic neurons induce REM sleep. It is probably the action of ACh during REM sleep that causes the thalamus and cortex to behave so much like they do in the waking state. Why don’t we act out our dreams? The same core brain stem systems that control the sleep processes of the forebrain also actively inhibit our spinal motor neurons, preventing the descending motor activity from epressing itself as actual movement. This is clearly an adaptive mechnism, protecting us from ourselves. In rare cases, usually elderly men, dreamers seem to act out their dreams; they have a hazardous condition known as REM sleep behavior disorder . These people often sustain rpeated injuries, and even their spouses have fallen victim to their noturnal fl ailings. One man dreamed he was in a football game and tackled his bedroom bureau. Another imagined he was defending his wife from attack, when in fact he was beating her in her bed. The basis for this REM disorder seems to be disruption of the brain stem systems that normally mediate REM atonia. Experimental lesions in certain parts of the pons can cause a similar condition in cats. During REM periods, they may seem to chase imaginary mice or investigate invisible intruders. Disorders of REM control mechanisms, caused by a defi ciency of hypocretin (orexin), also contribute to the problems of people with narcolepsy (see Box 19.4). Sleep-Promoting Factors. Sleep researchers have searched intensively for chemicals in the blood or cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) that promote or even cause sleep.

Adenosine is used by all cells to build some of the most basic molecules of life, including DNA, RNA, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Adenosine is also released by some nerons and glia and acts as a neuromodulator at synapses throughout the brain. It’s a substance that might appeal to the millions who drink cofee, tea, and cola. From ancient times, antagonists of adenosine receptors, such as caffeine and theophylline, have been used to keep people awake. Conversely, the administration of adenosine or its agonists increases sleep. Extracellular levels of natural brain adenosine are higher during waking than while sleeping. Levels progressively increase during prolonged waing periods and sleep deprivation, and they gradually decrease during sleep. Waking-related changes in adenosine levels occur not in the entire brain, but only in certain sleep-related regions. These two properties of adenosine—its sleep-promoting effect and the levels that track the need for sleep—strongly suggest it is an important sleep-promoting factor. 1 Firing rate 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Hours since sleep onset Non-REM REM REM-on cells REM-off cells 0 FIGURE 19.21 Control of the onset and offset of REM periods by brain stem neurons.

    "chunk_text": ". (Source: McCarley and Massaquoi, 1986, Fig. 4B.) 672 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR How might adenosine promote sleep? Adenosine has an inhibitory effect on the diffuse modulatory systems for ACh, NE, and 5-HT that tend to prmote wakefulness. This suggests that sleep may be the result of a moleclar chain reaction. Neural activity in the awake brain increases adenosine levels, thereby increasing the inhibition of neurons in the modulatory sytems associated with wakefulness. Enhanced suppression of the “wakeful” modulatory systems makes it more likely that the brain will fall into the slow-wave synchronous activity characteristic of non-REM sleep. After sleep begins, adenosine levels slowly fall, and activity in the modulatory systems gradually increases until we wake up to start the cycle anew. Another important sleep-promoting factor is nitric oxide (NO) . Recall that NO is a small, mobile, gaseous molecule that can diffuse easily across membranes and serves as a retrograde (postsynaptic to presynaptic) mesenger between certain neurons (see Chapter 6). The wake-promoting cholinergic neurons of the brain stem express particularly high levels of the synthesizing enzyme for NO. Brain NO levels are highest during waing, and they rise rapidly with sleep deprivation. How does NO promote sleep? Studies have shown that NO triggers the release of adenosine. As we have seen, adenosine promotes non-REM sleep by suppressing the activity of neurons that help to sustain waking. Sleepiness is one of the most familiar consequences of infectious dieases, such as the common cold and the fl u. There are direct links btween the immune response to infection and the regulation of sleep. In the 1970s, physiologist John Pappenheimer of Harvard University identifi ed a muramyl dipeptide in the spinal fl uid of sleep-deprived goats that facilitated non-REM sleep. Muramyl peptides are usually produced only by the cell walls of bacteria, not brain cells, and they also cause fever and stimulate immune cells of the blood",

It is not clear how they appear in CSF, but they may be synthesized by bacteria in the intestines. More recent research has implicated several cytokines , small signaling peptides involved in the immune system, in the regulation of sleep. One of them is interleukin-1 , which is synthesized in the brain by glia, and by macrophages, cells throughout the body that scavenge foreign material. Like adenosine and NO, interleukin-1 levels increase during waking, and in humans its levels peak just before the onset of sleep. Interleukin-1 promotes non-REM sleep even when the immune system has not been challenged. When given to humans, it induces fatigue and sleepiness. Interleukin-1 also stimulates the immune system. Another endogenous sleep-promoting substance is melatonin , a homone secreted by the pea-sized pineal body (see the appendix to Chapter 7). Melatonin is a derivative of the amino acid tryptophan. It has been called the “Dracula of hormones” because it is released only when the enviroment darkens—normally at night—and its release is inhibited by light. In humans, melatonin levels tend to rise around the time we become sleepy in the evening, peak in the early morning hours, and then fall to baseline levels by the time we awaken. Evidence suggests that melatonin helps initiate and maintain sleep, but its precise role in natural sleep–wake cycles is not clear. In recent years, melatonin has become popular as an over-the-counter sleep-promoting drug. Although it has shown some promise in treating the symptoms of jet lag and the insomnia that affects some older adults, the general effect of melatonin on improving sleep rmains debatable.

Methods from molecular neurobiology have also cotributed interesting facts. While the pieces do not all fi t together quite yet, it is clear that the behavioral states of sleeping and waking are different even at the molecular level. For example, in the macaque monkey, most areas of cerebral cortex show higher rates of protein synthesis in deep sleep than in light sleep. In rats, levels of cAMP in several brain areas have been found to be lower during sleeping than waking. Research has demonstrated that sleeping and waking are associated with differences in the expression of certain genes. Chiara Cirelli and Giulio Tononi, working at the Neurosciences Institute in San Diego and at the University of Wisconsin, have studied the expression of thousands of genes in rats that were awake or asleep. The vast majority of genes were expressed at the same level in the two states. However, the 0.5% of genes that showed different levels of expression may provide insight into what happens in the brain during sleep. Most of the genes that were more highly expressed in the awake brain could be placed into one of three groups. One group icludes what are called immediate early genes , genes that code for transcrition factors that affect the expression of other genes. Some of these genes appear to be related to changes in synaptic strength. The low expression of these genes during sleep may be associated with the fact that learning and memory formation are largely absent in this state. The second group of genes comes from mitochondria. Increased expression of these genes may play a role in satisfying the higher metabolic demands of the awake brain. The third group includes genes related to responses to cellular stress",

A different group of genes was most highly expressed during sleep, and some of them might contribute to increased protein synthesis and syaptic plasticity mechanisms that complement those most prevalent duing waking. An important point is that the sleep-related changes in gene expression were specifi c to the brain, and they did not change in other tissues, such as the liver and skeletal muscle. This is consistent with the widely held hypothesis that sleep is a process generated by the brain for the benefi t of the brain. CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS Almost all land animals coordinate their behavior according to circadian rhythms , the daily cycles of daylight and darkness that result from the spin of the Earth. (The term is from the Latin circa , “approximately,” and dies , “day.”) The precise schedules of circadian rhythms vary among species. Some animals are active during daylight hours, others only at night, and others mainly at the transitional periods of dawn and dusk. Most physiological and biochemical processes in the body also rise and fall with daily rhythms; body temperature, blood fl ow, urine production, homone levels, hair growth, and metabolic rate all fl uctuate (Figure 19.22). In humans, there is an approximately inverse relationship between the propensity to sleep and body temperature. When the cycles of daylight and darkness are removed from an anmal’s environment, circadian rhythms continue on more or less the same schedule because the primary clocks for circadian rhythms are not astrnomical (the sun and Earth) but biological in the brain. Brain clocks, like all clocks, are imperfect and require occasional resetting.

It seemed obvious to many people that the plant simply reacted to sunlight with some kind of refl ex movement. In 1729, French physicist Jean Jacques d’Ortous de Mairan tested the obvious; he put some mimosa plants in a dark closet and found that they continued to raise and lower their leaves. But a surprising new observation can still lead to a wrong conclusion. It was de Mairan’s opinion that the plant was still somehow sensing the sun’s movement, even in the darkness",

It was de Mairan’s opinion that the plant was still somehow sensing the sun’s movement, even in the darkness. More than a century later, Swiss botanist Augustin de Candolle showed that a similar plant in the dark moved its leaves up and down every 22 hours, rather than every 24 hours, according to the sun’s movement. This iplied that the plant was not responding to the sun and very likely had an internal biological clock. Environmental time cues (light/dark, temperature and humidity varations) are collectively termed zeitgebers (German for “time givers”). In the presence of zeitgebers, animals become entrained to the day–night rhythm and maintain an activity cycle of exactly 24 hours. Obviously, even small, consistent errors of timing could not be tolerated for long. A 24.5-hour cycle would, within 3 weeks, completely shift an animal from daytime to nighttime activity. When mammals are completely deprived of zeitgebers, they settle into a rhythm of activity and rest that often has a period more or less than 24 hours, in which case their rhythms are said to free-run . In mice, the natural free-running period is about 23 hours, in hamsters it is close to 24 hours, and in humans it tends to be 24.5–25.5 hours (Figure 19.23). It is quite diffi cult to separate a human from all possible zeitgebers. Even inside a laboratory, society provides many subtle time cues, such as the sounds of machinery, the comings and goings of people, and the on–off cycling of heating and air conditioning. Some of the most secluded envronments are deep caves, which have been the sites for several isolation FIGURE 19.23 Circadian rhythms of sleep and wakefulness.

The subject was first eposed to 9 days of natural 24-hour cycles of light and dark, noise and quiet, and air temperature. During the middle 25 days, all time cues were removed, and the subject was free to set his own schedule. Notice that the sleep–wake cycles remained stble, but each lengthened to about 25 hours. The subject was now free-running. Notice also that the low point of body tempeature shifted from the end of the sleep period to the beginning. During the last 11 days, a 24-hour cycle of light and meals was reintroduced, the subject again entrained to a day-long rhythm, and body temperature gradually shifted back to its normal point in the sleep cycle.

When people in caves are allowed to set their own schedules of ativity for months on end—waking and sleeping, turning lights on and off, and eating when they choose—they initially settle into roughly a 25-hour rhythm. But after days to weeks, their activity may begin to free-run with a surprisingly long period of 30–36 hours. They may stay awake for about 20 hours straight, then sleep for about 12 hours, and this pattern seems perfectly normal to them at the time. In isolation experiments, behavior and physiology do not always cotinue to cycle together. Recent studies have found that body temperature and other physiological measures may continue to change reliably over a 24-hour cycle, even if people are entrained on a 20-hour or 28-hour “day” with artifi cial lighting. This means that the rhythms of temperature and sleeping–waking, which are normally synchronized to a 24-hour period, become desynchronized",

In the cave experiments described earlier, there can be even larger differences in the periods of behavioral and physiologcal cycles, when people are allowed to set their own schedules. Normally, our lowest body temperature occurs shortly before we awaken in the morning, but when desynchronized, this temperature nadir can drift, fi rst moving earlier into the sleep period, and then into waking time. Sleep quality and waking comfort are impaired when cycles are desynchronized. One implication of this desynchronization is that the body has more than one biological clock because sleeping–waking and temperature can cycle at their own pace, uncoupled from one another. Desynchronization may occur temporarily when we travel and force our bodies suddenly into a new sleep–wake cycle. This is the familiar experience known as jet lag , and the best cure is bright light, which helps resynchronize our biological clocks. The primary zeitgeber for mature mammals is the light–dark cycle. A mother’s hormone levels may be the fi rst zeitgeber for some mammals, however, already entraining their activity levels in the womb. In stuies of various adult animals, effective zeitgebers have also included the periodic availability of food or water, social contact, environmental teperature cycles, and noise–quiet cycles. Although many of these are much less effective than light–dark cycles, they may be important for particular species, in certain circumstances. The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus: A Brain Clock A biological clock that produces circadian rhythms consists of several components: Light sensor → Clock → Output pathway One or more input pathways are sensitive to light and dark and entrain the clock and keep its rhythm coordinated with the circadian rhythms of the environment. The clock itself continues to run and keep its basic rhythm even when the input pathway is removed",

Output pathways from the clock allow it to control certain brain and body functions according to the timing of the clock. Mammals have a tiny pair of neuron clusters in the hypothalamus that serves as a biological clock: the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) , intrduced in Chapter 15. Each SCN has a volume of less than 0.3 mm 3 , and its neurons are among the smallest in the brain. They are located on either side of the midline, bordering the third ventricle (Figure 19.24). When the SCN is stimulated electrically, circadian rhythms can be shifted in a predictable way. Removal of both nuclei abolishes the circadian rhythmicity of physical activity, sleeping and waking, and feeding and Pituitary Optic chiasm SCN Third ventricle SCN Optic chiasm Hypothalamus ▲ FIGURE 19.24 The human suprachiasmatic nuclei.

In hamsters, the transplantation of a new SCN can restore rhythms within 2–4 weeks (Box 19.5). The brain’s internal rhythms never return without an SCN. Lesions in the SCN do not abolish sleeping, however, and animals will continue to coordinate their sleeping and waking with light–dark cycles if they are present. Sleep appears to be regulated by a mechanism other than the circadian clock, which depends primarily on the amount and timing of prior sleep. Because behavior is normally synchronized with light–dark cycles, there must also be a photosensitive mechanism for resetting the brain clock. The SCN accomplishes this via the retinohypothalamic tract: Axons from ganglion cells in the retina synapse directly on the dendrites of SCN neurons",

When recordings are made from neurons of the SCN, many are indeed sensitive to light. Unlike the more familiar neurons of the visual pathways (see Chapter 10), SCN neurons have very large, nonselective receptive fi elds and respond to the luminance of light stimuli rather than their orientation or motion. Research in the last decade suggests, surprisingly, that the retinal cells synchronizing the SCN are neither rods nor cones. It had long been known that eyeless mice cannot use light to reset their clocks, but mutant mice with intact retinas that lack rods and cones can! Since rods and cones were the only known photoreceptors in mammals, it remained a mystery how light could affect the circadian clock without them. This mystery was solved by David Berson of Brown University and his colleagues",

They discovered a new photoreceptor in the retina that was not at all like rods and cones but was, remarkably, a very specialized type of ganglion cell. Recall from Chapter 9 that ganglion cells are retinal neurons whose axons send visual information to the rest of the brain; ganglion cells, like nearly all other neurons in the brain, were not suposed to be directly sensitive to light. The light-sensitive ganglion cells, however, express a unique type of photopigment called melanopsin , which is not present in rods and cones. These neurons are very slowly excited by light, and their axons send a signal directly to the SCN that can reset the circadian clock that resides there. Mutant Hamster Clocks G olden hamsters are perfectionists of circadian timing. When placed in constant darkness, they continue sleeping and waking, running on their wheels, and eating and drinking over an average period of 24.1 hours for weeks on end. It was this dependability that made neuroscientists Martin Ralph and Michael Menaker, then working at the University of Oregon, notice when one of the hamsters in their laboratory began punching in with 22.0-hour cycles during a period of 3 weeks in the dark. This maverick male was bred with three females of unimpeachable circadian character (their frerunning periods were 24.01, 24.03, and 24.04 hours—quite normal). When 20 pups from the three resulting litters were tested in the dark, their free-running periods were evenly split into two narrow groups. Half had periods of 24.0 hours and half had periods of 22.3 hours. Further cross-breeding showed that the hamsters with the shorter circadian periods had one mutant copy of a gene ( tau ) that was dominant over their normal gene",

After further breeding, Ralph and Menaker found that animals with two copies of the mutant tau gene had free-running periods of only 20 hours! The tau mutation was eventually identifi ed as a specifi c kinase that interacts with certain clock genes (see Figure 19.27). Hamsters with mutant circadian rhythms provided a covincing way to answer a fundamental question: Is the SCN the brain’s circadian clock? Ralph, Menaker, and their coleagues found that when both SCNs of a hamster were ablated, rhythms were entirely lost. But rhythms could be restored to these ablated animals by simply transplanting a new SCN into their hypothalamus and waiting about a week. The key fi nding was that hamsters receiving transplants adopted the circadian rhythm of the transplanted SCN, not the rhythm they were born with. In other words, if a genetically nomal hamster with SCN lesions received an SCN from a donor with one copy of the mutant tau gene, it subsequently cycled at about 22 hours. If its transplanted SCN came from an animal with two mutant tau s, it cycled at 20 hours. This is very copelling evidence that the SCN is the master circadian clock in the hamster brain and probably in our own brain as well. Short circadian periods were often devastating to a mutant hamster’s lifestyle when it was placed into normal 24-hour light and dark cycles. A hamster’s normal preference is to be active at night, but most tau animals could not completely entrain to the 24-hour rhythm. Instead, they found their actiity periods continually shifting through various parts of the light–dark cycle. A similar problem sometimes occurs in people, most often in the elderly. Due to an age-dependent shortening of the cicadian rhythm, overwhelming sleepiness begins in early evning, and awakening comes at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning",

O F S P E C I A L I N T E R E S T BOX 19.5 679 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP Output axons of the SCN mainly innervate nearby parts of the hypthalamus, but some also go to the midbrain and other parts of the diecephalon. Because almost all SCN neurons use GABA as their primary neurotransmitter, presumably they inhibit the neurons they innervate. It is not yet clear how the SCN sets the timing of so many important behaviors. Extensive lesions in the efferent SCN pathways disrupt circdian rhythms. In addition to the axonal output pathways, SCN neurons may rhythmically secrete the peptide neuromodulator vasopressin (see Chapter 15). SCN Mechanisms How do neurons of the SCN keep time? It’s clear that each SCN cell is a minuscule clock that keeps time with regular ticks and tocks of its mlecular machinery. The ultimate isolation experiment has been simply to remove neurons from the SCN of an animal and grow each cell alone in a tissue culture dish, segregating them from the rest of the brain and from each other. Nevertheless, their rates of action potential fi ring, glcose utilization, vasopressin production, and protein synthesis continue to vary with rhythms of about 24 hours, just as they do in the intact brain (Figure 19.26). SCN cells in culture can no longer be entrained to light– dark cycles (input from the eyes is necessary for this), but their basic rhythmicity remains intact and expresses itself just as it does when an animal is deprived of zeitgebers. SCN cells communicate their rhythmic message to the rest of the brain through efferent axons, using action potentials in the usual way, and rates of SCN cell fi ring vary with a circadian rhythm",

SCN cells communicate their rhythmic message to the rest of the brain through efferent axons, using action potentials in the usual way, and rates of SCN cell fi ring vary with a circadian rhythm. However, action potentials are not necessary for SCN neurons to maintain their rhythm. When tetrodotoxin (TTX), a blocker of sodium channels, is applied to SCN cells, it blocks their action potentials but has no effect on the rhythmicity of their metabolism and biochemical functions. When the TTX is removed, action potentials resume fi ring with the same phase and frequency they had originally, before the TTX, implying that the SCN clock keeps runing even without action potentials. SCN action potentials are like the hands of a clock; removing the clock’s hands does not stop the innards of the clock from working, but it does make it impossible to read the time in the usual way. What is the nature of this clock that functions without action potentials? Research in a wide range of species indicates that it is a molecular cycle based on gene expression. The molecular clock used in humans is similar to those found in mice, fruit fl ies ( Drosophila ), and even bread mold. In Drosophila and mice, the system involves a variety of clock genes. Some of the more important genes in mammals are known as period (per) , crytochrome , and clock. Although the details vary across species, the basic scheme is a negative feedback loop. Many of the details were fi rst worked out in experiments performed by Joseph Takahashi and his colleagues at Northwestern University, who named the clock gene (an acronym for circadian locomotor output cycles kaput ). A clock gene is transcribed to produce mRNA that is then translated into proteins. After a delay, the newly manufactured proteins send feedback and interact with the trascription mechanism, causing a decrease in gene expression. As a cosequence of decreased transcription, less protein is produced, and gene expression again increases to start the cycle anew",

Light informtion from the retina serves to reset the clocks in the SCN neurons each day, but the SCN neurons also communicate directly with each other. Surprisingly, the coordination of rhythms between SCN cells seems to be independent of action potentials and normal synaptic transmission because TTX does not block them. Also, the SCN of the very young rat brain coordinates circadian rhythms perfectly well, even before it has dveloped any chemical synapses. The nature of neuron-to-neuron commnication within the SCN is poorly understood, but in addition to classical chemical synapses, it includes other chemical signals, electrical synapses (gap junctions), and the participation of glia. Research has shown that nearly every cell of the body, including those in the liver, kidney, and lung, has a circadian clock. The same types of gene transcription feedback loops that drive the SCN clock also drive the clocks in these peripheral tissues.

How does the SCN govern the innumerable clocks scattered throughout the body’s ogans? Several signaling pathways seem to be important. The SCN has a strong circadian infl uence on the autonomic nervous system, core body temperature, adrenal gland hormones such as cortisol, and neural cicuits that control feeding, movement, and metabolism (Figure 19.28). Each of these processes in turn regulates many of the body’s circadian clocks. Body temperature, for example, has a powerful effect on the clocks of peripheral tissues. It drops sharply by about 1°C each night under the infl uence of the SCN (see Figure 19.22). This pulse of cooling helps to ensure that the clocks of the internal organs all remain set to the daily rhythms of the SCN and thus to the cycles of environmental dark and light. Interestingly, the SCN’s circadian clock is very resistant – Clock gene mRNA Protein Retinal input Output to brain SCN FIGURE 19.27 Clock genes. In the SCN, clock genes produce proteins that inhibit further transcription. Gene transcription and the firing rate of individual SCN neurons cycle up and down over 24 hours. The cycles of many cells are synchronized by light exposure (input from the retina) and by interactions of the SCN neurons. 681 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP to temperature changes; this makes sense because it ensures that the SCN, which controls core temperature changes, is not destabilized by its own control signals. The complex systems that coordinate the body’s clocks are not perfect. Odd feeding schedules, chronic doses of methamphetamine and, as we mentioned previously, extreme living conditions (long-term cave dweling) can all desynchronize the body’s circadian clocks.

They also span a broad range of frequencies, from more than 500 Hz in the cotical EEG to once per year (0.00000003 Hz) for many seasonal behaviors, such as the autumn mating of deer, the winter hibernation of chipmunks, and the instinct that drives migrating swallows to return to Capistrano, California every March 19.

While the purpose of some rhythms is obvious, the functions of many neural rhythms are unknown. Indeed, some rhythms may have no funtion at all but arise as a secondary consequence of neural interconnetions that are essential for other, nonrhythmic, purposes. Among the most conspicuous yet inexplicable of brain rhythms is sleep. Sleep provides a fascinating set of problems for neuroscience. Unlike most studies of single ion channels, single neurons, or the systems mediating perception and movement, sleep research begins with profound ignorance about a most basic question: Why? We still don’t know why we spend onthird of our lives sleeping, most of that time languid and vegetative and the rest of it paralyzed and hallucinating",

(In Greek mythology, the beautiful young woman Psyche was the personifi cation of the human soul.) Aspects of brain function that are disturbed by mental illness—our fears, moods, and thoughts—were once considered beyond the reach of neuroscience. But, as we saw in the earlier chapters of Part III, many higher brain funtions have begun to yield their secrets. Today, there is hope that neuroscence will also solve the riddle of mental illness. In this chapter, we will discuss some of the most severe and prevalent psychiatric disorders: anxiety disorders, affective disorders, and schizphrenia. Once again, we will see that a great deal can be learned about the nervous system by studying what happens when things go wrong. MENTAL ILLNESS AND THE BRAIN Human behavior is the product of brain activity, and the brain is the product of two interacting factors: heredity and environment. Obviously, one important determinant of your individualism is your complement of DNA, which, unless you have an identical twin, is unique. This means that physically your brain, like your fi ngerprints, is different from all others. A second factor that makes your brain unique is your history of personal experience. Experiences can include trauma and disease, but, as we saw in the case of somatosensory map plasticity (see Chapter 12), the sensory environment itself can leave a permanent mark on the brain. (We’ll return to this theme in Part IV of this book when we discuss dvelopment, learning, and memory.) Thus, despite the gross physical simlarities you might share with a genetic twin, at a fi ne scale, neither your brains nor your behaviors are identical. To complicate matters further, variations in genetic makeup and past experience make the brain diferentially susceptible to modifi cation by subsequent experiences",

These genetic and experiential variations, all ultimately expressed as physical changes in the brain, give rise to the full range of behaviors exhibited by the human population. Health and illness are two points along a continuum of bodily function, and the same can be said for mental health and mental illness. While we all have our odd characteristics, an individual is said to be “mentally ill” at the point when the person has a diagnosable disorder of thought, mood, or behavior that causes distress or impaired functioning. An unfortunate legacy of our past ignorance about brain function is the common distintion drawn between “physical” and “mental” health. The philosophical roots of this distinction can be traced to Descartes’s proposed separtion of body and mind (see Chapter 1). Disorders of the body (which, for Descartes, included the brain) had an organic basis and were the concern of physicians and medicine. Disorders of the mind, on the other hand, were considered spiritual or moral and were the concern of clergymen I NT R O D U C TIO N M E N T A L I L LN ES S AN D T HE B R A IN 753 CHAPTER 22 MENTAL ILLNESS and religion. The fact that most disorders of mood, thought, and behavior have, until very recently, remained resistant to biological explanations or treatments has reinforced this dichotomy. Psychosocial Approaches to Mental Illness An important advance in the secularization of mental illness was the emergence of the medical discipline of psychiatry, devoted to treating disorders of human behavior. The Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) had an enormous impact on the new fi eld, especially in the United States (Figure 22.1)",

    "chunk_text": ". The Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) had an enormous impact on the new fi eld, especially in the United States (Figure 22.1). Freud’s theory of psychanalysis is based on two major assumptions that (1) much of mental life is unconscious (beyond awareness), and (2) past experiences, particularly in childhood, shape how a person will feel and respond throughout life. According to Freud, mental illness results when the unconscious and coscious elements of the psyche come into confl ict. The way to resolve the confl ict, and to treat the illness, is to help the patient unearth the hiden secrets of the unconscious. Often, these dark secrets are related to incidents (e.g., physical, mental, or sexual abuse) that occurred during childhood and were suppressed from consciousness. A different theory of personality, championed by Harvard University psychologist B. F. Skinner (1904–1990), is based on the assumption that many behaviors are learned responses to the environment. Behaviorism rejects the notions of underlying confl icts and the unconscious and focuses instead on observable behaviors and their control by the environment. In Chapter 16, we learned about some of the forces that motivate behavior. The probability of a type of behavior increases when it satisfi es a craving or produces a pleasurable sensation (positive reinforcement), and it dcreases when the consequences are deemed unpleasant or unsatisfactory (negative reinforcement). According to this theory, mental disorders may represent maladaptive behaviors that are learned. Treatment consists of active attempts to “unlearn” through behavior modifi cation, either by itroducing new types of behavioral reinforcement or by providing an oppotunity to observe and recognize behavioral responses that are appropriate. Such “psychosocial” approaches to treating mental illness have a sound neurobiological basis",

The brain is structurally modifi ed through learning and early experience, and these modifi cations will alter behavioral rsponses. Treatment relies on psychotherapy , the use of verbal communcation to help the patient. Of course, “talk therapy” is not appropriate for all mental disorders, any more than a particular antibiotic is appropriate for all infections. However, until the revolution in biological psychiatry, variations in psychotherapy were the only tools available to psychiatrists. Moreover, despite the shift in “blame” away from one’s moral character and toward early childhood experience, psychotherapy contributed to the stigmatizing notion that mental illness (in contrast to physical ilness) could be overcome by willpower alone. Freud himself recognized the shortcomings of psychotherapy, stating that the “defi ciencies in our [the psychoanalytic] description would probably vanish if we were already in a position to replace the psychological terms by physiological or chemical ones” (1920, p. 54). Now, nearly a century later, neuroscience has avanced to a point where this goal seems attainable. Biological Approaches to Mental Illness A spectacular success in the early biological diagnosis and treatment of mental illness actually occurred during Freud’s time.

Once the cause was known, increasingly effective treaments quickly followed. By 1910, German microbiologist Paul Ehrlich had established that the drug arsphenamine could act as a “magic bullet,” killing the T. pallidum in the blood without damaging its human host. Eventually, the antibiotic penicillin (discovered in 1928 by British mcrobiologist Alexander Fleming) was found to be so effective in killing the microorganism that established brain infections could be completely eradicated. Thus, when penicillin became widely available by the end of World War II, a major psychiatric disorder was virtually eliminated. A number of other mental illnesses can be traced directly to biologcal causes. For example, a dietary defi ciency in niacin (a B vitamin) can cause agitation, impaired reasoning, and depression. The penetration of HIV (the AIDS virus) into the brain causes progressive cognitive and behavioral impairments. A form of obsessive-compulsive disorder (dicussed later) has been linked to an autoimmune response triggered by streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat) in children. Understanding the causes of these diseases will lead to treatments and, ultimately, to cures of the associated mental disorders. The Promise and Challenge of Molecular Medicine in Psychiatry. Of course, serious mental disorders also occur in well-nourished and infetion-free individuals. Although the causes in most cases remain to be dtermined, it is safe to say that the roots of these disorders lie in altered brain anatomy, chemistry, and function.

The approach of using genetic information to develop a treatment is sometimes referred to as molecular medicine . A path from gene to treatment is illustrated in Figure 22.2. Searching the DNA of individuals with a psychiatric disease may reveal causative gene mutations that can be reproduced in genetically engineered mice. By comparing the neurobiology of these animals with normal, “wild type” mice, researchers can determine how the brain functions differently in association with these mutations. Discovery of an abnormal physiological condition, or pathophysiology , may suggest biological processes that can be targeted with drug therapy—for example, too much or too little of a neurotransmitter. If drug candidates succeed in human clinical trials, then new therapeutics can be introduced to treat the disease. Despite the enormous promise of molecular medicine, brain diseases present some unique challenges. First, mental disorders are diagnosed by clinicians based on how they appear or are described by the patient (signs and symptoms), not by knowledge of their underlying cause (etiology). It is now understood that the same diagnosis may arise from many causes, so no single treatment approach is likely to succeed in all patients, thus complicating clinical trials. Second, not all mental illnesses have a clear genetic basis, and for those that do, a large number of genes have been implicated. In some cases, it appears that pathophysiology may be caused by inheritance of numerous small mutations in many different genes. In these cases, although no single mutation has much effect, together they 755 CHAPTER 22 MENTAL ILLNESS greatly increase the risk for a mental illness (metaphorically, death by a thousand small knife cuts)",

Although each specifi c variant occurs rarely in the human population, variation in many different segments of DNA can result in the same diagnosis (by analogy, death by a gunshot wound; although the end result is the same, each fatal wound can uniquely affect a different part of the body). This genetic complexity interferes with development of broadly useful animal models. A radical new approach to overcome these challenges is to study the pathophysiology of neurons from individual patients. Don’t worry; this does not entail a brain biopsy! Rather, the approach takes advantage of the recent discovery that if skin cells scraped from a patient are treated with the correct mixture of chemicals, they can be transformed into what Cl O NH H 3 C Human psychiatric disease Gene discovery Mouse disease model Disease pathophysiology Target identification and drug development Human clinical trials New medicines FIGURE 22.2 Molecular medicine.

Treatment with another mixture of chemicals can then cause these cells to diffeentiate into neurons that can be kept alive in a culture dish. These nerons can then be compared with those from healthy people to determine their pathophysiology. However, the major challenge with this approach is that the brain is far more complicated than a single neuron. The brain is composed of myriad cell types that are richly interconnected, and gene mutations manifest differently in different types of neurons. Treatment for pathophysiology of a neuron may not be appropriate for the pathphysiology of a brain.

Now let’s explore the major psychiatric disorders and see how neuroscience has already both provided insight about their possible causes and contributed to their treatment. ANXIETY DISORDERS Fear is an adaptive response to threatening situations. As we learned in Chapter 18, fear is expressed by the autonomic fi ght-or-fl ight response, mediated by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) (see Chapter 15). Many fears are innate and species-specifi c. A mouse does not need to be taught to fear a cat. But fear is also learned. One touch is usually all it takes to cause a horse to fear an electric fence. The adaptive value of fear is obvious. As the old aviation saying goes, “There are old pilots, and there are bold pilots, but there are no old bold pilots.” But fear is not an appropriate or adaptive response in all cicumstances. An inappropriate expression of fear characterizes anxiety disorders , the most common of psychiatric disorders. A Description of Anxiety Disorders It has been estimated that in any given year, over 15% of Americans will suffer from one of the recognized anxiety disorders listed in Table 22.1. Although they differ in terms of the real or imagined stimuli that evoke the anxiety, and the behavioral responses the individual uses to attempt to rduce it, these disorders have in common the pathological expression of fear",

The symptoms include palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, tingling sesations, and chills or blushing. Most people report an overwhelming fear that they are dying or “going crazy,” and fl ee from the place where the attack begins, often seeking emergency medical assistance. The attacks are short-lived, however, usually lasting less than 30 minutes. Panic attacks can occur in response to specifi c stimuli. They may be a feature of a number of anxiety disorders, but they can also occur spontaneously. The condition that psychiatrists call panic disorder is characterized by recurring, seemingly unprovoked panic attacks and a persistent worry about having further attacks. About 2% of the population suffers from panic disorder, which is twice as common in women as in men. The onset of the disorder is most common after adolescence but before the age of 50 years",

The onset of the disorder is most common after adolescence but before the age of 50 years. Half the individuals who have panic disorder will also suffer from major depression (see below), and 25% of them will become alcoholic or develop substance-abuse problems. Agoraphobia. Severe anxiety about being in situations where escape might be diffi cult or embarrassing is characteristic of agoraphobia (from the Greek, for “fear of an open marketplace”). The anxiety leads to avoiance of situations irrationally perceived as threatening, such as being alone outside the home, in a crowd of people, in a car or airplane, or on a bridge or elevator. Agoraphobia is often an adverse outcome of panic diorder, as the situation in Box 22.1 describes. About 5% of the population is agoraphobic, with the incidence among women being twice that of men. Other Disorders Characterized by Increased Anxiety Several disorders that are no longer classifi ed by the American Psychiatric Association as “anxiety disorders” are nevertheless characterized by icreased anxiety. Two of the most prevalent are post-traumatic stress diorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. To a pathologist, trauma refers to a wound caused by sudden violence. In the realm of psychiatry, the term rfers to the psychological wounds of experiencing or witnessing a shocking event or events. A long-lasting consequence can be post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. The symptoms of PTSD can include increased anxiety, intrusive memories, dreams or fl ashbacks of the traumatic experiences, irritability, and emotional numbness. PTSD affects 3.5% of the adult poulation in the United States. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. People with obsessivcompulsive disorder (OCD) have obsessions , which are recurrent, intrusive thoughts, images, ideas, or impulses that the person perceives as being inappropriate, grotesque, or forbidden",

These thoughts are recognized by the affected individual as being foeign, and they evoke considerable anxiety. People with OCD also have compulsions , which are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that are peformed to reduce the anxiety associated with obsessions. Examples are repeated hand-washing, counting, and checking to make sure that somthing is not out of place. OCD affects over 2% of the population, with an equal incidence among men and women. The disorder usually appears in young adult life, and the symptoms fl uctuate in response to stress levels. 758 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR O F S P E C I A L I N T E R E S T BOX 22.1 Agoraphobia with Panic Attacks T o appreciate the distress and disruption caused by anxiety disorders, consider the following case history from Nancy C. Andreasen’s book, The Broken Brain . Greg Miller is a 27-year-old unmarried computer programer. When asked about his main problem, he replied, “I am afraid to leave my house or drive my car.” The patient’s problems began approximately one year ago. At that time he was driving across the bridge that he must traverse every day in order to go to work. While driing in the midst of the whizzing six-lane traffi c, he began to think (as he often did) about how awful it would be to have an accident on that bridge. His small, vulnerable VW convertible could be crumpled like an aluminum beer can, and he could die a bloody, painful death or be crippled for life. His car could even hurtle over the side of the bridge and plunge into the river. As he thought about these possibilities, he began to feel increasingly tense and anxious. He glanced back and forth at the cars on either side of him and became frightened that he might run into one of them. Then he experienced an overwhelming rush of fear and panic",

His heart started pounding and he felt as if he were going to suffocate. He began to take deeper and deeper breaths, but this only increased his sense of suffocation. His chest felt tight and he wondered if he might be about to die of a heart attack. He certainly felt that something dreadful was going to happen to him quite soon. He stopped his car in the far right lane in order to try to regain control of his body and his feelings. Traffi c piled up behind with many honking horns, and drivers pulled around him yelling obscenities. On top of his terror, he experienced mortifi cation. After about three minutes, the feeling of panic slowly subsided, and he was able to proceed across the bridge and go to work. During the remainder of the day, however, he worried constantly about whether or not he would be able to make the rturn trip home across the bridge without a recurrence of the same crippling fear. He managed to do so that day, but during the next several weeks he would begin to experience anxiety as he approached the bridge, and on three or four occasions he had a recurrence of the crippling attack of panic. The panic attacks began to occur more frequently so that he had them daily. By this time he was overwhelmed with fear and began to stay home from work, calling in sick each day. He knew that his main symptom was an irrational fear of driving across the bridge, but he suspected that he might also have some type of heart problem. He saw his family doctor, who found no evidence of any serious medcal illness, and who told him that his main problem was excessive anxiety. The physician prescribed a tranquilizer for him and told him to try to return to work. For the next six months, Greg struggled with his fear of driving across the bridge. He was usually unsuccesful and continued to miss a great deal of work",

Finally, he was put on disability for a few months and told by the company doctor to seek psychiatric treatment. Greg was reluctant and embarrassed to do this, and instead he stayed home most of the time, reading books, listening to records, playing chess on his Apple computer, and doing various “handy-man” chores around the house. As long as he stayed home, he had few problems with anxiety or the dreadful attacks of panic. But when he tried to drive his car, even to the nearby shopping center, he would somtimes have panic attacks. Consequently, he found himself staying home nearly all the time and soon became essetially housebound. (Andreasen, 1984, pp. 65–66) Biological Bases of Anxiety Disorders A genetic predisposition has been established for many anxiety disorders. Other anxiety disorders appear to be rooted more in the occurrence of stressful life events. Fear is normally evoked by a threatening stimulus, called a stressor , and it is manifest by a response known as the stress response. As metioned previously, the stimulus–response relationship can be strengtened by experience (recall the horse and the electric fence), but it can also be weakened. Consider, for example, an expert skier who no longer views a precipitous drop as fearful. A healthy person regulates the stress response through learning. The hallmark of anxiety disorders is the occurrence of an inappropriate stress response either when a stressor is not present or when it is not immediately threatening. Thus, a key to understanding anxiety is to understand how the stress response is regulated by the brain. 759 CHAPTER 22 MENTAL ILLNESS The Stress Response. The stress response is the coordinated reaction to threatening stimuli",

It is characterized by the following: • Avoidance behavior • Increased vigilance and arousal • Activation of the sympathetic division of the ANS • Release of cortisol from the adrenal glands It should come as no surprise that the hypothalamus is centrally ivolved in orchestrating appropriate humoral, visceromotor, and somatic motor responses (see Chapters 15 and 16). To get an idea of how this response is regulated, let’s focus on the humoral response, which is medated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Figure 22.3). As we learned in Chapter 15, the hormone cortisol (a glucocorticoid) is released from the adrenal cortex in response to an elevation in the blood level of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) . ACTH is released by the anterior pituitary gland in response to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) . CRH is released into the blood of the portal circulation by parvocellular neurosecretory neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Thus, this arm of the stress response can be traced back to activation of the CRH-containing neurons of the hypothalamus. Much can be learned about anxiety disorders by understanding how the activity of these neurons is regulated. For example, when CRH is oveexpressed in genetically engineered mice, the animals display increased anxiety-like behaviors. When the receptors for CRH are genetically elimnated from mice, they have less anxiety-like behavior than normal mice.

    "chunk_text": ". CRH is the chemical messenger between the paraventriclar nucleus of the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary gland. ACTH released by the pituitary gland travels in the bloodstream to the adrenal gland lying atop the kidney, where it stimulates cortisol release. Cortisol contributes to the body’s physiological response to stress. 760 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR Regulation of the HPA Axis by the Amygdala and Hippocampus. The CRH neurons of the hypothalamus are regulated by two structures that were introduced in earlier chapters: the amygdala and the hippocampus (Figure 22.4). As we learned in Chapter 18, the amygdala is critical to fear responses. Sensory information enters the basolateral amygdala, where it is processed and relayed to neurons in the central nucleus. When the cetral nucleus of the amygdala becomes active, the stress response ensues (Figure 22.5). Inappropriate activation of the amygdala, as measured using fMRI (see Box 7.3), has been associated with some anxiety disoders. Downstream from the amygdala is a collection of neurons called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis . The bed nucleus neurons activate the HPA axis and the stress response. The HPA axis is also regulated by the hippocampus. However, hipocampal activation suppresses, rather than stimulates, CRH release.

    "chunk_text": ". This information is integrated by the basolateral nuclei and is relayed to the central nucleus. Activation of the central nucleus leads to the stress response. 761 CHAPTER 22 MENTAL ILLNESS The hippocampus contains numerous glucocorticoid receptors that respond to the cortisol released from the adrenal gland in response to HPA system activation. Thus, the hippocampus normally participates in the feedback regulation of the HPA axis by inhibiting CRH release (and the subsequent release of ACTH and cortisol) when circulating cortisol levels get too high. Continuous exposure to cortisol, such as during perods of chronic stress, can cause hippocampal neurons to wither and die in experimental animals (see Box 15.1). This degeneration of the hippcampus may set off a vicious cycle, in which the stress response becomes more pronounced, leading to even greater cortisol release and more hipocampal damage. Human brain imaging studies have shown a decrease in the volume of the hippocampus in some people suffering from PTSD. To summarize, the amygdala and the hippocampus regulate the HPA axis and the stress response in a push–pull fashion (Figure 22.6). Anxiety disoders have been related to both hyperactivity of the amygdala and diminished activity of the hippocampus. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the amygdala and hippocampus both receive highly processed information from the neocortex. Indeed, another consistent fi nding in humans with anxety disorders has been elevated activity of the prefrontal cortex. Treatments for Anxiety Disorders Several treatments are available for anxiety disorders. In many cases, patients respond well to psychotherapy and counseling; in other cases, specifi c medications are more effective. Psychotherapy. We have seen that there is a strong learning component to fear, so it should not be surprising that psychotherapy can be an effetive treatment for many of the anxiety disorders",

We have seen that there is a strong learning component to fear, so it should not be surprising that psychotherapy can be an effetive treatment for many of the anxiety disorders. The therapist gradually increases the exposure of the patient to the stimuli that produce anxiety, rinforcing the notion that the stimuli are not dangerous. At the neurobiologcal level, the aim of the psychotherapy is to alter connections in the brain such that the real or imagined stimuli no longer evoke the stress response. Anxiolytic Medications. Medications that reduce anxiety, described as anxiolytic drugs , act by altering chemical synaptic transmission in the brain. The major classes of drugs currently used in the treatment of anxiety disorders are benzodiazepines and serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors. Recall that GABA is an important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. GABA A receptors are GABA-gated chloride channels that mediate fast inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (see Chapter 6). The proper action of GABA is critical to the proper functioning of the brain: Too much inhbition results in coma, and too little results in seizures. In addition to its GABA-binding site, the GABA A receptor contains sites where chemicals can act to powerfully modulate channel function. Benzodiazepines bind to one of these sites and act to make GABA much more effective in opeing the channel and producing inhibition (Figure 22.7). The site on the receptor that binds benzodiazepines is believed to be used normally by a naturally occurring brain chemical, although the identity of the endoenous molecule has not been established. Benzodiazepines, of which Valium (diazepam) is perhaps the most well known, are highly effective treatments for acute anxiety. Indeed, virtally all drugs that stimulate GABA actions are anxiolytic, including the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages, ethanol. A reduction in anxiety is likely to explain, at least in part, the widespread social use of alcohol",

Amygdala activation stimulates the HPA system and the stress response (green lines). Hippocampal activation, on the other hand, suppresses the HPA system (red line).

Benzdiazepines bind to a site on the GABA A receptor that makes it much more rsponsive to GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the forebrain. A diferent site can bind ethanol and also make the receptor more responsive to GABA. 762 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR We may infer that the calming actions of benzodiazepines are due to the suppression of activity in the brain circuits used in the stress rsponse. Benzodiazepine treatment might be required to restore normal function to these circuits. Indeed, a study of patients with panic disorder using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (see Box 7.3) demostrated that the number of benzodiazepine binding sites was reduced in regions of the frontal cortex that show hyperactive responsiveness duing anxiety (Figure 22.8). These results are promising not only because they might reveal the sites of benzodiazepine action in the brain but also because they suggest that an alteration in the endogenous regulation of GABA receptors is a cause of the anxiety disorder. Serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in the treatment of mood disorders, as we will discuss in a moment",

    "chunk_text": ". Serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in the treatment of mood disorders, as we will discuss in a moment. However, SSRIs are also highly effective for treating other psychiaric disorders, notably including OCD. Recall that serotonin is released throughout the brain by a diffuse modulatory system originating in the raphe nuclei of the brain stem (see Figure 15.13). The actions of serotonin are mediated by G-protein-coupled receptors and are terminated by reutake, via serotonin transporter proteins, into the axon terminal. Thus, as the name implies, SSRIs act to prolong the actions of released serotonin at their receptors by inhibiting reuptake. In a recent study, the presence in some families of a rare mutation in the serotonin transporter gene was associated with a high incidence of OCD, further implicating serotonin in the origins of this disease. Unlike the benzodiazepines, however, the anxiolytic actions of the SSRIs are not immediate. Therapeutic effects develop slowly, over a priod of weeks, in response to regular daily dosing. This fi nding indicates that the immediate rise in extracellular serotonin caused by the SSRI is not responsible for the anxiolytic effect. Rather, the effect appears to be due to an adaptation of the nervous system to chronically elevated brain serotonin, via some structural or functional change that is not understood. ▲ FIGURE 22.8 Diminished binding of radioactive benzodiazepine in a patient with panic diorder. PET scans in the horizontal plane of the brain of a healthy person (left) and the brain of a person suffering from panic disorder (right). The color-coding indcates the number of benzodiazepine binding sites in the brain (hot colors indicate more; cool colors indicate fewer).

However, it is very interesting in the context of anxiety disoders that one adaptive response to SSRIs is an increase in the glucocortcoid receptors in the hippocampus. SSRIs might act to dampen anxiety by enhancing the feedback regulation of the CRH neurons in the hypothalmus (see Figure 22.6). Although benzodiazepines and SSRIs have proven to be effective in treating a wide variety of anxiety disorders, novel drugs are now being developed based on our new understanding of the stress response. One promising drug target is the receptors for CRH. Not only is CRH used by hypothalamic neurons to control ACTH release from the pituitary but it is also used as a neurotransmitter in some of the central circuits involved in the stress response. For example, some neurons of the central nucleus of the amygdala contain CRH, and injections of CRH into the brain can produce the full-blown stress response and signs of anxiety. Thus, there is hope that antagonists of CRH receptors will be useful for the treatment of some anxiety disorders. AFFECTIVE DISORDERS Affect is the medical term for emotional state or mood; affective disorders are disorders of mood. In a given year, over 9% of the popultion will suffer from one of the mood disorders. A Description of Affective Disorders An occasional, brief feeling of low mood—getting “the blues”—is a common response to life’s events, such as suffering a loss or disappointment, and we would not call this a disorder. However, the affective disorder that psychitrists and psychologists call depression is something more prolonged and much more severe, characterized by a feeling that one’s emotional state is no longer under one’s control. It can occur suddenly, often without obvious external cause, and if left untreated, it usually lasts 4–12 months. Depression is a serious disease",

Other symptoms also occur, including: • Loss of appetite (or increased appetite) • Insomnia (or hypersomnia) • Fatigue • Feelings of worthlessness and guilt • A diminished ability to concentrate • Recurrent thoughts of death Episodes of major depression usually don’t last longer than 2 years, although the disease has a chronic, unremitting course in about 17% of patients.

Mania (derived from a French word meaning “crazed” or “frenzied”) is a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood. During the manic phase, other common symptoms include: • Infl ated self-esteem or grandiosity • A decreased need for sleep • Increased talkativeness or feelings of pressure to keep talking • Flight of ideas, or a subjective experience that thoughts are racing • Distractibility • Increased goal-directed activity Another symptom is impaired judgment. Spending sprees, offensive or disinhibited behavior, promiscuity, or other reckless behaviors are common. According to current diagnostic criteria, there are two types of bipolar disorder. Type I bipolar disorder is characterized by the manic episodes just described (with or without incidents of major depression), and occurs in about 1% of the population, equally among men and women. Type II bipolar disorder, affecting about 0.6% of the population, is characterized by hypomania , a milder form of mania that is not associated with marked impairments in judgment or performance. Indeed, hypomania in some may take the form of a marked increase in effi ciency, accomplishment, or creativity (Box 22.2). However, type II bipolar disorder is also always associated with episodes of major depression. When hypomania altenates with periods of depression that are not severe enough to warrant the description “major” (i.e., fewer symptoms and shorter duration), the disorder is called cyclothymia .

How else can we explain the coexistence of symptoms ranging from eating and sleeping disorders to a loss of the ability to concentrate? For this reason, research has focused on the role of the diffuse modulatory systems, with their wide reach and diverse effects. However, in the last few years, disruption of the HPA system and related cortical areas has also been implicated as playing an important role in depression. Let’s take a closer look at the neurobiology of mood disorders. The Monoamine Hypothesis. The fi rst real indication that depression might result from a problem with the central diffuse modulatory systems came in the 1960s. A drug called reserpine , introduced to control high blood pressure, caused severe depression in about 20% of cases. Reserpine depletes central catecholamines and serotonin by interfering with their loading into synaptic vesicles. Another class of drugs that were introduced to treat tuberculosis caused a marked mood elevation.

    "chunk_text": ". Many artists have eloquently described their misfortunes. But can mood disorders actually reinforce great talent and creative productivity? Certainly, most people with mood diorders are not artistic or unusually imaginative, and most arists are not manic-depressive. However, artists with bipolar disorders can sometimes draw vigor and inspiration from their condition. Edgar Allan Poe wrote of his cycles of dpression and mania, “I am excessively slothful, and wondefully industrious—by fi ts.” 4 The poet Michael Drayton mused about “that fi ne madness which rightly should possess a poet’s brain.” 5 Studies have suggested that hypomania can heighten certain cognitive processes, increase original and iiosyncratic thought, and even enhance linguistic skills. Manic states can also reduce the need for sleep, foster intense and obsessive concentration, create unmitigated self-confi dence, and eliminate concern for social norms—just what you need, perhaps, to push the envelope of artistic creativity. The poet’s madness is much more often a scourge than an inspiration. For Robert Lowell, manic experiences were “a magical orange grove in a nightmare.” 6 Virginia Woolf’s huband described how “she talked almost without stopping for two or three days, paying no attention to anyone in the room or anything said to her.” 7 It is hard to overstate the depths of melancholy that can accompany major depression. The sucide rate among accomplished poets is said to be 5 to 18 times higher than in the general population. Poet John Keats once wrote desperately, “I am in that temper that if I were under water I would scarcely kick to come to the top.” 8 But when Keats’s mood pitched the other way, he wrote most of his best poetry during a 9-month period in 1819, before dying of tuberculosis at age 25.

The norepnephrine and serotonin systems, introduced in Chapter 15, are characterized by the broad reach of their axonal projections. monoamine oxidase (MAO) , the enzyme that destroys catecholamines and serotonin. Another piece of the puzzle fell into place when neuroscientists recognized that the drug imipramine, introduced some years earlier as an antidepressant, inhibits the reuptake of released serotonin and noepinephrine, thus promoting their action in the synaptic cleft. As a result of these observations, researchers developed the hypothesis that mood is closely tied to the levels of released “monoamine” neurotransmitters— norepinephrine and/or serotonin—in the brain. According to this idea, called the monoamine hypothesis of mood disorders , depression is a consequence of a defi cit in one of these diffuse modulatory systems (Figure 22.9). Indeed, as we will see in a moment, many of the modern drug treatments for depression have in common enhanced neurotranmission at central serotonergic and/or noradrenergic synapses. A direct correlation between mood and modulator, however, is too siplistic. Perhaps the most striking problem is the clinical fi nding that the antidepressant action of all of these drugs takes several weeks to develop, even though they have almost immediate effects on transmission at the modulatory synapses. Another concern is that other drugs that raise NE levels in the synaptic cleft, like cocaine, are not effective as antidpressants",

A new hypothesis is that the effective drugs promote long-term adaptive changes in the brain, involving alterations in gene expression, which alleviate the depression. One adaptation occurs in the HPA axis, which, as we’ll discuss next, has also been implicated in mood disorders. The Diathesis–Stress Hypothesis. Evidence clearly indicates that mood disorders run in families and that our genes predispose us to this type of mental illness. The medical term for a predisposition for a certain disease is diathesis . However, researchers have also established that early childhood abuse or neglect and other stresses of life are important risk factors in the development of mood disorders in adults. According to the diathesis–stress hypothesis of affective disorders , the HPA axis is the main site where genetic and environmental infl uences converge to cause mood disorders. 767 CHAPTER 22 MENTAL ILLNESS As we have seen, exaggerated activity of the HPA system is associated with anxiety disorders. However, anxiety and depression often coexist (in fact, this “comorbidity” is the rule rather than the exception). Indeed, one of the most robust fi ndings in all of biological psychiatry is hyperactivity of the HPA axis in severely depressed patients: Blood cortisol levels are elevated, as is the concentration of CRH in the cerebrospinal fl uid. Could this hypeactive HPA system, and the resulting deleterious effects on brain function, be the cause of depression? Animal studies are highly suggestive. Injected CRH into the brains of animals produces behavioral effects that are similar to those of major depression: insomnia, decreased appetite, decreased inteest in sex, and, of course, an increased behavioral expression of anxiety. Recall that the activation of the hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors by cortisol normally leads to feedback inhibition of the HPA axis (see Figure 22.6)",

In depressed patients, this feedback is disrupted, explaining why HPA function is hyperactive. A molecular basis for the diminished hippocampal response to cortisol is a decreased number of glucocorticoid receptors. What regulates glucocorticoid receptor number? In a fascinaing parallel with the factors implicated in mood disorders, the answer is genes, monoamines, and early childhood experience. Glucocorticoid receptors, like all proteins, are a product of gene epression. In rats, it has been shown that the amount of glucocorticoid receptor gene expression is regulated by early sensory experience. Rats that received a lot of maternal care as pups express more glucocorticoid receptors in their hippocampus, less CRH in their hypothalamus, and reduced anxiety as adults. The maternal infl uence can be replaced by icreasing the tactile stimulation of the pups. Tactile stimulation activates the ascending serotonergic inputs to the hippocampus, and the serotonin triggers a long-lasting increase in the expression of the glucocorticoid receptor gene. More glucocorticoid receptors equip the animal to respond to stressors as adults. However, the benefi cial effect of experience is rstricted to a critical period of early postnatal life; stimulation of the rats as adults does not have the same effect. Childhood abuse and neglect, in addition to genetic factors, are known to put people at risk for develoing mood and anxiety disorders, and these animal fi ndings suggest one cause. Elevations in brain CRH, and decreased feedback inhibition of the HPA system, may make the brain especially vulnerable to depression. Anterior Cingulate Cortex Dysfunction.

This region of the brain is considered to be a “node” in an extensive network of interconnected structures that include other regions of the frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, and brain stem. The hypothesis that anterior cingulate cortex dysfunction contributes to the symptoms of major depression is supported by a number of fi ndings, including studies that have shown that activity here is increased by autobiographical recall of a sad event and is decreased following successful medical treatment for depression. Based on these fi ndings, the anterior cingulate cortex is considered to be an important link between an internally generated emtional state and the HPA. Treatments for Affective Disorders Mood disorders are very common, and the burden they impose on human health, happiness, and productivity is enormous. Fortunately, a number of helpful treatments are available. 768 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR Electroconvulsive Therapy. It might surprise you to learn that one of the most effective treatments for depression and mania involves inducing seizure activity in the temporal lobes. In electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) , electrical currents are passed between two electrodes placed on the scalp. Localized electrical stimulation triggers seizure discharges in the brain, but the patient is given anesthesia and muscle relaxants to prevent violent movements during treatment. An advantage of ECT is that relief can occur quickly, sometimes after the fi rst treatment session. This attribute of ECT is especially important in cases where suicide risk is high. An adverse effect of ECT, however, is memory loss. As we will see in Chapter 24, temporal lobe structures (including the hippocampus) play a vital role in memory. ECT usually disrupts memories for events that occurred before treatment, and this can extend back as far as 6 months",

In addition, ECT can temporarily impair the storage of new information. The mechanism by which ECT relieves depression is unknown. However, as mentioned earlier, one temporal lobe structure affected by ECT is the hippocampus, which we have seen is involved in regulating CRH and the HPA axis. Psychotherapy. Psychotherapy can be effective in treating mild to moerate cases of depression. The main goal of psychotherapy is to help dpressed patients overcome negative views of themselves and their future. The neurobiological basis of the treatment has not been established, although we can infer that it relates to establishing cognitive, neocortical control over the activity patterns in disturbed circuits. Antidepressants. A number of highly effective pharmacological treaments are available for mood disorders. Antidepressant drugs include (1) tricyclic compounds (named for their chemical structure), such as imiramine, which among other actions, block the reuptake of both norepineprine and serotonin by transporters; (2) SSRIs, such as fl uoxetine, which act only on serotonin terminals; (3) Nand 5-HT-selective reuptake ihibitors, such as venlafaxine; and (4) MAO inhibitors, such as phenelzine, which reduce the enzymatic degradation of serotonin and norepinephrine (Figure 22.11). All of these drugs elevate the levels of monoamine nerotransmitters in the brain; however, as mentioned, their therapeutic ations take weeks to develop. The adaptive response in the brain for the clinical effectiveness of these drugs has not been established with certainty.

Activity in this region assessed by PET or fMRI imaging is increased in patients suffering from major depression and reduced by successful treatments. 769 CHAPTER 22 MENTAL ILLNESS fi nding is that clinically effective treatment with antidepressants damens the hyperactivity of the HPA system and the anterior cingulate cortex in humans. Animal studies suggest that this effect may be due, in part, to increased glucocorticoid receptor expression in the hippocampus, which occurs in response to a long-term elevation in serotonin. Recall that CRH plays a crucial role in the stress response of the HPA axis. New drugs that act as CRH receptor antagonists are currently under development and testing. Recent research has also shown that prolonged treatment with SSRIs increases neurogenesis , the proliferation of new neurons, in the hippocampus. (Neurogenesis is discussed further in Chapter 23.) Remarkably, this proliferation may be important for the benefi cial bhavioral effects of SSRIs, presumably in part by boosting the control of the HPA by the hippocampus. The long delay between treatment onset and antidepressant effect preents not only a scientifi c mystery but also a clinical challenge. Patients can feel discouraged when their expectations for improvement are not met, and this can temporarily exacerbate the depression. This is a serious limitation, particularly in cases where there is a high risk of suicide. Thus, the search is on for rapidly acting antidepressant medications that do not require weeks of treatment to become effective. The hope for attaining this goal has been fueled by recent fi ndings that a single intravenous dose of the anesthetic drug ketamine can rapidly alleviate symptoms of depresion for several days. Although these fi ndings support the concept of a rapidly acting antidepressant, ketamine itself is not a practical treatment for depression",

It is only after the drug is eliminated from the body, and psychotic symptoms diminish, that antidepressant effects are observed. Thus, as with other medical treatments for depression, the therapeutic effect is apparently caused by some adaptive response to the drug. However, in the case of ketamine, this adaptation occurs much more rapidly than with the other antidepressants used in clinical practice today. Lithium. By now, you probably have formed the (correct) impression that, until recently, most treatments for psychiatric disorders were discovered virtually by chance. For example, ECT was introduced initially in the 1930s as a treatment of last resort for psychotic behavior based on the mistaken belief that epilepsy and schizophrenia could not coexist in the same person. Only later was it shown to be an effective treatment for major depression for reasons that still remain unknown. “Enlightened serendipity” was again at work in the discovery of a highly effective treatment for bipolar disorder",

    "chunk_text": ". “Enlightened serendipity” was again at work in the discovery of a highly effective treatment for bipolar disorder. Working in the 1940s, Australian psychiatrist John Cade was searching for psychoactive substances in the urine of manic patients. He injected guinea pigs with urine or urinary costituents and observed their behavioral effects. Cade wanted to test the effect of uric acid, but he had diffi culty getting it into solution. Instead, he used lithium urate because it dissolved easily and was readily avaiable in the pharmacy. He observed, quite unexpectedly, that this treatment calmed the guinea pigs (he had predicted the opposite effect). Because other lithium salts also produced this behavioral effect, he concluded that it was the lithium, not a constituent of urine, that was responsible. He went on to test lithium treatment on patients with mania, and, amazingly, it worked. Subsequent studies showed that lithium is highly effective in stabilizing the mood of patients with bipolar disorder, by preventing not only the rcurrence of mania but also the episodes of depression (Figure 22.12). Lithium affects neurons in many ways. In solution, it is a monovlent cation that passes freely through neuronal sodium channels. Inside the neuron, lithium prevents the normal turnover of phosphatidyl insitol (PIP 2 ), a precursor for important second messenger molecules that are generated in response to activation of some G-protein-coupled nerotransmitter receptors (see Chapter 6). Lithium also interferes with the actions of adenylyl cyclase, essential for the generation of the second mesenger cyclic-AMP, and glycogen synthase kinase, a critical enzyme in celular energy metabolism.

Like other antdepressants, the therapeutic effects of lithium require long-term use. The answer, again, appears to lie in an adaptive change in the central nervous system (CNS), but the nature of this change remains to be determined. Deep Brain Stimulation. In a substantial fraction of patients, severe dpression fails to respond to ECT, medicine, or talk therapy. In such cases, more drastic measures are called for, and one entails undergoing a surgical procedure in which an electrode is implanted deep in the brain. This aproach to treat depression was pioneered by Helen Mayberg, a neurologist at Emory University (Box 22.3). Recall that activity in the anterior cinglate cortex is increased by sadness and decreased by successful treatment with standard antidepressant medications. The observation that activity in this region fails to decrease in patients with unrelenting, treatmenresistant depression inspired Mayberg to contemplate using direct brain stimulation to modulate activity here. Although it seems counterintuitive, electrical stimulation can actually decrease activity in brain circuits that are chronically overactive (the reasons remain unclear but likely include recruitment of inhibitory neurons). Indeed, Mayberg and a team of nerosurgeons at the University of Toronto found that electrical stimulation of a circumscribed region of the anterior cingulate cortex, comprising Brodmann’s area 25, could produce immediate relief from depression. Recall that during most neurosurgical procedures, the patient remains awake, which is possible because there are no pain receptors in the brain. Thus, the patients in Mayberg’s study could report the effect of stimultion during the operation. They described a “sudden calmness” or “lighness” and “disappearance of the void” when the stimulator was turned on",

Additional studies are underway to confi rm these initial results. Obviously, brain surgery is always consiered a treatment of last resort. SCHIZOPHRENIA Although their severity might be hard to fully comprehend, we all have some idea of what mood and anxiety disorders are like because they are extremes in the spectrum of brain states that are part of normal experence. The same cannot be said for schizophrenia. This severe mental diorder distorts thoughts and perceptions in ways that healthy people fi nd diffi cult to understand. Schizophrenia is a major public health problem, affecting 1% of the adult population. Over 2 million people suffer from the disorder in the United States alone. A Description of Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is characterized by a loss of contact with reality and a diruption of thought, perception, mood, and movement. The disorder typcally becomes apparent during adolescence or early adulthood and usually persists for life. The name, introduced in 1911 by Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, roughly means “divided mind,” because of his observation that many patients seemed to oscillate between normal and abnormal states.

While many patients with neurological disorders develop depression, it was often seen as a nonspecifi c response to a distressing diagnosis (stroke, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and the like). Furthermore, the notion that a global change like dpression could be localized to specifi c brain regions, the way a language defi cit might be traced to disruption of specifi c parts of the frontal or temporal lobes, was not intuitive. For the most part, strategies to study and treat depression in neurological patients mirrored those in patients with depresion without identifi ed neurological disease—focusing on brain chemistry—that is, until the early 1990s when advances in neuroimaging changed the playing fi eld. By 2001, we had learned a lot about the functional neuranatomy of depression. Using positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we had identfi ed activity patterns that subdivided depressed patients by their symptom clusters. We also studied changes that ditinguished the response to antidepressant drugs from that of psychotherapy and identifi ed baseline patterns that might guide treatment selection for each treatment. A brain wiring diagram of depression was emerging. It was around this time that we had the opportunity to directly examine the role of the subcallosal cingulate region (Brodmann’s area 25) in our evolving depression circuit (Figure A). We had converging evidence of common changes in this region across a wide variety of effective antidepresant treatments. We also knew that failure to effect changes in this region were associated with treatment nonresponse. We hypothesized that relief from major depression could be achieved with focal brain stimulation using a well-established neurosurgical technique used to treat Parkinson’s disease— deep brain stimulation (DBS)",

Treatment-resistant depression is a dire condition defi ned by failure to respond to multiple available antidepressant treatments including electroconvulsive therapy. What I had not appreciated in my years of studying depression was the banality of our defi nitions and rating scales, as they failed to capture the degree of suffering experienced by patients in what can only be described as a malignant condition, a pevasive state of sustained mental pain and physical immobility with no “off switch.” I can still remember that fi rst case on the morning of May 23, 2003. We were prepared technically: where to implant, what side effects to watch for. But otherwise, we had no expectations. How could there be when what you are doing is something that has never been done before? Our patient was awake (DBS electrodes are implanted using local anesthesia), and it was easy enough to monitor the obvious— discomfort, pain, general distress. The primary goal was to get the electrodes implanted and then turn them on and make sure nothing bad happened. Our mindset going in was that the real work would come later as we tested varous stimulation parameters to achieve clinical effects—a prcess we thought would take weeks, like other antidepressant treatments.

These are often accompanied by auditory 774 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR hallucinations (such as hearing imaginary voices) related to the same dlusional theme. There can also be a lack of emotional expression (called a “fl at affect”), coupled with disorganized behavior and incoherent speech. Speech may be accompanied by silliness and laughter that appear to have no relation to what is being said. In some cases, schizophrenia is accompanied by peculiarities of voluntary movement, such as immobility and stupor (catatonia), bizarre posturing and grimacing, and senseless, parrot-like repetition of words or phrases. Biological Bases of Schizophrenia Understanding the neurobiological basis for schizophrenia represents one of the greatest challenges of neuroscience because the disorder affects many of the characteristics that make us human: thought, perception, self-awareness. Although considerable progress has been made, we still have much more to learn. Genes and the Environment. Schizophrenia runs in families. As shown in Figure 22.13, the likelihood of having the disorder varies in relation to the number of genes that are shared with an affected family member.

The chances you will have the disease decline as the number of genes you share with an affected family member decreases. These fi ndings argue that schizophrenia is primarily a genetic disorder.

In other words, faulty genes seem to make some people vulnerable to environmental fators that cause schizophrenia. Although the symptoms may not appear until a person reaches his or her twenties, considerable evidence indcates that the biological changes causing the condition begin early in dvelopment, perhaps prenatally. Viral infections during fetal and infant development have been implicated as contributing causes, as has poor maternal nutrition. In addition, environmental stresses throughout life are known to exacerbate the course of the disorder. A number of studies have suggested that use of marijuana increases the risk for developing schizophrenia in genetically vulnerable adolescents.

Normally, the structures of the brains of identical twins are nearly idetical. However, in this case, the brain of the schizophrenic sibling shows enlarged lateral ventricles, which refl ects the shrinkage of brain tissue around them. This difference is consistent when large numbers of people are sampled; the brains of schizophrenics have, on average, a signifi - cantly larger ventricle-to-brain-size ratio than people who do not have the disorder. Such pronounced structural changes are not always apparent in the brains of schizophrenics, however. Important physical changes in their brains also occur in the microscopic structure and function of cortical conections. For example, schizophrenics often have defects in the myelin sheaths surrounding axons in their cerebral cortex, although it is not clear whether this is a cause or consequence of the disease. Another comon fi nding in schizophrenia is reduced cortical thickness and abnomal neuronal lamination (Figure 22.15). Changes in synapses and seeral neurotransmitter systems have also been implicated. As we’ll see next, particular attention has focused on alterations in chemical synaptic transmission mediated by dopamine and glutamate. The Dopamine Hypothesis. Recall that dopamine is the neurotransmiter used by another of the diffuse modulatory systems (Figure 22.16). A link between the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system and schizophrenia has been made on the basis of two main observations. The fi rst relates to the effects of amphetamine in otherwise healthy people. Remember from our discussion in Chapter 15 that amphetamine enhances neurtransmission at catecholamine-utilizing synapses and causes the release of dopamine. Amphetamine’s normal stimulant action bears little reseblance to schizophrenia. However, because of its addictive properties, users of amphetamines often risk taking more and more to satisfy their cravings",

The resulting overdose can lead to a psychotic episode with postive symptoms that are virtually indistinguishable from those of schizphrenia. This suggests that psychosis is somehow related to too much catecholamine in the brain. A second reason to associate dopamine with schizophrenia relates to the CNS effects of drugs that are effective in reducing the positive symtoms of the disorder. In the 1950s, researchers discovered that the drug chlorpromazine , initially developed as an antihistamine, could prevent the positive symptoms in schizophrenia. Chlorpromazine and other rlated antipsychotic drugs, collectively called neuroleptic drugs , were later found to be potent blockers of dopamine receptors, specifi cally the D 2 receptor.

One indication is that newly developed atipsychotic drugs, like clozapine , have little effect on D 2 receptors. These drugs are called atypical neuroleptics , indicating that they act in a novel way. The mechanism by which these compounds exert their neuroleptic effect has not been established with certainty, but an interaction with serotonin receptors is suspected. The Glutamate Hypothesis.

These drugs were introduced in the 1950s as anesthetics. However, many patients experienced adverse side effects, sometimes lasting for days, which included hallucinations and paranoia. Although it is no longer used clinically, PCP is now a common illegal drug of abuse, known by users as “angel dust” or “hog.” Ketamine, which is still used in veterinary medicine, has also made it to the street where it is referred to as “special K” or “vitamin K.” PCP and ketamine intoxication cause many of the symptoms of schizophrenia, both positive and negative. However, neither drug has an effect on dopaminergic transmission; they affect synapses that use glutamate as a neurotransmitter. Recall from Chapter 6 that glutamate is the main fast excitatory nerotransmitter in the brain, and that NMDA receptors are one subtype of glutamate receptor. PCP and ketamine act by inhibiting NMDA receptors (Figure 22.18). Thus, according to the glutamate hypothesis of schizphrenia , the disorder refl ects diminished activation of NMDA receptors in the brain. In order to study the neurobiology of schizophrenia, neuroscientists have attempted to establish animal models of the disorder. Low doses of PCP administered chronically to rats produce changes in brain biocheistry and behavior that resemble those in schizophrenic patients.

Of course, we don’t know whether the mutant mice feel paranoid or hear imaginary voices. But it is signifi cant that the obserable behavioral abnormalities can be lessened by treating the mice with either conventional or atypical neuroleptic drugs. While all drugs that inhibit NMDA receptors will impair memory and cognition, not all reproduce the positive symptoms of schizophrenia in humans. The key difference lies in the mechanism of action. PCP and ketamine do not interfere with the binding of glutamate to the receptor like other NMDA receptor inhibitors. Instead, they act by entering the channel and clogging the pore. Consequently, blockade by PCP and keamine is possible only when the receptors are active and the channels are open. This feature has led researchers to wonder if the psychomimetic effects of these drugs are mediated by a select population of neurons with high ongoing activity and tonic NMDA receptor activation. One such population is comprised of cortical GABAergic neurons in the cerebral cortex. Inhibition of the NMDA receptors on these neurons might distort thinking and the processing of sensory information. Notably, postmortem examination of the brains of individuals with schizophrenia has found the cortex to be defi cient in many interneurons. 779 CHAPTER 22 MENTAL ILLNESS Treatments for Schizophrenia The treatment of schizophrenia consists of drug therapy combined with psychosocial support.

These drugs reduce the positive symptoms of schizophrenia in the majority of patients. Unfortunately, the drugs also have numerous side effects related to their actions on the dopaminergic input to the striatum that arises from the substantia nigra (see Chapter 14). Not surprisingly, the effects of blocking dopamine receptors in the striatum resemble the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, including rigidity, tremor, and diffi culty initiaing movements. Chronic treatment with conventional neuroleptics also can result in the emergence of tardive dyskinesia , which is characterized by involuntary movements of the lips and jaw. Many of these side effects are avoided by using atypical neuroleptics, such as clozapine and risperdone, because they do not act directly on the dopamine receptors in the striatum. These medications are also more effective against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The newest focus of drug research is the NMDA receptor. Investigators hope that increasing NMDA receptor responsiveness in the brain, pehaps in combination with decreasing D 2 receptor activation, will further alleviate the symptoms of schizophrenia. CONCLUDING REMARKS Neuroscience has had a huge impact on psychiatry. Mental illness is now recognized as the consequence of pathologic modifi cations of the brain, and psychiatric treatments today are focused on correcting these changes. Just as importantly, neuroscience has changed how society views people who suffer from mental illness. Suspicion about mentally ill people is slowly giving way to compassion. Mental illnesses today are recognized as diseases of the body, just like hypertension or diabetes. Despite remarkable progress in treating psychiatric disorders, we have a very incomplete understanding of how current treatments work their magic on the brain",

In the case of drug therapy, we know with great precsion about how chemical synaptic transmission is affected. But we do not know why, in many cases, the therapeutic effect of a drug takes weeks to emerge. Even less is known about how psychosocial treatments act on the brain. In general, the answer seems to lie in adaptive changes that occur in the brain in response to treatment. We also do not know the causes of most mental disorders. It is clear that our genes either put us at risk or protect us. However, the enviroment also plays an important role. Environmental stresses before birth may contribute to schizophrenia, and those after birth may precipitate depression. Not all environmental effects are bad, however. Appropriate sensory stimulation, especially in early childhood, can apparently prduce adaptive changes that help protect us from developing mental ilnesses later in life. Psychiatric disorders and their treatment illustrate that our brains and behaviors are infl uenced by past experience, whether it is exposure to inescapable stress or to pharmacologically elevated levels of serotonin. Of course, much more subtle sensory experiences also leave their mark on the brain. In Part IV, we will explore how sensory experiences modify the brain during development and during learning.

    "chunk_text": ". By contrast, our understanding of the mechanisms by which lighting influences cognitive processes is more equivocal. The effects of light on different cognitive processes are complex. As well as the direct effects of light on alertness, indirect effects may also occur due to disrupted circadian entraiment. Despite the widespread use of disrupted LD cycles to study the role circadian rhythms on cognition, the different experimental protocols used have subtly different effects on circadian function which are not always comparable. Moreover, these protcols will also disrupt sleep and alter physiological arousal, both of which are known to modulate cognition. Studies have used different assays that are dependent on different cognitive and sensory processes, which may also contribute to their variable findings. Here, we propose that studies addressing the effects of different lighting conditions on cognitive processes must also account for their effects on circadian rhythms, sleep, and arousal if we are to fully understand the physiological basis of these responses. Keywords: learning and memory, alertness, circadian disruption, sleep disruption, melanopsin INTRODUCTION Light exerts profound effects on physiology and behavior, including entraining circadian rhythms as well as having direct effects on body temperature, melatonin, cortisol, and the cortical electroecephalogram (EEG) ( 1 – 4 ). These effects of light are of particular concern in the modern 24/7 society as inappropriate light exposure affects an increasing proportion of the populace. This includes not only shift work and jet-lag, but exposure to light at night and the effects of light emission from mobile devices, such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones ( 5 ). Extended periods of abnormal light exposure can result in circadian disruption, which has been implicated in changes in metabolism, sleep, and cognition as well as increasing the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disease ( 6 )",

    "chunk_text": ". Many studies of circadian disrution in animal models have involved exposure to abnormal light/ dark (LD) cycles ( 7 – 10 ). While these studies have been critical for understanding how circadian disruption affects different systems, the relationship between the direct effects of light and the long-term consequences of abnormal light exposure are not straightforward. Specifically, abnormal LD cycles may affect physiology via the direct effects of light as well as via its effects on the circadian system. Changes in circadian function may in turn influence sleep, which will subsequently affect additional processes. Here, we provide an overview of the mechanisms mediating photoentrainment before going on to summarize the effects of light on sleep, arousal, and cognitive processes. We then summarize the effects of circadian disruption on cognition in the context of these different mechanisms, with a particular focus on how abnormal light exposure may influence cognitive function. CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS Circadian rhythms are approximately 24 h cycles in physiology and behavior that enable an organism to predict and adapt to periodic changes in its environment. These rhythms provide a selective advantage, enabling anticipation and exploitation of prdictable changes ( 11 , 12 ). Circadian rhythms have been described in virtually all organisms, from cyanobacteria to mammals. Moreover, they have been shown to coordinate numerous aspects of physiology and behavior, influencing everything from locmotor and sleep/wake cycles to hormonal rhythms, metabolism and cognitive performance ( 13 ). Conversely, disrupted circadian rhythms impair fitness. Studies on ground squirrels with SCN lesions found that they were predated 20% more than shaoperated control animals ( 14 ), and cyanobacteria with differing circadian periods showed increased fitness when their period matches that of the prevailing LD cycle ( 15 )",

    "chunk_text": ". Due to the role of the circadian system in optimizing physiology and behavior in anticipation of predictable environmental changes, a mismatch between internal circadian time and the external LD cycle appears to be a key mechanism by which circadian disruption gives rise to negative health consequences ( 16 ). In the following section, the anatomical and molecular basis of circadian rhythms is described, along with the mechanisms by which these rhythms are entrained to the external environment. The Suprachiasmatic Nuclei (SCN) In mammals, the master circadian pacemaker is located within the paired SCN of the anterior hypothalamus. When the SCN are lesioned, animals become arrhythmic ( 17 – 19 ). Furthermore, if fetal SCN are transplanted into an SCN lesioned animal, circadian rhythms are restored ( 20 ), with a period determined by the donor animal ( 21 ). The SCN show circadian variations in electrical activity and firing rate over 24 h, with high activity duing the subjective day and low activity during the subjective night ( 22 ). Individual SCN neurons oscillate with a period of roughly 24 h when dissociated from the rest of the SCN tissue, indicating that these rhythms are generated at an intracellular level rather than occurring as an emergent network property ( 23 ). While the role of the SCN in driving circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior in mammals was established in the 1970s, it was not until the late 1990s that the molecular basis of these rhythms was established. The Molecular Circadian Clock The underlying mechanism generating intracellular circadian rhythms is a transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL) comprising positive, negative, and accessory limbs ( 24 ). The positive limb consists of the core clock proteins, CLOCK and BMAL1, which both contain a basic helix-loop-helix domain and bind together to form heterodimers. These in turn bind to E-box enhancer regions of Per1-2 and Cry1-2 genes to promote their transcription ( Figure 1 )",

    "chunk_text": ". These in turn bind to E-box enhancer regions of Per1-2 and Cry1-2 genes to promote their transcription ( Figure 1 ). The negative limb comprises the translated PER and CRY proteins which translocate back into the nucleus and directly interact with the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex to inhibit transcription. In turn, the transcription of PER and CRY proteins are reduced, and the proteins are also actively broken down, leading to re-activation of transcription by CLOCK/BMAL1. In addition to the core loop, an accessory loop is also driven by the CLOCK/BMAL1 activation. The Rev-erb α gene is transcribed and produces the orphan nuclear receptor REV-ERB α , which activates a ROR response element in the promoter of Bmal1 to inhibit its transcription. As PER and CRY interact with CLOCK/BMAL1 to inhibit transcription, Rev-erb α falls as well, disinhibiting Bmal1 transcription, alloing levels to rise again ( 25 ). CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimers also drive the transcription of a large number of other genes which contain E-box enhancers in their promoter region, termed clock controlled genes (CCGs), thus allowing the clock to influence a wide range of cellular functions ( 26 ). The characterization of the molecular basis of circadian rhythms reflects one of the best examples of how genetic mechanisms can give rise to complex behavior. Indeed, it is remarkable that changes in a single gene can give rise to changes in the period of the circadian clock, or even arrhythmicity. Light Input to the Circadian Clock A clock is of no use unless it can be set to the right time. In mamals, the master SCN clock is entrained to the external enviroment by time cues (zeitgebers), the most important of which is light detected by the eyes. Indeed, loss of the eye abolishes entrainment ( 27 , 28 ). The SCN receives input from the retina via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT), which allows the light to adjust the phase of its endogenous rhythms to match that of the environment ( 29 )",

The SCN receives input from the retina via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT), which allows the light to adjust the phase of its endogenous rhythms to match that of the environment ( 29 ). Studies on the photoreceptors mediating cicadian entrainment demonstrated that mice can still phase shift their locomotor activity rhythms and suppress pineal melatonin in response to light even in the absence of the classical rod and cone photoreceptors that mediate vision ( 30 , 31 ). These findings suggested the existence of a novel retinal photoreceptor, in addtion to the well-characterized rods and cones. It was subsequently shown that a subset of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin (OPN4) are intrinsically light sensitive and form the primary projection to the SCN ( Figure 1 ) ( 32 ). However, as pRGCs receive input from the outer retina, their output via the RHT depends upon both Figure 1 | Light is detected by the photoreceptors of the retina, including the rods and cones as well as photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs), expressing the photopigment melanopsin. Light information is relayed to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT), where it entrains an intracellular molecular clock mechanism, consisting of positive (BMAL1 and CLOCK) and negative (PER and CRY) elements. their intrinsic responses as well as extrinsic signals from rods and cones ( 33 , 34 ). As such, mice lacking melanopsin ( Opn4 − / − ) display normal circadian entrainment, but attenuated phase shifing responses to light ( 35 , 36 ). However, mice in which pRGCs are genetically lesioned are unable to entrain to light ( 37 )",

Since the identification of pRGCs, it has become clear that these cells mediate more than just circadian entrainment, and are involved in a range of non-image forming (NIF) responses to light, incluing the pupillary light response, regulation of sleep–wake timing, photophobia, light aversion, and cognitive function, as well as influencing image forming responses, such as visual adaption ( 38 ). Melanopsin-expressing pRGCs project to multiple brain targets, including the intergeniculate leaflet, olivary pretectal nucleus, medial amygdala, lateral habenula, and superior colliclus, suggesting that different NIF responses may involve different neural projections ( 38 , 39 ). The primary neurotransmitters of the RHT are glutamate and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide, which are released at synapses in the SCN in response to photic stimuli ( 40 , 41 ). This results in increases in calcium concentration and firing rates in SCN neurons. Increased calcium concentration activates intracellular signaling pathways [e.g., cyclic AMP (cAMP) and PKA], converging on the phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein, which translocates to the nucleus, binding to cAMP response elements in the promoters of Per1 and Per2 , increasing their transcription. This results in the molecular clock in SCN being either advanced or delayed. Although this link between light input, membrane events, and the TTFL has been characterized, the mechanisms by which the TTFL regulates membrane potential are poorly understood ( 3 , 42 ). While great progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis of photoentrainment, this model is almost certain to be incomplete",

Clock Outputs and Peripheral Clocks The SCN has widespread projections throughout the brain, including to the septum, the anterior paraventricular thalmus, and to multiple hypothalamic nuclei including the suparaventricular zone, ventromedial hypothalamus, dorsomedial hypothalamus, and pre-optic area ( 43 ). The SCN also projects to the paraventricular nucleus, whereby it modulates circadian rhythms in neuroendocrine and autonomic function ( 44 , 45 ). Furthermore, molecular circadian rhythms are not confined to the SCN. Studies in the late 1990s showed that rat fibroblasts, which had been cultured for 30 years, were capable of rhythmic clock gene expression following a serum shock ( 46 ). Furthermore, clock gene reporter studies demonstrated that tissues throughout the body displayed rhythmic clock gene expression, including the liver and adrenal glands ( 47 ). These peripheral clocks are thought to play a key role in regulating local tissue physiology ( 48 ), with the SCN coordinating circadian timing throughout the body via a combination of neural, paracrine, hormonal, and behavioral signals. The identification of peripheral clocks throughout the body led to a fundamental change in our undestanding of circadian rhythms, demonstrating that temporal organization is embedded in the physiology of virtually all cells, tissues, and organs. Figure 2 | Sleep is regulated by two interacting processes. (A) A homeostatic mechanism (Process S) increases the requirement for sleep with prolonged waking and dissipates during sleep. (B) A circadian mechanism (Process C) provides a drive for wakefulness at specific phases of the 24 h cycle ( 49 ). SLEEP The sleep/wake cycle is perhaps the most familiar consequence of our circadian rhythms. While sleep is modulated by the circadian system, it is also critically regulated by a homeostatic drive that increases with extended waking",

As such, sleep and wakefuness depend upon the interaction between these circadian and homeostatic processes ( 49 , 50 ). Sleep is a complex process involing multiple brain regions and a network of mutually inhibiting arousal and sleep-promoting neurons ( 51 – 53 ). This involves wake active nuclei in the brainstem, hypothalamus, and the basal forebrain that fire during waking, and become less active during both NREM and REM sleep. Sleep can be defined in both behavioral and physiological terms. Behaviorally, it involves a period of extended inactivity, with increased arousal threshold, a species-specific body posture and a typical sleep site ( 54 ). Physiologically, sleep is defined by the EEG, which measures electrical activity at the level of the cortex. During sleep, well-characterized changes occur in the EEG, classified as rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep and norapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep ( 55 ). NREM sleep involves synchronized rhythmic EEG activity, occurring widely over the cortex, reflecting changes in the firing pattern of cortical neurons. By contrast, REM sleep is characterized by an EEG similar to the awake state, but with atonia and REMs ( 56 ). The brain cycles through these stages several times through the night in humans (in rodents, many more such cycles occur), with higher levels of NREM sleep at the start of the night, and higher REM sleep occurring later. While the precise function of sleep is not fully understood, it is likely it subserves multiple functions, including metabolite clearance, memory processing, immune restoration, and other functions ( 57 ). Deprivation of sleep has many negative consequences, including cognitive impairment ( 58 ), metabolic dysregulation ( 59 ), and following extended sleep deprivation, eventually death ( 60 )",

These processes interact to produce periods of wake and sleep during the day ( Figure 2 ). This conceptual model has been useful in interpreting disturbances of sleep/wake regulation, and has been validated by quantitative predictions ( 61 – 63 ). The homeostatic process gradually accmulates during prior wakefulness, and dissipates during sleep. This process is highly correlated with the power of slow wave activity (SWA) on the EEG during NREM sleep, characterized by frequencies in the 0.5–4 Hz range ( 64 ). The mechanisms undelying this homeostatic process are unclear. However, a number of putative sleep factors build up in the brain during prolonged wakefulness and dissipate during sleep and these may mediate the homeostatic process ( 65 ). Perhaps the best known example is adenosine, which increases in the basal forebrain during wake and dissipates during sleep, and has been proposed to account for the action of adenosinergic drugs, such as caffeine, on sleep ( 66 , 67 ). The circadian process varies throughout the 24 h day, allowing wake and sleep at alternate phases of the cycle ( 68 ). The primary driver of the circadian process is thought to be the SCN, as following SCN lesions endogenous rhythms in rest/activity are abolished, but the homeostatic regulation of sleep remains intact ( 69 – 71 ). The SCN appears to primarily provide a wake-promoting signal during the active period as lesions increase the total amount of sleep time ( 72 )",

Studies in which internal desynchrony is induced in rats using 22 h days have also shown that rhythms in NREM sleep can be dissociated from rhythms in body temperature and REM sleep ( 73 ). More specifically, the circadian timing of REM sleep has been shown to be associated with clock gene expression in the dorsomedial SCN ( 74 ). The SCN likely mediates process C via direct and indirect projections to hypothalamic and brainstem nuclei (including locus coeruleus, VLPO, and orexin neurons), which control levels of arousal and sleep ( 75 , 76 ). The ventral subparaventricular zone appears to be a key node in this patway, as lesions of this nucleus result in profound reduction in rhythms of locomotor activity and sleep ( 77 ). Together, the homeostatic and circadian processes determine the timing of sleep and wake, and disturbance of either process has the potential to disrupt sleep and influence subsequent waking performance. Direct Effects of Light on Sleep In addition to the role of homeostatic and circadian processes in the regulation of sleep, light exposure also directly modulates sleep. While light increases arousal and alertness in diurnal species such as humans, it promotes sleep in nocturnal rodents. Studies in rats have shown that light exposure suppresses actiity and results in increased sleep, whereas darkness results in increased wakefulness ( 49 , 78 ). One of the many projections of melanopsin pRGCs is to the sleep-promoting VLPO ( 39 ). This observation, coupled with the role of melanopsin pRGCs in the regulation of numerous NIF responses to light, led to studies of acute sleep induction in mice lacking melanopsin ( Opn4 − / − )",

This observation, coupled with the role of melanopsin pRGCs in the regulation of numerous NIF responses to light, led to studies of acute sleep induction in mice lacking melanopsin ( Opn4 − / − ). Initial studies suggested that melanopsin-deficient mice show impaired sleep induction in response to nocturnal light exposure, suggesting that melanopsin plays a key role in mediating sleep induction and maintenance in response to light ( 79 – 82 ). However, these findings were not consistent with data showing that nocturnal light exposure in rodents produces a rise in plasma corticosterone ( 83 ), and that these effects on adrenal corticosterone are via the SCN, but independent of effects on the clock ( 84 ). Recent studies using different wavelengths of light have shown that short-wavelength 470 nm (blue) light results in delayed sleep onset, coupled with behavioral light aversion and elevated plasma corticosterone, and that this arousal response is attenuated in melanopsin-deficient mice. By contrast, longer wavelength 530 nm (green) light of the same intensity resulted in reduced arousal responses and more rapid sleep induction. Consistent with previous studies, sleep induction in response to green light was attenuated in melanopsin-deficient mice ( 85 ). These data are consistent with recent data using chemogenetic activation of pRGCs that produce behavioral arousal, rather than sleep ( 86 ). Furthermore, these findings are also consistent with the alerting effects of light described in humans (see Direct Effects of Light on Cognitive Processes). The finding that melanopsin may be involved in the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system and subsequent arousal is pehaps not surprising, as pRGCs provide a major input to the SCN which is known to regulate sympathetic function. Indeed, this is the primary pathway via which pineal melatonin synthesis is regulated ( 87 ). By contrast, explaining why melanopsin-deficient animals show impaired sleep induction in response to light is more challenging",

One potential explanation is that melanosin has recently been shown to be involved in light adaptation ( 88 ). If rod/cone signaling normally mediates sleep induction, in the absence of melanopsin responses to bright light stimuli may quickly saturate leading to impaired responses compared to wild-type mice ( 85 ). Rather than impaired photic input, an alternative explanation is that the impaired sleep induction in melanopsin-deficient mice may simply reflect a reduced requirment for sleep. Support for this hypothesis comes from data from melanopsin knockout mice showing reduced delta power during the dark phase as well as reduced accumulation of delta power following sleep deprivation. These findings suggest that the need for sleep increases at a slower rate in melanopsin-deficient mice ( 82 ). If this is indeed the case, it would suggest that differences in homeostatic sleep could account for impaired sleep induction in melanopsin-deficient mice, rather than deficits in light input to the VLPO as has previously been suggested. Additional experimental variables may influence sleep indution in response to light. The environmental context is almost certain to influence acute sleep induction, as light exposure in the home cage may produce quite different effects on sleep in comparison to a novel environment. For example, in novel environments, such as an open field or novel object testing arena, sleep induction is not observed in response to light ( 89 , 90 ). In addition, it should also be considered that while c-Fos has been used as a marker of VLPO activation during sleep ( 91 ), induction of Fos in response to light may simply reflect the subsequent sleep/ wake status of the animal rather than providing a marker of light input as has been widely used in the SCN ( 92 )",

While there is a limited retinohypothalamic projection from melanopsin pRGCs to the VLPO ( 39 , 93 , 94 ), it is quite possible that the direct effects of light on sleep may be mediated via other neural pathways. In summary, as well as circadian and homeostatic processes, light can also directly modulate sleep. However, future studies are required to understand how circadian and homeostatic processes interact to influence acute sleep induction in response to light, as well as the detailed neural pathways involved. These direct effects of light on sleep, and conversely alertness, are clearly important for the effects of light on cognitive processes. COGNITION Given the widespread influence of the circadian system across multiple aspects of physiology and behavior, it is not surprising that cognitive processes also display circadian rhythms. While learning and memory provide easily testable and translatable paradigms in both human and animal models, several other processes such as attention, mood, and reaction time also show circadian variation ( 95 ). As such, the influence of light and cicadian rhythms on cognition are unlikely to be due to effects on a single process. Circadian Regulation of Cognitive Processes In humans, cognitive function shows variation over the 24 h day, starting off low in the morning, maintaining high levels until habitual bedtime, apart from a dip in the afternoon. This pattern is related to both sleep and circadian processes. Forced desynchrony, in which subjects are exposed to a light schedule to which they are unable to entrain, have been used to investigate the role of circadian and homeostatic regulation of cognitive processes, such as alertness, vigilance, working memory, sleepness, and mood. These studies show circadian rhythms in all of these different cognitive processes, which also decline with time awake ( 96 , 97 ). Again, data from animal studies are less conclusive",

Again, data from animal studies are less conclusive. Some studies report increased performance during the subjective night in aversive ( 98 ) and appetitive tasks ( 99 , 100 ), whereas others found better performance during the subjective day ( 89 , 101 , 102 ). These contradictory findings may reflect the nature of the behavioral tasks employed. Originally, it was shown that rodents performed best on behavioral tasks when training and testing times were matched, which may reflect state/context dependent learning ( 103 , 104 ). To date, a major limitation of circadian stuies of different cognitive processes is that while circadian time is carefully controlled, the preceding sleep/wake status of the animal is rarely considered. In summary, processes such as learning and memory certainly appear to be under circadian control to some extent, and this circadian regulation has the potential to influence the effects of light on cognition. Direct Effects of Light on Cognitive Processes Human studies have demonstrated an important role of light in the regulation of alertness. Imaging studies have also shown that light exposure can influence cortical and subcortical networks involved in cognitive processes, such as attention, arousal, and memory ( 105 – 110 ). In addition, a number of studies have shown that short-wavelength light (470 nm or lower) is associated with the increased suppression of melatonin, reduction in subjective sleepiness, reduced reaction times and changes in EEG power in the delta–theta frequency range ( 111 , 112 ). These findings are consistent with recent studies on the effects of light-emitting devices on subjective alertness, EEG and sleep latency ( 113 )",

The primary cognitive effects of light on appear to be via increased alertness—which is typically measured using subjective rating scales as well as tests of sustained attention such as the psychmotor vigilance task, a simple reaction time task. Overall, these studies suggest an increase in subjective ratings of alertness in response to light, though whether these findings always translate into increased cognitive performance is less clear ( 114 – 116 ). However, in cognitive tasks where sustained attention is necesary, light may be expected to exert greater effects. Despite the wealth of human studies on the acute effects of light on alertness, remarkably few animal studies have investigated the effects of light on cognitive performance. Studies on the acoustic startle response in rats have shown that this response is enhanced by increasing light exposure ( 117 ). Subsequent studies investgated the effects of light on tone-cued fear conditioning, finding that light enhances freezing responses in wild-type mice ( 118 ). Short pulses of white light at night in mice have been shown to improve consolidation of contextual fear learning and long-term potentiation ( 119 ). Under other conditions, bright light exposure impaired spatial navigation performance on a water maze task in BALB/c mice, which was associated with increased anxiety and elevated corticosterone levels ( 120 ). Most recently, studies on spontaneous object recognition show that bright light during the test phase impairs recognition performance, regardless of the light level during the sample phase [although see Ref. ( 121 )]. These effects on recognition memory are abolished in both mice lacking rods/cones as well as in mice lacking melanopsin, suggesting that integrated responses from both systems mediate the effects of light on performance ( 90 , 118 )",

Light may also influence emotional processes such as mood, and recent studies using aberrant LD cycles have shown that these may give rise to depression-like behaviors ( 122 ) (see T-Cycles). These data add a further complexity to the effects of light, which may involve circadian and non-circadian effects ( 9 , 123 ). In summary, data from humans show clear effects of light on alertness, and in some cases, also on performance in tests of sustained attention. However, despite a number of rodent studies exploring the effects of light on different cognitive processes, no consistent effects have emerged. Light may certainly affect the outcome of laboratory tests of learning and memory in rodents. However, the direction and amplitude of any effect may depend on the nature of the test and the different cognitive processes involved. The difficulty of characterizing mechanisms in human studies, combined with the lack of consistent effects in animal models, has led to a lack of any detailed understanding of the photoreceptor contributions and underlying neural pathways involved in such responses. Sleep and Cognitive Processes Given the key role of the circadian system in the regulation of sleep, any disruption of the circadian system is likely to influence subsequent sleep/wake timing. Sleep has been suggested to play a role in cognitive performance ( 124 ), and sleep disruption is known to impair multiple aspects of cognition, including arousal, attention, and working memory ( 125 ). As such, the effects of sleep disruption must also be taken into account when consideing the effects of light on cognitive processes, particularly where circadian function is affected. In rodents, sleep deprivation influences several aspects of memory, which have been assessed using a variety of behavioral tests. Total sleep deprivation in the first 5 h after training has been reported to reduce contextual fear memory, despite otherwise adequate sleep ( 126 – 129 ), but produce no effect on tone-cued fear memories ( 126 )",

Using the platform-over-water REM sleep deprivation method, contextual fear memory has been suggested to be impaired, again with no effect on tone-cued fear memories ( 130 – 133 ). Spontaneous object recognition is a highly tractable test of learning and memory in rodents ( 134 , 135 ) that has also been widely used to study the role of sleep in learning and memory. Studies have shown that both object-recognition and objeclocation memories are impaired by 5–6 h of sleep deprivation after training ( 136 – 139 ), with an apparently crucial window at 3–4 h ( 140 ). Another test that has been used to study the effects of sleep deprivation is the Morris watermaze, which relies on aversive immersion in water to motivate animals to find a hidden platform. While this requires spatial learning and is sensitive to hippocampal damage, other brain regions and strategies are also important ( 141 ). 4 h of selective REM sleep deprivation immediately following training has been suggested to impair performance ( 142 ). However, this finding is equivocal with some studies agreeing ( 143 – 145 ) and others disagreeing with the results ( 146 ). This may be due to differences between protocols favoring different search strategies and/or brain areas. Spontaneous spatial recognition in the Y-maze has also been studied following sleep deprivation. Similar to other behavioral paradigms, performance is impaired by 12 h total sleep deprivation prior to training ( 147 ). In addition to sleep duration, sleep architecture is also impotant for memory. Humans sleep in a consolidated bout once a day and progress through many cycles of REM and NREM sleep during the night. If this is fragmented, daytime function is impaired and increased sleepiness occurs ( 148 ). By contrast, rodents sleep in multiple short bouts, consisting of both REM Figure 3 | The relationship between arousal and cognitive performance.

(A) Under normal low arousal conditions, performance may be better at circadian time A versus circadian time B. (B) However, under conditions of high arousal, these circadian time-dependent effects may result in better performance at time B versus time A, due to excessive arousal. and NREM sleep, throughout the day and night, with a greater amount of sleep during the light phase, primarily due to increased length of sleep bouts during the day ( 149 ). Disturbing sleep architecture with regular waking prevents normal completion of sleep bouts, resulting in increased sleep pressure despite no change to the total sleep duration ( 150 ). Sleep fragmentation also impacts cognitive processes. Mice subjected to sleep fragmenttion for 15 days, induced by being disturbed by a bar across the cage every 2 min, have poor learning and retention in the Morris watermaze ( 151 ). Similarly, optogenetic activation of hypocretin neurons fragments sleep without altering total sleep time, and when fragmented in the first 4 h following training, causes deficits in object-recognition memory ( 152 ). Importantly these studies suggest that even when sleep timing and total sleep duration may remain comparable, fragmented sleep can give rise to impaired performance in specific cognitive processes. Together the data described above suggest that sleep disruption impairs specific aspects of learning and memory. However, these effects are not straightforward, with sleep deprivation, selective REM deprivation and sleep fragmentation having subtly different effects on different behavioral tests. Some of the cognitive deficits that occur as a result of sleep loss may arise as a result in specific changes in synaptic function, particularly relating to glutamategic signaling and synaptic plasticity",

The GluA1 subunit is important in both AMPA receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity ( 153 – 155 ). Critically, GluA1 levels in synaptoneurosomes in both the cortex and hippocampus have been shown to be elevated following prolonged wakefuness ( 156 ). This supports the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis, whereby wakefulness is associated with a net increase in synaptic strength, which is subsequently renormalized during sleep ( 157 ). Data from mice lacking GluA1 may provide some insight into the consequences of these changes in synaptic plasticity that occurs during sleep. GluA1-deficient mice show unimpaired performance on associative, long-term memory tasks, such as the Morris watermaze. By contrast, these animals show selective deficits in short-term habituation to recently experienced stimuli ( 158 , 159 ). These findings suggest that during waking synaptic GluA1 levels increase, reflecting an ongoing habituation and reduction in attention. This hypothesis suggests that sleep may be important for the restoration of attentional performance ( 160 ). In conclusion, while the disruption of sleep undoubtedly inflences cognitive function, the specific cognitive processes affected and the underlying mechanisms involved are not straightforward. However, when considering the effects of light—either directly or via its effects on the circadian system—researchers should always be aware that effects on cognition could arise due to a concomitant disruption of sleep. Effects of Arousal on Cognitive Processes Arousal is another key factor that may influence the outcome of studies on cognition. In this context, rather than simply being awake, arousal refers to a state of physiological alertness resulting in increased attention and cortical activity, along with changes in motivation and emotional state. Again, light may modulate arousal either directly, or indirectly via the circadian modulation of arousal",

Arousal responses are thought to be mediated via prjections from the SCN to the dorsomedial hypothalamus which are then relayed to the ascending arousal system, including the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, cholinergic laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, dopaminergic ventral tegmental area and serotoninergic raphe nuclei ( 75 ). In addition, the widespread projections of the melanopsin pRGCs may also be important in the effects of light on arousal, including the lateral habenula, medial amygdala, and subparaventricular zone ( 9 , 39 ). In addition to the regulation of the ascending arousal system, physiological arousal may also be accompanied by increased activity of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system, resulting in widespread changes in physiology, particularly relating to cardiovascular and adrenal function. Whether these effects of light on arousal are indepenent or interrelated remains unclear. The relationship between arousal and cognitive performance is complicated. Yerkes and Dodson ( 161 ) reported that with simple learning tasks there was a positive linear relationship between arousal and performance (i.e., the higher the level of arousal, the better the task performance). However, as the difficult of the task increased, an inverted-U shaped relationship between arousal and cognitive performance was observed, with optimal performance requiring an optimal level of arousal ( 161 ). As such, rhythms in arousal will influence where an individual sits on the arousal-performance curve, and are likely to contribute to the rhythms seen in behavioral performance in animal studies. As a result of the differences in baseline arousal, the response to stressors such as handling, restraint, and environmental noise will differ ( 162 , 163 )",

When baseline arousal is low, increased arousal may be expected to result in improved performance, but when baseline arousal is high, increasing arousal further may impair performance ( Figure 3 ). The circadian control of adrenal glucocorticoids via the classical hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis is well known ( 164 , 165 ). As well as the circadian regulation of adrenal glucocorticoids, light has also been shown to directly modulate glucocorticoid release ( 83 ), and may also exert different effects on arousal depending upon wavelength ( 85 ). This acute response to light does not involve the classic HPA axis, instead relying upon modulation of the sympathetic nervous system ( 83 ). While trasient increases in glucocorticoids in response to stressors—such as light exposure—are a normal physiological response (termed “allostasis”), long-term exposure to such stimuli can result in fundamentally different responses (“negative allostasis”) ( 166 ). Such chronic stress increases baseline glucocorticoid levels and attenuates the amplitude of glucocorticoid rhythms, both at an ultradian and circadian level ( 164 , 167 ). Elevated glucocorticoid levels are known to affect cognitive processes, such as learning and memory ( 168 ). As well as changes in plasma glucocorticoid levels, cardiovascular markers such as heart rate may provide useful markers of arousal. Furthermore, it has recently been sugested that spontaneous fluctuations in locomotor activity may provide a useful marker of generalized arousal ( 169 , 170 ), which may be beneficial for future studies in this field",

Given the role of the circadian clock in regulating the ascening arousal system as well as the autonomic nervous system, as well as the direct effects of light on these systems, changes in arousal state should also be considered when investigating the effects of light on cognitive processes. CIRCADIAN DISRUPTION The circadian system has evolved to enable organisms to anticpate and exploit predictable changes in the external environment, optimizing physiology and behavior to specific times of day. However, our modern 24/7 society produces numerous examples where lifestyle is in conflict with our internal biological clocks, including shift work and jet-lag. Moreover, artificial light results in light exposure at inappropriate times of day, including light at night as well as exposure to light from mobile devices, such as phones, tablet, and computers. As a result, there is growing concern regarding the consequences of circadian disruption and aberrant light exposure on human health, including effects on metabolism, cardiovascular function, mental health, and even cancer risk ( 6 , 16 , 171 ). Those routinely exposed to such condtions may develop problems with poor performance, insomnia, emotional disturbances, and gastrointestinal complaints. Such symptoms are thought to affect 5–10% of those involved in shift work. Treatments seek to realign the internal clock with the extenal environment, using scheduled light exposure (or avoidance), short naps, or use of pharmacological interventions, such as melatonin, caffeine, or even prescription drugs ( 172 , 173 ). With our increasing exposure to artificial light sources, such problems look likely to rise in the future. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the adverse health outcomes of circadian disruption, an increasing number of stuies have investigated the effects of aberrant light exposure on cognitive function, using rodents housed under abnormal LD cycles.

    "chunk_text": ". However, such abnormal LD cycles may exert their effects via different mechanisms. Some result in light exposure during the normal subjective night, whereas others result in a mismatch between internal circadian time and external environmental time, requiring a constant phase adjustment. It has been suggested that this mismatch may be the basis of the negative consequences of circadian disruption ( 16 ). Evidence for this comes from studies in which animals show impaired health under non-24 h enviromental conditions ( 16 ). Perhaps the best evidence comes from studies on longevity, where wild-type mice show reduced lifespan under non-24 h LD cycles ( 174 ), and tau mutant hamsters show impaired longevity under 24 h conditions, but normal longeity in constant darkness ( 175 , 176 ). These studies indicate that a circadian clock is only beneficial if its period matches to that of the environment. An alternative hypothesis for the adverse effects of circadian disruption is that such conditions result in internal desynchrony—where circadian clocks in different tissues (or even different brain regions) may become misaligned or even arrhythmic, resulting in impaired performance ( 96 ). Internal desynchrony has been described as a result of scheduled feeding in mice, resulting in desynchrony between clocks in the SCN and hippocampus and impaired learning and memory [( 177 ); eLife], as well as within neuronal subpopulations of the SCN in rats housed under 22 h T cycles, resulting in depression-like behavior ( 178 ). The mismatch between internal and external time and internal desynchrony are not mutually exclusive hypotheses, and may both contribute to the negative effects of circadian disruption. Abnormal LD cycle protocols used to study circadian disrution include constant light (LL), jet-lag, T cycles, dim light at night and disruptive phase shifts (DPSs)",

The effects of these protocols are summarized in Table 1 and described in detail below with regard to their known effects on circadian physiology, sleep, arousal, and cognitive processes. Constant Light Constant conditions are frequently used in circadian research to study free-running circadian rhythms. While constant darkness allows animals to organize their behavior exclusively according to their internal circadian clock, constant light has been used to study light input as well as a means of producing circadian disruption. Circadian Constant light results in an intensity-dependent lengthening of the period of nocturnal animals, and can cause complete arrhythmia ( 179 , 180 ). Both the molecular and electrophysiologcal timekeeping of the SCN is altered. Long-term constant light exposure leads to constitutively higher levels of mPER2 ( 181 ), and clock gene rhythms become gradually desynchronized ( 182 ). At an electrophysiological level, as well as period lengthening, the amplitude of SCN firing is reduced and firing rate is more varable ( 183 ). Peripheral clocks have also been shown to be affected, resulting in dampened amplitude and broadened peak phases ( 184 ), comparable with SCN lesions ( 185 ). Sleep Since constant light alters circadian activity, it will also affect sleep distribution. However, we are aware of no detailed characteriztion of the effects of constant light on the amount, distribution, and architecture of sleep.

This plays a key role in glucocorticoid signaling, but is only detectable using high-resolution sampling ( 192 ). Cognitive Effects Constant light has been suggested to impair spatial memory in the Morris watermaze, as well as in contextual fear memory and passive avoidance ( 193 – 197 ). However, longer durations (5–7 weeks) of constant light produce no change in a plus-maze discriminative avoidance task ( 198 ). Interval timing has also been reported to be disrupted by constant light ( 199 ). Recent studies using repeated constant light on different aspects of recognition memory have shown a dampening of SCN clock gene rhythms, resulting in desynchrony between clocks in the SCN, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb ( 89 ). As described above, constant light may cause period lengthening and in some cases arrhythmia. However, to date, no studies have related the effects of constant light on cognition to these different circadian effects. In summary, constant light leads to a lengthening of circadian period or even arrhythmicity, with potential effects on the copling of central and peripheral clocks. Such conditions have been shown to influence arousal and cognitive processes, though these effects are not consistent between studies. Jet Lag Shifting the LD cycle under which animals are housed has been used to mimic the sudden shift in time-zones produced by jet-lag. Acute jet-lag protocols typically involve a single advance or delay in the LD cycle. In addition, chronic jet-lag—involving repeated shifts of the LD cycle—has also been used as a model of circadian disruption. Circadian In response to acute jet-lag, rodents typically shift their activity over several days to re-entrain to the new LD cycle. Usually this involves an advance of the LD cycle so that activity onset can be easily determined",

Delaying the LD cycle results in suppresion of activity by light (negative masking), making the activity onset more difficult to determine. In response to a 6 h advance of the LD cycle, mice shift their activity by ~1 h per day, typically taking 5–6 days to re-entrain. However, patterns of gene expresion in the SCN may change more rapidly ( 200 ). Peripheral clocks shift at different rates, potentially leading to a differing phase relationship with the SCN while they re-align ( 200 , 201 ). Chronic jet-lag protocols result in the animal having to repeaedly re-entrain to the shifting environment LD cycle, and may alter the relationship between the SCN and other peripheral circadian oscillators. Sleep Acute jet-lag has been reported to result in no change in total sleep time, but mild changes to the distribution of sleep ( 202 ). However, under chronic jet-lag, sleep is both fragmented and reduced by ~10% per week compared with baseline conditions. While no increase in SWA was reported following chronic jelag, an increase in REM sleep and brief arousals was described ( 203 , 204 ). Arousal The stress axis is markedly affected by acute jet-lag, enhancing the magnitude of the stress-evoked corticosterone response ( 202 ). With chronic jet-lag, baseline corticosterone as well as anxiety and depression-like behaviors have been reported to be unaffected ( 204 ). Cognitive Acute jet-lag impairs spatial memory, whether performed before or after initial training ( 10 , 194 , 202 , 205 , 206 ), with deficits pesisting after re-entrainment ( 202 , 206 ). Interval timing has been reported to be less accurate after the shift but returns to normal with full behavioral re-entrainment ( 199 ). Other tasks, such as a sustained attention task ( 100 ) and social memory ( 207 ), are unafected by acute jetlag",

Several behavioral tasks show impairment after chronic jet-lag, including conditioned place preference ( 208 , 209 ), a 8-arm radial arm task ( 210 ), and the Morris watermaze ( 210 , 211 ). Access to a running wheel has been suggested to mitigate some of these effects ( 210 ). Finally, fear memory to both tone and context are unimpaired after chronic jet-lag ( 202 , 211 ). Together, these data suggest that circadian disruption induced using both acute and chronic jet-lag protocols result in specific changes in cognitive processes. However, given the influence of these protocols on both sleep fragmentation as well as arousal, it is difficult to ascertain the mechanisms by which cognitive processes are affected. T-Cycles As the circadian clock is not exactly 24 h, it is adjusted on a daily basis by the prevailing LD cycle. This entrainment process can be challenged using LD cycles whose length differs from 24 h – termed “T cycles”. A range of different T cycles have been used, where T refers to the day length. For example, an 11 h light, 11 h dark LD cycle is referred to as T22. Circadian The process of entrainment is limited and can only occur over a relatively narrow range—typically 23–25 h in mammals. Under short T cycles, the animal has to constantly accelerate its internal clock; whereas under long T cycles, the internal clock must be decelerated. As a result, the phasing of activity relative to the LD cycle may also change. Outside the range of entrainment animals will show a non-entrained period ~24 h despite the prevailing LD cycle. A second period corresponding to the period of the LD cycles may also occur. Rhythms in different aspects of physiology and behavior may correspond to the period of the LD cycle or the ~24 h period ( 212 )",

T cycles have been used to study the negative consequences of circadian disruption on healthy physiology in humans, including effects on cognitive performance ( 97 , 213 ). However, it should be noted that the T cycle studies performed in nocturnal rodents often differ from the classical forced desychrony protocols used in human subjects. As animal studies often use higher light levels, animals are periodically exposed to reltively bright stimuli. This results in repeated phase shifting, and as the phase response curve of nocturnal rodents largely results in delays, this produces a non-entrained period which is slightly longer than the normal free-running period ( 214 , 215 ). Sleep Studies on rats under 22 h days result in desynchrony with anmals showing both 22 and > 24 h rhythms in activity, sleep/wake, and NREM sleep. However, rhythms of core body temperature and REM sleep were desynchronized and predominantly cycled with a period > 24 h ( 73 ). Studies using extreme T7 cycles report that total sleep levels and sleep distribution were unaffected ( 122 ). However, recent studies using spectral analysis of EEG signals from mice under 20- to 22 h T cycles show that these conditions result in higher SWA during sleep, as well as changes in the power of theta and gamma frequencies during waking ( 216 ). Arousal Plasma corticosterone has been reported to be rhythmic but elevated under T7 cycles ( 122 ). Cognitive 22 h T cycles have been reported to impair passive avoidance memory but exert no effect on recognition memory ( 217 ).

As different aspects of physiology and behavior may devolve to the period of the LD cycle or the period of the circadian clock, this can give rise to internal desynchrony. Moreover, T cycles can result in a dynamically changing relatioship between internal biological time and the external LD cycle. When out of phase, physiology and behavior may be dramatically affected, whereas when re-aligned they may appear relatively normal. As shown by recent data on sleep, the disruption of sleep/ wake timing that results from housing under long-term T cycles can result in increased homeostatic sleep pressure and consquences for subsequent waking behavior ( 216 ). In conclusion, while T cycles provide valuable experimental tools for studying the relationships between biological clocks and the light enviroment, effects on sleep and arousal must also be considered when subsequently studying cognitive processes. Dim Light at Night Due to the widespread adoption of artificial light, nocturnal light exposure is increasingly common. To study the physiological consequences of light exposure during the dark phase, protocols have been used in which animals are exposed to light during their normal dark (active) phase. Circadian Dim light at night has been shown to reduce locomotor activity levels, with no change in daytime activity ( 218 , 219 ). Periodogram power was found to be reduced, and rhythms of PER1 and PER2 immunoreactivity in the SCN were found to be blunted ( 218 ). Sleep Data suggest that dim light at night does not affect sleep in mice, with no changes in either sleep timing or SWA ( 220 ). However, studies in rats report a decreased amplitude of daily rhythms of REM and NREM sleep as well as specific changes in the NREM EEG spectra around 16–19 Hz ( 221 )",

Arousal Rhythms of corticosterone were found to be blunted under dim light at night conditions ( 218 ). Cognitive Initial studies of light at night often involved exposure to constant light (LL), but with the provision of an opaque tube to provide an escape to minimize any effects related to stress/arousal. Under such conditions, mice show increased anxiety (elevated plus maze and open field tests) and increased depression-like behaviors (forced swim test and sucrose anhedonia) ( 187 ). In hamsters, similar depression-like behaviors were also observed under light/dim light cycles, in which animals were housed under 150 lux during the day but 5 lux during the night (rather than complete darkness). By contrast, anxiety responses were reduced in hamsters housed under these conditions ( 222 ). The effects of dim light at night have been reported to be wavelength depenent, with blue-enriched dim light at night having greater effects than red-enriched light ( 219 ). Studies in a diurnal rodent, the Nile grass rat, showed similar depression-like effects of dim light at night, coupled with impaired learning and memory, assessed using the Barnes maze ( 223 ). Depression-like responses were increased in mice under dim light at night conditions, though the previously described effects on learning and memory were not detected ( 224 ). In summary, dim light at night protocols provide another alternative approach to studying the effects of circadian disrution, producing effects on anxiety and depression-like behavior, with more subtle effects on sleep. However, the effects of these protocols on cognitive processes are more limited, and effects on learning and memory are not observed in mice, suggesting species differences may exist",

However, the effects of these protocols on cognitive processes are more limited, and effects on learning and memory are not observed in mice, suggesting species differences may exist. Differences in the physiological and behavioral effects of dim light at night compared to other circadian disruption protocols may provide insight into the diferent pathways by which aberrant lighting influences physiology and behavior. For example, the effects of dim light at night on anxiety and depression-like behaviors with blunted corticosteone rhythms appear qualitatively different from the effects on learning and memory with disrupted sleep and elevated arousal that accompany jet-lag and T cycle conditions. Disruptive Phase Shift A final protocol that has been used to study circadian disruption in Siberian hamsters ( Phodopus sungorus ) is the use of DPSs. Circadian Hamsters show phase shifting responses similar to other noctunal rodents, with light exposure during the early subjective night giving rise to phase delays in activity and light exposure during the late subjective night producing phase advances. However, when Siberian hamsters were housed under 16:8 LD cycles then exposed to a combination of two 15-min light pulses, the first advancing and a second delaying light pulse the following day, this led to a compression of activity and long-term arrhythmicity in the majority of animals. Rhythms in activity, body temperature, and melatonin were all affected, and hamsters remained arrhytmic even when subsequently exposed to normal LD cycles ( 225 ). Studies using a 2 h advancing light pulse followed by a 3 h phase delay in the LD cycle produced similar irreversible arrhythmia within a few days, and these effects were associated with redutions in clock gene expression in the SCN ( 226 ).

In arrhythmic hamsters, the usual difference between sleep during the light and dark was no longer apparent, with high levels of daytime sleep. Arrhythmic animals also show an increase of around 1.5 h of sleep per day compared with rhythmic controls. No differences in sleep homeostasis were detected ( 227 ). Arousal While we were unable to find any studies on adrenal glucocortcoids under these conditions, given the effects of DPS protocols on other aspects of circadian and neuroendocrine function, it is expected that normal rhythmic glucocorticoid rhythms will be abolished. Cognitive Novel object recognition in hamsters shows a circadian rhythm, with increased performance during the subjective night. However, these rhythms were found to be impaired in arrhythmic hamsters ( 228 ). Subsequent studies showed that DPS-induced arrhythmicity resulted in impaired novel object recognition and spontaneous alternation. By contrast, SCN lesioned animals showed no impairments in these tasks. Surprisingly, if DPtreated hamsters were SCN lesioned, their impaired performance was reversed, despite the animals remaining arrhythmic. These findings suggest that the SCN may influence memory via inhibtory output, which impairs performance when SCN function is compromised ( 229 ). Disruptive phase shift protocols have provided a valuable cotribution to the understanding of the role of circadian rhythms in the regulation of learning and memory. Although these effects are species specific, they provide an important alternative arrhytmic model to SCN lesioning or clock gene knockouts that are commonly studied in mice. Due to its profound effects, the DPS hamster model provides a better model of arrhythmia rather than circadian disruption due to aberrant light exposure",

FUTURE PERSPECTIVES Advances in our understanding of the photoreceptors mediating the effects of light on physiology and behavior have provided a greater appreciation of how different systems may interact to regulate complex downstream processes, such as cognition. However, this highlights the need for multiple physiological systems, including circadian rhythms, sleep, and arousal, all to be considered when interpreting the effects of any intervention on such complex behavioral outcomes. Despite the number of studies of circadian rhythms in learning and memory, the effects of preceding sleep at different circadian times is typically not considered. In turn, when sleep is studied, circadian processes are often overlooked. Coupled to these issues, arousal state is Figure 4 | Framework to describe the interactions between circadian rhythms, sleep, and cognition. Light exerts direct effects on the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), which in turn modulates other rhythmic processes throughout the body, including independent oscillators found in other brain regions. The SCN clock also modulates sleep, and regulates arousal via output to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system. Light may also directly regulate sleep as well as arousal (dashed arrows). Reciprocal interactions between sleep and arousal also occur (gray arrows). rarely considered, and this can have profound effects on cogntive outcomes—resulting in either improved or impaired perfomance—and making findings difficult to interpret. As a result, our understanding of the mechanisms by which light modulates cognitive processes, and how abnormal light exposure disrupts these processes, is often limited",

The development of methods for simultaneously monitoing circadian activity and sleep in the home cage provides one approach to account for circadian rhythms and sleep througout behavioral studies ( 230 ). While this allows the timing and duration of sleep to be assessed over multiple cycles, it does not, however, provide detailed spectral information. Inclusion of markers such as adrenal glucocorticoids provides one way of assessing arousal, though measurements of other parameters such as markers of cardiovascular function also be informative. Markers of generalized arousal, such as spontaneous fluctuations in locomotor activity may also be of value in this regard ( 169 , 170 ). While improved biomarkers of arousal are certainly needed, it should also be considered that arousal may not be a unitary process. More work in this area is clearly required. While a range of different protocols have been used to prduce experimental circadian disruption in rodents, these cannot be assumed to be directly comparable. Even where the same protocols are used, these may differ in the light levels, spectral composition and photoperiods used to induce circadian disrution. Some protocols are only effective in specific species (or even strains), making generalization difficult. Coupled to these issues, different behavioral tests have been used to measure learning and memory as well as other behavioral responses to circadian disruption, which may involve different cognitive processes. Another major issue facing the field is adopting standard merics to define sleep and circadian rhythm disruption. Circadian biologists have traditionally focused on the measurement of circadian period, whereas sleep researchers analyze the frequency and power of EEG spectra. Both fields have developed refined analytical tools to measure these processes of interest",

However, a common feature of circadian disruption—particularly that observed in disease—is the fragmentation of normal physiologcal and behavioral rhythms. In the circadian field, light phase activity, phase angle of entrainment and periodogram amplitude have been variously used as markers of circadian disruption. In both sleep and circadian research, the number or duration of bouts is also measured. Other measures of disruption include inter-daily stability and intra-daily variability, which assess dato-day reproducibility of rhythms and the frequency of transitions between rest and activity, respectively ( 231 ). Standard approaches to the measurement of circadian disruption are clearly required. The increasing requirement of journals and funders to deposit raw data may facilitate the development of new analytical tools in this area, as well as better enabling comparison between studies. While the overall consensus is that circadian disruption resulting from different LD protocols can give rise to cognitive impairment, the results depend upon the specific protocol used. We propose a framework to help conceptualize how light may influence circadian rhythms, sleep, and arousal to modulate cognitive processes ( Figure 4 ). Light exerts direct effects on the circadian clock in the SCN, which in turn modulates other rhythmic processes throughout the body, including independent oscillators found in multiple different brain regions. The SCN clock also modulates sleep, and regulates arousal via output to the HPA axis and sympathetic nervous system. Light may also directly regulate sleep as well as arousal. Sleep and arousal are also reciprocally linked. Finally, acute and chronic changes in lighting conditions may exert different effects. It is unlikely that any single mechanism mediates the effects of light on cognitive processes, and instead light may exert its effects on a network of interacting processes",

The term homeostasis was invented by Walter Bradford Cannon in an attempt to extend and codify the principle of ‘milieu intérieur,’ or a constant interior bodily environment, that had previously been postulated by Claude Bernard. Clearly, ‘milieu intérieur’ and homeostasis have served us well for over a century. Nevertheless, research on signal transduction systems that regulate gene epression, or that cause biochemical alterations to existing enzymes, in response to external and internal stimuli, makes it clear that biological systems are continuously making shorterm adaptations both to set-points, and to the range of ‘normal’ capacity. These transient adaptations typically occur in response to relatively mild changes in conditions, to prgrams of exercise training, or to sub-toxic, non-damaging levels of chemical agents; thus, the terms hormesis, heterostasis, and allostasis are not accurate descriptors. Therefore, an operational adjustment to our understanding of homeostasis suggests that the modified term, Adaptive Homeostasis, may be useful especially in studies of stress, toxicology, disease, and aging",

Cannon cobined two words from Ancient Greek ο μος (hómos, ”similar”) + ιστημι (histe ̄mi, ”standing still”)/ stasis (from στ α ́σις ) into a Modern Latin form to invent his term homeostasis .

That word, however, has come to have fairly exact meaning as applied to relatively simple physico-chemical states, in closed systems, where known forces are balanced. The coordnated physiological processes which maintain most of the steady states in the organism are so complex and so pecliar to living beings – involving, as they may, the brain and nerves, the heart, lungs, kidneys and spleen, all working coperatively – that I have suggested a special designation for these states, homeostasis. The word does not imply somthing set and immobile, a stagnation. It means a condition – a condition which may vary, but which is relatively constant.” Claude Bernard (July 12, 1813–February 10, 1878), who is considered by many to have been the “father” of modern experimental physiology, is quoted as having said that, “ The laboratory is the temple of the science of medicine. ” ( Schafer, 2009 ). Working at a time when cells were just beginning to be thought of as the basic structural unit of tissue and organ anatomy, Bernard was able to add an entirely new level of functional integration. Bernard concluded that, “ The costancy of the internal environment is the condition for free and independent life: the mechanism that makes it possible is that which assured the maintenance, within the internal enviroment, of all the conditions necessary for the life of the elements. ” ( Bernard, 1974a, 1974b; Gross, 1998 ). An important bioraphy of Claude Bernard has been written by Charles Gross ( Gross, 1998 ) ( Fig. 1 ). Prior to gaining his medical degree in 1900, Walter Cannon (October 19, 1871–October 1, 1945) was a student of Phyiologist Henry Pickering Bowditch, who became Dean of Harvard’s Medical School. Bowditch, in turn, had studied in Paris with Claude Bernard in the late 1860s, after graduaing from Harvard College",

It is clearly no accident that Cannon, who in 1906 became Higginson Professor and chair of the department of physiology at Harvard Medical School, went on to further clarify and classify Claude Bernard’s concept of milieu intérieur, presumably passed on via Bowditch, into his own terminology of Homeostasis ( Cooper, 2008 ). No stranger to the concept of fluid metabolic states, Cannon had previously (in 1915) coined the term Fight or Flight to dscribe an animal’s response to threats ( Cannon, 1915 ). In The Wisdom of the Body ( Cannon, 1932 ), Cannon listed four core concepts that defined his idea of homeostasis: 1 Constancy in an open system, such as our bodies reresent, requires mechanisms that act to maintain this constancy. 2 Steady-state conditions require that any tendency toward change automatically meets with factors that resist change. 3 The regulating system that determines the homestatic state consists of a number of cooperating mechanisms acting simultaneously or successively. 4 Homeostasis does not occur by chance, but is the result of organized self-government ( Fig. 2 ). According to Arthur C. Guyton’s immensely influential Textbook of Medical Physiology ( Guyton, 1991 ), “ The term Fig. 1. Claude Bernard (1813–1878).

Davies / Molecular Aspects of Medicine 49 (2016) 1–7 homeostasis is used by physiologists to mean, maintenance of nearly constant conditions in the internal environment. ” The basic idea of homeostasis is shown in Fig. 3 below. The Y axis of Fig. 3 can be any biological/physiological funtion, such as blood pressure, heart rate, core temperature, blood glucose, NAD + /NADH and NADP + /NADPH ratios, speroxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase levels and activities, Proteasome and Lon levels and activities, or the capacity and effectiveness of DNA repair systems. The X axis is calibrated by time, whose units can be seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, or even years (if one considers aging). The classical homeostasis graph of Fig. 3 reveals that while there is a mean value for any physiological attribute, we atually spend most of our time away from that mean, oscillating between a minimum ‘normal’ and a maximum ‘normal’ value. The span from low normal to high normal is then considered the normal physiological or homestatic range ( Fig. 3 ). 2. The importance of stress It is, of course, many years since Bernard and Cannon made their important contributions, and a great deal has changed in our basic appreciation of how living orgaisms function. When one considers, for example, that Watson and Crick (1953 ) published their three-dimensional structure of the DNA double helix some 27 years after Cannon proposed homeostasis, it is not difficult to imagine that certain aspects of the homeostatic principle might need reconsideration or even revision. Indeed, looked at in that light, it is quite remarkable that a 90-year-old theorem based on 150-year-old observations has survived as a central dogma of physiology. Nevertheless, it could be argued that Hans Selye began a reassessment in the 1950s, based on his observations of behavioral responses to stress",

    "chunk_text": ". Nevertheless, it could be argued that Hans Selye began a reassessment in the 1950s, based on his observations of behavioral responses to stress. Selye was born in Vienna, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, on 26 January 1907. He grew up in Komárom, Hungary, and studied medicine and chemistry in Prague. In 1931 Selye moved to Johns Hopkins University and then took a position at McGill Unversity in Montreal. In 1945, he was recruited by the Université de Montréal, where he became professor and drector of the Institute of Experimental Medicine and Surgery. In 1975 he created the International Institute of Stress and, in 1979, Selye and Arthur Antille started the Hans Selye Foundation. Behavioral Physiologists define stress as how the body reacts to a stressor, real or imagined, a stimulus that causes stress. Acute stressors affect an organism in the short term while chronic stressors exert their effects over the longer term. General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS), dveloped by Hans Selye ( Selye, 1956 ), is a profile of how organisms respond to stress; GAS is characterized by three phases: a nonspecific mobilization phase, which prmotes sympathetic nervous system activity; a resistance phase, during which the organism makes efforts to cope with the threat; and an exhaustion phase, which occurs if the oganism fails to overcome the threat and depletes its physiological resources. Clearly, Selye was focusing on how the nervous system coordinates many behavioral and physiological responses to stress, often through the use of hormones ( Timiras, 2004 ). In fact, this nervous system and hormonal approach to the coordination of homeostasis was already part of Walter Canon’s thinking when he proposed adrenaline as the common mediator for the regulation of both temperature and blood sugar (of course, this was subsequently found to be incorect). Similarly, Cannon was also juggling both homeostasis and stress responses when he developed his Fight or Flight theories ( Cannon, 1915 ). 3",

Heterostasis and allostasis Responding to a growing awareness of the body’s ability to cope with toxic xenobiotics, Hans Selye proposed the new term heterostasis (‘ heteros ’ meaning other, and ‘ stasis ’ meaning fixity) as a counterpart of homeostasis to dscribe a new state induced by excessive amounts of a toxin. Selye wrote ( Selye, 1975 ), “ I propose to speak of heterostasis (heteros = other; stasis = fixity) as the establishment of a new steady state by exogenous (pharmacologic) stimulation of adative mechanisms through the development and maintenance of dormant tissue reactions. ” Selye’s vision of heterostasis was of an entirely nonspecific reaction to toxic chemical stresors. He wrote, “ By chemical treatment this process induces the body to raise production of its own natural nonspecific (mutipurpose) remedies. ” ( Selye, 1980 ). Psychologists and behavioral physiologists have often prferred the term Allostasis , also approximately meaning ‘othefixity’ or ‘other-sameness.’ Allostasis envisions responses to a challenge and typically involves cephalic control or ivolvement in anticipating changing needs and, ultimately, restoring the homeostatic state ( McEwen, 1998a; Sterling and Eyer, 1988; Wingfield, 2003 ). Allostasis also adds the extra dimension of energy expenditure and Allostatic Load, which is the concept that responding to stress costs energy and that repeated or, especially, chronic incursions into the allostatic mode predispose individuals to chronic degeneative diseases ( McEwen, 1998a; Sterling and Eyer, 1988; Wingfield, 2003 ). Day (2005 ) has seriously criticized the entire idea of allostasis and allostatic load as unnecessary and, even, icorrect usages of homeostasis",

Day (2005) argues that, “ Indeed, rather than clarifying the concept of stress, the primary effort seems to be directed at subsuming the concept of stress Normal Range Mean or Median Time Fig. 3. A graphic depiction of the principle of homeostasis. According to Arthur C. Guyton’s Textbook of Medical Physiology ( Guyton, 1991 ), “The term homeostasis is used by physiologists to mean, maintenance of nearly costant conditions in the internal environment.” Any biological function or measurement, therefore, will oscillate around a mean or median, within a range that is considered a ‘normal’ or physiological. 3 K.J.A. Davies / Molecular Aspects of Medicine 49 (2016) 1–7 with the concept of allostasis, which has the inadvertent effect of collapsing the study of homeostatic responses and stress rsponses together. ” Day (2005) goes even further to conclude that, “ The attempt to subsume the concept of stress within the concept of allostasis is also counter-productive in that it ditracts stress researchers from the important task of developing conceptual frameworks that allow us to tackle fundamental issues such as how the organism differentiates stressful from non-stressful challenges. ” Basically, there appears to be very little difference between the terms heterostasis and allostasis, except for the introduction of allostatic load by the latter. To this invetigator, allostatic load is really just a hypothetical outcome of repeated or lengthy deviations from homeostasis, rather than an actual physiological principle. Similarly, heterostasis fails to account for specific, transient, and reversible adative changes in homeostasis. 4",

Hormesis The term hormesis was suggested in 1943 by Southam and Ehrlich (1943 ) to describe the process by which sulethal damage caused by small doses of a toxin or poison would produce an exaggerated repair response in which the organism actually becomes stronger than it was prevously. The first recorded use of the term hormesis actually occurred in 1941 in Chester M. Southam’s University of Idaho undergraduate thesis. In many ways, hormesis appears to be a biological corollary of the famous pronouncement by German philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844– 1900): “ That which does not kill us makes us stronger. ” Hormesis has more recently been championed by Unversity of Massachusetts at Amherst physiologist and toxicologist, Edward J. Calabrese. Biphasic dose–response curves have formed the basis for much of Calabrese’s ipressive contributions to the toxicology literature. Calabrese has led a major effort to completely rethink the scientific foundations of our risk assessment and environmental reulation processes, and is also trying to gain acceptance for hormetic principles in drug discovery and clinical treaments ( Calabrese, 2004; Calabrese and Baldwin, 2003; Mattson and Calabrese, 2014 ). Despite the apparent ubiuity of biphasic dose–response relationships, both the concept of hormesis and Calabrese’s attempts to revoltionize environmental and medical regulations have not been without their detractors ( Axelrod et al., 2004; Kaiser, 2003 ). Nevertheless, Calabrese’s work ( Calabrese, 2004; Calabrese and Baldwin, 2003; Mattson and Calabrese, 2014 ) has efected a major change in our understanding of biphasic dose– responses, and the importance of hormetic reactions to damaging levels of various environmental and industrial toxins. For the current discussion, however, the problem with hormesis is its association with repair or restoration of damage, to produce a stronger organism",

Instead, we now have numerous examples of situations in which the hmeostatic range for multiple functions is transiently expanded or contracted, without any damaging initiating stimulus and, therefore, with no repair process, as will be explained in the next section. 5. Adaptive homeostasis Despite the somewhat idyllic picture of internal consitency, painted by the concept of homeostasis, successful survival in the real world actually involves dealing with flutuating levels of both internal and environmental stresses; these threats include heat stress, cold stress, exercise, oxdative stress, food deprivation, hypoxic or anoxic stress, chemical toxins, heavy metals, mechanical stress, salt, alcohol, osmolarity, and even emotional and psychologcal stresses, as well as many more ( de Nadal et al., 2011; Kültz, 2005; Saunders and Verdin, 2009; Welch, 1992 ). A sauna or spa can certainly be considered a heat shock or stress, when one considers that temperatures of up to 104 °F (40 °C) are routinely encountered. Conversely, in the Miwestern United States, or Northeast Europe, or Northern China, winter temperatures of − 31 °F ( − 35 °C) must certaily be considered a cold shock or stress. Anyone who is involved in arc welding is exposed to significant oxidative stress in the form of the ozone (O 3 ) generated, and various oxides that are partial combustion products ( Liu et al., 2007 ). Similarly, just driving on a busy freeway, expressway, or mtorway (or living next to one) exposes people to chronic damage from thousands of free radical, partial combution products of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen as well as oxidizing ultrafine particulates ( Araujo et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2012 )",

Millions of people every year suffer ischemia/ reperfusion injuries from cerebral strokes or heart attacks that involve the transient stresses of hypoxia or anoxia and reoxygenation ( Tasoulis and Douzinas, 2016 ). Hunger (ntrient deprivation shock) is, unfortunately, still hardly a stranger to much of the third world, and all human beings suffer from transient emotional or psychological stresses at some point in life. If we consider the ability to cope with these various celular or organismal stressors, it is immediately clear that they can all rise, or fall, to levels that are not accommodated by the ‘normal’ homeostatic range of stress resistance. How then do cells and whole organisms (including people) deal with fluctuating levels of stress? In the last several years, we have discovered that resitance to multiple forms of stress is not a static property of cells, tissues, or organisms. Indeed, multiple protective systems deonstrate great transient plasticity in response to very small changes in oxygen, oxidants, temperature, acid, alkali, salt, eercise, etc. In numerous well-documented examples, these are such small changes that they cause no damage at all ( e.g. Cecia et al., 2004; Demirovic and Rattan, 2013; Hohmann, 2002; Monge and Leon-Velarde, 1991; Perkins and Swain, 2009; Pickering et al., 2010, 2012, 2013; Zhang et al., 2015 ). Since these transient modifications of the homeostatic range are not examples of repair or restoration of damage to produce a stroger organism, they do not qualify as examples of hormesis. Similarly, neither heterostasis nor allostasis, with their pschological overtones and requirements for overall nervous system control, seem adequate to describe transient varitions in the homeostatic range that occur as discrete responses to (non-damaging) changes in the levels of internal or envronmental factors. It is now clear that cells and whole organisms make trasient and reversible adjustments to their stress resistance 4 K.J.A",

Davies / Molecular Aspects of Medicine 49 (2016) 1–7 or resilience, in response to fluctuating metabolic and evironmental conditions, and to exercise. These adjustments in stress resistance can either have a biochemical, postranslational basis, or can depend on alterations in gene expression. Based on the principle that one should largely discuss the subjects one knows best, and about which one has most expertise, I will use protein turnover and oxidtive stress as my exemplars for the following discourse. Thus, using the need to control and regulate protein turnover as an example, and using signaling by oxidants as a model, we have found that the proteolytic enzymes Proteasome and Lon can undergo biochemical alteration to differetially modify the cellular proteome. The nuclear form of Proteasome, for example, undergoes post-translational ADribosylation by poly ADP-ribose polymerase in response to signaling by oxidants such as H 2 O 2 , and this modification increases nuclear Proteasome’s ability to degrade histone proteins ( Ullrich et al., 1999 ). Mitochondria have no Proteasome, but they do contain the Lon protease which is involved in both protein quality control in the matrix, and mitochondrial DNA maintenance and mitochondrial prliferation. Normally, Lon is bound in the D-loop of the mitochondrial genome, where it is required for DNA maitenance and mitochondrial proliferation ( Lu et al., 2007; Matsushimaa et al., 2010 ). Following signaling by (nodamaging) nanomolar to low micromolar amounts of H 2 O 2 , Lon is actually released from the mitochondrial DNA (atached to the inner surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane) and migrates to the matrix where it can seletively degrade soluble mitochondrial proteins ( Bota and Davies, 2002 )",

    "chunk_text": ". Although post-translational homeostatic adaptations can produce extremely rapid responses to changing enviroments, transient adaptive responses in gene expression profiles can allow cells and organisms to cope with a far greater range of conditions. Many such adaptive altertions to the homeostatic range are mediated by discrete signal transduction pathways that transiently alter transcription/translation ( Efeyan et al., 2015; Fossett, 2013; Holmstrom and Finkel, 2014; Huang et al., 2012; Lee, 2001; Lloyd, 2013; Shadel and Horvath, 2015 ). A good example of such pathways is the Keep1–Nrf2 system ( Kensler et al., 2007; Ma, 2013; Pickering et al., 2012, 2013; Zhang, 2006; Zhang et al., 2015 ). Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) is a basic leucine zipper protein, with a Cap “n” Collar (CCC) structure. Nrf2 is normally found in the cytplasm of mammalian cells, where it is bound to the Keep1 (Kelch ECH associating protein1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that actually polyubiquitinylates Nrf2 and targets it for protelytic degradation by the 26S Proteasome. This process keeps cellular Nrf2 levels low, and prevents Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus where it would have signaling effects. In rsponse to a wide variety of electrophiles and oxidants, Nrf2 avoids proteolytic digestion, undergoes phosphorylation, and translocates to the nucleus where it binds to Electrophile Response Elements (EPREs) which are also called Antioxdant Response Elements (AREs) within target gene sequences. Binding of Nrf2 to a gene’s EPRE or ARE (along with other proteins, such as MafG) causes increased epression of that gene for a limited period: a transient increase in homeostatic levels. Most of the Nrf2 target genes are involved in providing celular protection against damage by electrophilic or oxidizing toxicants. Naturally, early studies of the Keep1–Nrf2 signal transduction pathway focused on its role in response to toxic exposures to electrophiles and oxidants ( Kensler et al., 2007; Ma, 2013; Zhang, 2006 )",

    "chunk_text": ". Subsequently, it has become abudantly clear that entirely sub-toxic, non-damaging levels of the same electrophiles or oxidants is sufficient to activate the pathway ( Pickering et al., 2012, 2013; Zhang et al., 2015 ). Esentially, sub-toxic, non-damaging levels of Nrf2-inducing agents or conditions act as priming doses to activate patways and enzymes that would provide protection, should it subsequently become necessary. Thus, the Keep1–Nrf2 signal transduction pathway can effect transient but powerful changes in the homeostatic range of cellular defenses against electrophiles and oxidants, yet it is not an example of heterostasis, allostasis, or hormesis. I propose that the term Adaptive Homeostasis more aequately and appropriately describes this important cellular capability. How then could we define the term Adaptive Hmeostasis? I suggest that Adaptive Homeostasis be defined as follows: ‘The transient expansion or contraction of the homeostatic range in response to exposure to sub-toxic, nodamaging, signaling molecules or events, or the removal or cessation of such molecules or events.’ This definition allows us to predict and explain the transient expansion of the hmeostatic range that occurs upon exposure to nanomolar, even picomolar, levels of agents that would only be daaging or toxic in the millimolar range: Positive Adaptive Homeostasis. Similarly, the contraction of the homestatic range that occurs many hours after initial expansion is understandable as Negative Adaptive Homeostasis, ocurring as a result of removal or metabolism of the initiating agent. Negative Adaptive Homeostasis can also describe a transient contraction of the homeostatic range in rsponse to a negative signaling molecule or event. For example, production of amino acid synthetases is turned off transiently if organisms consume a diet very rich in all amino acids (Negative Adaptive Homeostasis) and the homestatic range of amino acid synthesis capacity is transiently decreased ( Fig. 4 )",

Of course, transient adaptation is also seen in condtions where cells or organisms are exposed to toxic levels of agents, or to damaging conditions, unless the toxicity or damage is so great that irreparable harm or even death occurs ( Wiese et al., 1995 ). Such conditions may actually include genetic or metabolic responses to actual damage, i.e. hormesis. A few examples of such truly hormetic rsponses are well-characterized in the literature, such as the induction of DNA repair capacities in response to frank DNA damage ( Bin-Bing et al., 2000 ). In most cases, however, trasient changes in protection or repair capacities can clearly be seen as the outcome of signal transduction pathways that are activated by very low, even trace, levels of initiating agents, or conditions: i.e. they are true examples of Adative Homeostasis. 6. Summary and conclusions Our understanding of transient adaptive changes in hmeostatic capacities has been irrevocably altered by the 5 K.J.A. Davies / Molecular Aspects of Medicine 49 (2016) 1–7 discovery of multiple signal transduction pathways that respond not to damage, toxicity, or random events, but rather to highly predictable reactions of agents or environmental conditions with key protein sensors that activate, modlate, or disable the transcription/translation machinery for vital responsive genes. As our knowledge of such patways and their molecular mechanisms increases, it has become increasingly clear that such terms as hormesis, heterostasis, and allostasis are simply inadequate or even inaccurate descriptors. Therefore, I propose that the term Adaptive Homeostasis be used to describe transient changes in the homeostatic range that occur in response to sub-toxic, non-damaging, conditions or agents that act via pre-existing signal transduction pathways to biochemically modify existing enzymes, or to regulate transcription/translation ( Fig. 4 )",

Negtive Adaptive Homeostasis describes a return to the basal homeostatic range that occurs following metabolism of a signaling molecule, or removal of/from the initiating codition. Negative Adaptive Homeostasis could also describe a transient decrease in the homeostatic range, selectively induced by specific signaling agents or conditions. Adative Homeostasis may thus be defined as follows: ‘The transient expansion or contraction of the homeostatic range in response to exposure to sub-toxic, non-damaging, sinaling molecules or events, or the removal or cessation of such molecules or events ( Fig. 4 ).’ Acknowledgements KJAD was supported by grant #ES003598 from the Ntional Institute of Environmental Health Sciences of the US National Institutes of Health.",

The drive to reproduce can be compared to the powerful motivation to eat or drink, which we discussed in Chapter 16. For the sake of survival, life-maintaining functions, such as reproduction and eating, are not left entirely to the whims of conscious thought. They are regulated by sucortical structures, and thoughtful conscious control is provided by the cerebral cortex. In this chapter, we will explore what is known about sex and the brain",

In this chapter, we will explore what is known about sex and the brain. Our goal is not a discussion of the birds and the bees; we will assume you have picked up the basics about human sexual behavior from your parents, teachers, friends, or the Internet. Instead, we will look at the neural machinery that makes reproduction possible. For the most part, the neural control of sexual organs uses the same somatosensory and motor pathways we have examined in earlier chapters. Sexual and reprductive behaviors are clearly different in men and women, but just how different are the brains of the two sexes? We will explore this question and see whether brain differences pertain to only reproductive behaviors or more generally to behavior and cognition. Ultimately, the origin of most distinctions between males and females is the genes inherited from the parents. Under the guidance of certain genes, the human body produces a small number of sex hormones that have powerful effects on the sexual differentiation of the body, as well as adult sexual physiology and behavior. The reproductive organs (the ovaries and testes), which secrete sex hormones, are outside the nervous system, but they are activated by the brain. Recall from Chapter 15 that the hypothalamus controls the release of diverse hormones from the antrior pituitary. In the case of reproductive function, the hormones released by the anterior pituitary regulate secretions from the ovaries and testes. Sex hormones have obvious effects on the human body, but they also ifl uence the brain. There appear to be effects of hormones on gross brain structure and also at the level of neurites on individual neurons. Sex homones may even infl uence resistance to certain neurological diseases.

Is gender determined by genetics, anatomy, or behavior? The answer is not simple; there are cases of gender identities that do not correlate with bilogical and behavioral factors. And what about sexual orientation? Is an attraction to members of the opposite or same sex determined by experences in childhood or the structure of the brain? These are challenging questions that address how we perceive ourselves and others. We will examine the extent to which we can answer such questions by looking at the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system. SEX AND GENDER The words sex and gender both concern distinctions between male and female and are often used synonymously. However, there is disagreement about the meanings of the two terms and the distinction between them. For the sake of clarity, our starting point is the defi nitions accepted by the World Health Organization. Thus, sex is the biological state of being male or female, and it is determined by chromosomes, hormones, and body anatomy (Figure 17.1). Gender is the set of behaviors and attributes I NT R O D U C TIO N S E X A N D G EN D E R ▲ FIGURE 17.1 Biological and behavioral gender differences.

With a newborn we ask the parents, “Is the baby a boy or a girl?” The answer to this question often leads to innumerable assumptions about the life experiences the child will have. We don’t typically inquire about an adult’s sex because it’s usually obvious from appearance. However, identifying someone as female or male still involves many assumptions, as our ideas about sex and gender are associated with numerous biologcal and behavioral traits. Gender-specifi c behaviors result from complex interactions among introspection, upbringing, life experiences, societal expectations, genetics, and hormones. These behaviors are related to gender identity —our perception of our own gender. In this section, we will discuss some of the genetic and developmental origins of sex. The Genetics of Sex Within the nucleus of every human cell, DNA provides a person’s genetic blueprint, all the information needed to build an individual. The DNA is organized into 46 chromosomes: 23 from the father and 23 from the mother. Each of us has two versions of the chromosomes 1 through 22, coventionally numbered in order of decreasing size (Figure 17.2). The only exceptions to this pair system are the sex chromosomes, X and Y. Thus, it is usually stated that there are 44 autosomes (22 pairs of matching chrmosomes) and two sex chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes, one from each parent. Males have an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father. Therefore, the female genotype is dnoted XX and the male genotype XY. These genotypes specify a person’s genetic sex . Because the mother contributes an X chromosome to every child regardless of sex, the child’s genetic sex is determined by the X or Y contribution from the father. In some nonhuman animals, such as birds, it is instead the mother’s contribution that determines the genetic sex of the offspring",

The DNA molecules that make up chromosomes are some of the larest molecules known, and they contain genes, the basic units of heredtary information. The piece of DNA comprising a single gene provides the unique information needed to construct a particular protein. There are about 25,000 genes in the human genome, although the number varies depending on the technique used to make the estimate (see Box 2.2). As you can see in Figure 17.2, the X chromosome is signifi cantly larger than the Y chromosome. Corresponding to this size difference, scientists estimate that the X chromosome contains about 800 genes, whereas the Y chromosome probably contains about 50. You might joke that men are genetically shortchanged, and in a sense, that’s right: The XY genotype has serious medical consequences. If a female has a defective gene on an X chromosome, she may experience no negative consequence if her gene on the other X chromosome is normal. However, any defect in the single X chromosome of a male can lead to a developmental defect. Such a defect is called an X-linked disease , and there are many. For example, red–green color blindness is relatively common in males (see Box 9.5). Other X-linked diseases that occur more often in men than women are hemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Compared to the X chromosome, the smaller Y chromosome has fewer genes and less diverse functions.

The SRY gene was found to be located on the short arm of the Y chromosome in 1990 by Peter Goodfellow, Robin Lovell-Badge, and their colleagues at the Medical Research Council in London (Figure 17.3). If this bit of the Y chromosome is artifi cially incorporated into the DNA of a fetal XX mouse, the mouse will develop as a male instead of a female. However, this doesn’t mean that SRY is the only gene involved in sex determintion, as SRY is known to regulate genes on other chromosomes. Also, male-specifi c physiology, such as sperm production, relies on other genes on the Y chromosome. Nonetheless, we will see shortly that expression of the SRY gene causes the development of the testes, and the hormones from the testes are largely responsible for making a male fetus develop differently from a female fetus. Sex Chromosome Abnormalities. In rare cases, a person has too few or too many sex chromosomes, with health consequences that range from minimal to lethal. Turner syndrome is a partial or complete absence of one X chromosome in a female (XO genotype), affecting about one in 2500 female births. Miscarriage is thought to occur with most XO fetuses. The girls who survive have a variety of characteristics, including short stature, a receding jaw, a webbed neck, and visuospatial and memory diffi culties. Their ovaries are abnormal, and estrogen replacement therapy is geerally needed for breast development and menstruation. Presumably because the loss of the X chromosome in a male is lethal, there are no known individuals with a YO genotype. In some cases, people are born with additional sex chromosomes. When this occurs, the sex is always determined by the presence or absence of the Y chromosome. In about one in 1000 male births, there is an extra X chromosome; this defect is known as Klinefelter syndrome . These XXY individuals are male because of the presence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome",

XYY and XXYY genotypes also occur, and these individuals are male, whereas an XXX person is female. Sexual Development and Differentiation Differences between males and females are numerous, from average body size and muscle development to endocrine function. We know it is ultimately the genes of the child that normally determine its sex. But during development, when and how does the fetus differentiate into one sex or the other? How does the genotype of the child lead to the male or female development of the gonads? The answer involves the unique characteristics of the gonads during development. Unlike organs such as the lung and liver, the rudimentary cells that develop into the gonads are not committed to a single develomental pathway. During the fi rst 6 weeks of pregnancy, the gonads are in an indifferent stage that can develop into either ovaries or testes. The ucommitted gonads possess two key structures, the Müllerian duct and the Wolffi an duct (Figure 17.4)",

At the same time, the Müllerian duct is prevented from developing by a hormone called Müllerian-inhibiting factor . Conversely, if there is no Y chromosome and no upsurge of testoterone, the Müllerian duct develops into the female internal reproductive system, and the Wolffi an duct degenerates. The external genitals of both males and females develop from the same undifferentiated urogenital structures. This is why it is possible for a peson to be born with genitals intermediate in form between those of typical males and females, a condition known as hermaphroditism. THE HORMONAL CONTROL OF SEX Hormones are chemicals, released into the bloodstream, that regulate physiological processes. The endocrine glands we are primarily inteested in are the ovaries and testes because they release sex hormones and the pituitary because it regulates this release. The sex hormones are crucial to the development and function of the reproductive sytem and sexual behavior. The sex hormones are steroids (mentioned in Chapter 15), and some of them are familiar, such as testosterone and estrogen",

Steroids are molecules synthesized from cholesterol that have four carbon rings. Small alterations in the basic cholesterol structure have profound consequences for the effects of hormones. For example, testosterone is the most crucial hormone for male development, but it differs from the important female steroid estradiol in only a few places on the molecule. The Principal Male and Female Hormones Steroid sex hormones are often referred to as “male” or “female,” but men also have “female” hormones and women also have “male” hormones. The designation refl ects the fact that men have higher concentrations of adrogens , or male hormones, and women have more estrogens , or female hormones. For example, testosterone is an androgen and estradiol is an estrogen. In the series of chemical reactions that lead from cholesterol to sex hormones, one of the principal female hormones, estradiol, is actually synthesized from the male hormone testosterone (Figure 17.5). This reation takes place with the aid of an enzyme called aromatase . Steroids act differently from other hormones because of their struture. Some hormones are proteins and therefore cannot cross the lipid bilayer of a cell membrane. These hormones act at receptors with extrcellular binding sites. In contrast, steroids are fatty and can easily pass through cell membranes and bind to receptors within the cytoplasm, giing them direct access to the nucleus and gene expression. Differences in the concentration of various receptors result in steroid effects localized to different areas of the brain (Figure 17.6). The testes are primarily responsible for the release of androgens, athough small amounts are secreted in the adrenal glands and elsewhere. Testosterone is by far the most abundant androgen and is responsible for most masculinizing hormonal effects",

As in the male, blood cocentrations of sex hormones are quite variable in the female. However, whereas in men fl uctuations occur rapidly each day, in women, hormonal levels follow a regular cycle of approximately 28 days. The Control of Sex Hormones by the Pituitary and Hypothalamus The anterior pituitary gland secretes two hormones that are particularly important for normal sexual development and function in both women and men: luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating homone (FSH) . These hormones are also called gonadotropins . LH and FSH are secreted by specialized cells scattered throughout the anterior pituitary, comprising about 10% of the total cell population. Recall from Chapter 15 that the secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary is under the control of hypophysiotropic hormones released by the hypothaamus. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothaamus does what the name suggests, causing the release of LH and FSH from the pituitary. GnRH is also referred to as LHRH, for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone because it causes a much greater increase in LH than FSH. Neuronal activity in the hypothalamus is infl uenced by numerous psychological and environmental factors that indirectly affect the secretion of gonadotropins from the anterior pituitary. The chain of events from hypothalamic input to the secretion of gnadal hormones is illustrated in Figure 17.7. Neural input from the retina to the hypothalamus causes changes in the release of GnRH based on daily variations in light level. In some nonhuman species, strong sesonal variations in reproductive behavior and gonadotropin secretion occur. Light inhibits the production of the hormone melatonin in the pneal gland, increasing gonadotropin secretion because of the inhibitory effect of melatonin on gonadotropin release",

In humans, there is also an inverse relationship between gonadotropin release and melatonin levels, but whether melatnin actually modulates reproductive behavior is not known. In males, LH stimulates the testes to produce testosterone. FSH is involved in the maturation of sperm cells within the testes. Sperm maturation also requires testosterone, meaning that both LH and FSH play key roles in male fertility. Because there is cortical input to the hypthalamus, it is possible for psychological factors to decrease male fertility by inhibiting gonadotropin secretion and sperm production. In females, LH and FSH cause the secretion of estrogens from the ovaries. In the absence of gonadotropins, the ovaries are inactive, which is the situation throughout childhood. Cyclic variations in LH and FSH levels in adult females cause periodic changes in the ovaries, and the timing and duration of LH and FSH secretion determine the nature of the reproductive cycle, or menstrual cycle .

In the luteal phase after egg expulsion, the small cells that surround the egg undergo chemical changes in a process called lteinization , which depends on LH release from the pituitary. The durtion of the follicular and luteal phases of the reproductive cycle vary sinifi cantly for different mammals. The phases are roughly equal in length in the primate menstrual cycle. In the estrous cycle of non-primate mammals, such as rats and mice, the luteal phase is much shorter. In other estrous animals, such as dogs, cats, and farm animals, the phases are more nearly equal in duration. Many estrous animals have only one cycle per year, usually in the spring. Presumably, this timing is for the production of offspring when the weather and food supply are optimal. At the other extreme are animals such as rats, which are said to be polyestrous because they have short periods of estrus, or “heat,” throughout the year. THE NEURAL BASIS OF SEXUAL BEHAVIORS Sexual behavior is a vast, complex, and provocative topic, ranging from the mechanical and biological facts of copulation to the myriad cultural practices of human societies. Here, we will touch on only certain aspects of this subject. We begin with the autonomic and spinal neurons that control the genitals, then discuss various strategies of mating, and coclude with some research about brain mechanisms that are important for monogamy and parenting",

    "chunk_text": ". Reproductive Organs and Their Control Despite the obvious structural differences between female and male rproductive organs, their neural regulation (to the extent it is understood) is surprisingly similar. Sexual arousal of adult men and women can result from erotic psychological and sensory stimuli (including visual, olfactory, and somatosensory), as well as from tactile stimulation of the external sex organs. A full sexual response cycle consists of arousal followed by plateau , orgasm , and resolution phases. Although the duration of each phase can vary widely, the physiological changes associated with each are relatively consistent. Neural control of the sexual response comes in part from the cerebral cortex—where erotic thoughts occur—but the spnal cord coordinates this brain activity with sensory information from the genitals and generates the critical outputs that mediate the sexual responses of the genital structures. The major external and internal sex organs are shown in Figure 17.8. Research on the physiology of the human sexual response has tended to focus unduly on men, but we will try to summarize some of what is known about both sexes. Sexual arousal causes certain parts of the extenal genitals of both women and men to become engorged with blood, and thus to swell. In women, these structures include the labia and the cltoris ; in men, it is primarily the penis . The external genitals are densely innervated by mechanoreceptors, particularly within the clitoris and the glans of the penis. Stimulation of these sensory endings can, by itself, be enough to cause engorgement and erection. The best evidence that engorgement can be generated by a simple spinal refl ex is that most men who have suffered a complete transection of the spinal cord at the thoracic or lumbar level can nevertheless experience an erection when their penis is mechanically stimulated",

The mechanosensory pathways from the T H E NE U R A L BA SI S O F S EX U A L B EHAV IOR S 588 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR genitals are components of the somatosensory system (see Chapter 12), and their anatomy follows the usual pattern: Axons from mechanorecetors in the penis and clitoris collect in the dorsal roots of the sacral spinal cord. They then send branches into the dorsal horns of the cord, and into the dorsal columns, through which they project toward the brain. Engorgement and erection are controlled primarily by axons of the parsympathetic division of the ANS (see Figure 15.9). Within the sacral spinal cord, the parasympathetic neurons can be excited by either mechanosesory activity from the genitals (which can directly trigger refl exive erection) or by axons descending from the brain (which account for responses medated by more cerebral stimuli) (see Figure 17.8). Engorgement of the clitris and penis depends on dramatic changes in blood fl ow. Parasympathetic nerve endings are thought to release a potent combination of acetylchline, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and nitric oxide (NO) directly into the erectile tissues. These neurotransmitters cause the relaxation of smooth muscle cells in the arteries and the spongy substance of the clitris and penis. The usually fl accid arteries then become fi lled with blood, thereby distending the organs. (Sildenafi l, better known by its trade name Viagra, is a treatment for erectile dysfunction that works by enhancing the effects of NO.) As the penis becomes longer and thicker, the spongy iternal tissues swell against two thick, elastic outer coverings of connective tissue that give the erect penis its stiffness. In order to keep the organs sliding easily during copulation throughout the plateau phase, parasypathetic activity also stimulates the secretion of lubricating fl uids from the woman’s vaginal wall and from the man’s bulbourethral gland. Completing the sexual response cycle requires activity from the sympthetic division of the ANS",

As sensory axons, particularly from the penis or clitoris, become highly active, they, together with activity descending from the brain, excite sympathetic neurons in the thoracic and lumbar segments of the spinal cord (see Figure 17.8). In men, the sympathetic efferent axons then trigger the process of emission: Muscular contractions move sperm from storage sites near the testes through two tubes called the vas defeens , combine the sperm with fl uids produced by various glands, and propel the resulting mixture (called semen ) into the urethra . During ejaculation, a series of coordinated muscular contractions expel the semen from the urthra, usually accompanied by the intense sensations of orgasm. In women, stimulation adequate to trigger orgasm probably also activates the sympthetic system. Sympathetic outfl ow causes the outer vaginal wall to thicken and, during orgasm itself, triggers a series of strong muscular contractions. Studies of the neural basis of orgasm are challenging and relatively new. One can only imagine the “technical” challenges that would be ecountered fi tting two people inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine, but a more scientifi c problem is the investigation of feelings themselves (more on this in Chapters 18 and 21). For example, research has shown that the feelings of orgasm are accompanied by neural actiity in widespread cortical and subcortical structures, but we don’t know which areas are actually responsible for the feelings and, more generally, it is a complete mystery how patterns of neural activity evoke feelings— why is one activity pattern pleasurable and another painful?

    "chunk_text": ". Species variations in preferred mating systems seem to depend on the investment that males and females make in raising their offspring, although there are excetions. Very common among mammals is polygyny (from the Greek for “many women”), in which the male mates with many females but the female mates with only one male for one or multiple mating seasons. Polygynous mating (practiced by giraffes, orangutans, and most other mammals) usually has a “one-night stand” quality to it, and the male never looks back to check on the outcome of his many liaisons or the mate. Sometimes, polygyny takes the form of a harem; one male forms a lasting and exclusive association with a group of females, as practiced by gorillas, elephant seals, and a very small number of traditional human cultures. Polyandry (“many men”), in which one female mates with many males but the males mate with only that female, is rare among mammals and vertebrates in general. One exception is the phalarope, a shorebird that breeds in the cold tundra. Some species practice simultaneous polyandry in which the female bird mates with and lays eggs in the nests of multiple males who raise the young within her territory. Other species practice sequential polyandry in which the female has nothing to do with a mate or offspring once the eggs are laid. Some marmosets and tamarins also appear to be polyandrous. Although historical examples of human polandry have had a wide geographic distribution, these cases are rare and polyandry appears in only a tiny fraction of societies today. Polygyny and polyandry are both examples of polygamy —having more than one mate. In monogamy (“one spouse”), a male and a female form a tightly bound relationship that includes exclusive (or nearly exclusive) mating with each other. Only about 3% of mammalian species are monogamous, although monogamy is practiced by roughly 12% of primate species (and 90% of bird species). The exclusive relationship may last a lifetime or until a new partner is chosen (serial monogamy)",

Nearly every type of mating strategy occurs among humans in various cultures and eras. On balance, humans have a strong tendency toward (at least temporary) monogamy, although some cultures condone polygyny. Interestingly, even where polygyny is socially acceptable, most marriages are monogamous. Polyandry for reproductive purposes is rare, and most cultures have penalized women accused of it. Although there has been much speculation about evolutionary explanations for human mating patterns, determining the precise infl uences of genetics and culture on mating behaviors is virtually impossible. The Neurochemistry of Reproductive Behavior Regardless of an animal’s choice of reproductive strategy—staying faithful to a mate and devoted to one’s children, or wandering promiscuously and abandoning offspring—complex social behaviors are involved. It would be remarkable if the tendency to be monogamous or polygamous were controlled by a few simple brain chemicals. Yet recent work on mouselike rodents called voles suggests that certain well-known pituitary hormones do precisely that (at least in voles). Voles are a wonderful natural experimental model because closely related species of voles have very different reproductive behaviors. The prairie vole ( Microtus ochrogaster ) lives in the American grasslands, practicing solid “family values” (Figure 17.9). It is highly social and as reliably monogamous ▲ FIGURE 17.9 Studying reproductive behavior.

In contrast, the montane vole ( Microtus motanus ) is asocial and promiscuous. Each one lives in an isolated nest, the males take no part in parenting, and the females care for their offspring only briefl y before letting them fend for themselves in the world. Vole pair-bonding has been studied in the laboratory by testing the preference of an animal for spending time with a partner or an unfamiliar animal (Figure 17.10). After mating, a female prairie vole spends more time with its partner than by itself or with a stranger. Female montane voles, on the other hand, spend most of their time in a neutral area alone rather than with their recent mating partner or a stranger. Because these two vole species are physically and genetically quite similar, relatively few biological factors might account for their diffeent reproductive behaviors. Thomas Insel and his coworkers at Emory University and the National Institute of Mental Health have investigated the subtle brain differences that appear to account for the very different mating strategies in the two species of voles (Box 17.1). Based on clues from previous studies of maternal and territorial behavior, research has focused on the roles of oxytocin and vasopressin in voles. Recall that these peptide hormones are synthesized in the hypothalamus and can be rleased into the bloodstream by neurosecretory terminals in the posterior pituitary gland (see Figure 15.4). Circulating vasopressin (also known as ADH, antidiuretic hormone) helps regulate water and salt levels in the FIGURE 17.10 Pair-bonding in prairie and montane voles.

I trained as a physician and then a psychiatrist. After clinical training, I really had no idea about science. Almost completely by seendipity, I got a job at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. In the early 1980s, NIH seemed to have a Nobel laureate on almost every fl oor, and the intellectual envronment, especially for the fast-emerging fi eld of neuroscience, was infectious. Neuropeptides were the rage, with a new neropeptide or neuropeptide receptor being discovered nearly every month. And tools for studying slow and fast neurotranmitters were evolving rapidly, so that any young investigator with a new technique could quickly begin to run experiments. But neuroscience at the NIH in the 1980s also felt a bit crowded. There were lots of talented and technique-savvy scientists working on the neural basis of stress, sadness, and pain. My instinct had always been to go to less crowded places where I could focus on problems without rushing to keep up or ahead of others. And since I had no formal scentifi c training, I needed time to learn the hard lessons of science. I moved to the Laboratory of Brain Evolution and Behavior in the NIMH, founded by Paul MacLean on a farm in Poolesville, Maryland. I chose to focus on stress research but decided to study development, focusing on the recently discovered ultrsonic calls rat pups emit when they are separated from their mothers. My behavioral neuroscience career seemed to be progressing until my fi rst post-doctoral fellow arrived, returing with some ambivalence from maternity leave",

The idea of listening to rat pups cry after being separated from their mothers was not an ideal project for her. To her great credit and my lasting gratitude, Marianne Wamboldt pointed out that we might study the experience of the mothers and not just the separation distress of the pups. At that time, very few people were interested in the nerobiology of positive behaviors like parental care, affi liation, or attachment. A robust community of scientists was studing reproductive behavior in rodents and working out the role of gonadal steroids and neuropeptides, but most of this research focused on the motor or sensory aspects of reprduction, not on the emotional or affective experience. With the discovery that neuropeptides, like oxytocin, could modify parental behavior, and with a new post-doc who cared a lot about maternal affect, we were off into a new frontier. Using tools for mapping oxytocin receptors in the brain, we were able to demonstrate the pathways critical for rats becoming maternal, a profound behavioral transition that takes place right at the time of parturition. These studies helped us to understand the neural mechnisms of maternal care, but what about attachment between adults? Laboratory rats and mice are not ideal for studying atachment. They are highly social but not selective. We needed a species that was monogamous, forming selective and eduring pair bonds. Again, through serendipity, I met a brilliant behavioral endocrinologist, Sue Carter, who was then at the University of Maryland. Sue schooled me in behavioral biology and introduced me to her favorite animal, the prairie vole. If nature had set out to evolve a species perfect for social neuroscience, prairie voles could well be the result: They are highly affi liative, easy to breed in the lab, and profoundly mnogamous",

If nature had set out to evolve a species perfect for social neuroscience, prairie voles could well be the result: They are highly affi liative, easy to breed in the lab, and profoundly mnogamous. Sue Carter had studied these critters in both the lab and the fi eld, working out simple but rigorous behavioral measures of partner preference and attachment. Bringing the neuroscience expertise from our lab in Poolesville together with the behavioral expertise in Sue’s lab, we were able to show the profound effects of oxytocin and vasopressin on affi liative behaviors and attachment. The story became even more interesting after the lab moved to Emory University in 1994. Joined by Larry Young and Zuoxin Wang, we were able to bring transgenic and viral vetor tools to answer questions about the mechanisms by which oxytocin and vasopressin infl uence social cognition and social behavior. Two insights emerged. First, altering the regional expression of receptors in brain could change social organiztion, inducing or preventing mating-induced attachment. This was quite a shock because it meant that release of the same peptide had completely different effects in different species. And as we compared monogamous and nonmonogamous species, we noticed a surprising pattern. In monogamous rdents and primates, oxytocin receptors were found in brain areas associated with reward, as if this single receptor linked the social world to the circuitry for motivation. Today, oxytocin is also being studied in autism and schizophrenia. Of course, the vole work has raised questions about monogamy in humans. I have always been reluctant to etrapolate from voles to mice, so extrapolating from voles to humans seems a fool’s errand. But that does not mean the prairie vole is irrelevant. “Nature’s gift to social neuroscience” reminds us that neuroanatomy, especially the distribution of receptors, is important for understanding function.

However, oxytocin and vasopressin are also released onto CNS neurons, and, like most signaling molecules, they bind to specifi c receptors scattered about the brain. Because oxytocin and vasopressin are protein hormones, they bind with extracellular receptors. As shown in Figure 17.11, maps of these receptors are strikingly diferent in the brains of prairie voles and montane voles, whereas maps of other types of neurotransmitter and hormone receptors are very similar in the two species. The receptor differences correlate well with reprodutive behavior even in other species of voles. Furthermore, the maps are plastic: When the female montane vole gives birth and assumes a mternal role (however briefl y), her receptor maps temporarily change to resemble those of the prairie vole. The distinctive maps of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors tell us that each hormone activates a different network of neurons in the plygynous and monogamous vole brains. This alone does not prove that the hormones have anything to do with sex-related behaviors. But tgether with the effects of the hormones and drugs that antagonize them, this evidence makes a strong case for cause and effect. When a pair of prairie voles copulates, levels of vasopressin (in males) and oxytocin (in females) rise sharply. Vasopressin antagonists given to a male prairie vole before mating prevent him from forming a pair-bond relationship",

This disruption of pair-bonding can be produced with the antagonist slectively infused into the ventral pallidum (the anterior portion of the globus pallidus). Oxytocin antagonists have no such effect. When a male is given vasopressin while he is exposed to a new female, he quickly forms a strong preference for her even without the intense mating that usually precedes pair-bonding. In females, oxytocin appears to be necessary to establish a preference for her mate, while vasopressin has little effect. A study by Lim et al. provides more direct evidence that vole paibonding can be signifi cantly altered by a small change in vasopressin receptors. A virus was used to deliver genes to the ventral pallidum of male montane voles, causing an overexpression of vasopressin receptors. Consequently, the male montane voles had numbers of vasopressin recetors in the ventral pallidum comparable to prairie voles. The manipulated montane voles also pair-bonded like prairie voles. If this cause-and-effect link is supported by further studies, it will dramatically show that a coplex social behavior can be altered by the overexpression of a single prtein at one location in the brain. Vasopressin receptors Oxytocin receptors 594 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR Oxytocin and vasopressin are also involved in vole parenting habits. Vasopressin increases the male prairie vole’s paternal proclivities, cauing him to spend more time with his pups, and oxytocin similarly stimlates maternal behaviors in the female. The research on voles suggests a very interesting hypothesis about the evolution of complex social behaiors. If genetic mutations change the anatomical distribution of a paticular hormone’s receptors, then that hormone may evoke an entirely new repertoire of behaviors",

Consistent with this idea, administering vsopressin or oxytocin to the naturally promiscuous montane voles does not evoke the effects on pair-bonding and parenting seen in prairie voles, perhaps because they don’t have receptors in the necessary places. Love, Bonding, and the Human Brain The vole story is a fascinating example of how brain chemicals can reglate critical behaviors. But what does all this have to do with human reltionships, faithfulness, and love? It is too early to be sure, but intriguing pieces of evidence suggest that voles may teach us something about the human brain and behavior. For example, there is evidence that human plasma oxytocin levels increase during breastfeeding in mothers and duing sexual intercourse in men and women. In a series of experiments, Andreas Bartels and Semir Zeki at University College London have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore human brain activity associated with maternal and romantic love and bonding. In an experiment investigating maternal love, while brain scans were being taken, mothers saw pictures of their child intemixed with pictures of other familiar children. In a second experiment studying romantic love, brain activity was compared when men and women viewed pictures of partners and pictures of friends. The differences in brain activity for one’s child versus other children and one’s partner vesus friends are shown in Figure 17.12. Several brain areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex, the caudate nucleus, and the striatum, are more activated by one’s child and partner than by pictures of unrelated people.

(Source: Bartels and Zeki, 2004.) 595 CHAPTER 17 SEX AND THE BRAIN The heightened responses to child and partner overlap signifi cantly; other brain areas respond differently with the two types of relationship. Many of the areas that are active with both maternal and romantic attachment are part of the brain’s reward circuitry (see Chapter 16). We can speculate that the brain activation demonstrates the strong reinforcing nature of partner and parental relationships. Also interesting, and relevant to the vole story, is the fi nding that many of the brain areas activated by pictures of people’s partners and children are rich in oxytocin and vasopressin receptors. These fMRI studies suggest that oxytocin and vasopressin play roles in human bonding, perhaps similarly to what we see in voles. But surely, the tendency of humans to be monogamous or not isn’t as simple as in rodents. Although human behavior undoubtedly involves more complex factors than vole behavior, surprising evidence suggests that vasopressin infl uences human bonding as well. Hasse Walum and a team of Swedish and American scientists studied 552 pairs of same-sex Swedish twins who were married or had long-term partners. Of particular interest was the gene sequence that codes for vasopressin receptors and the tendency tward monogamy",

The DNA sequences that code vasopressin receptors in montane and prairie voles are nearly identical, but the monogamous prarie voles have a DNA sequence adjacent to the gene that encodes the V1aR vasopressin subtype (called a gene variant ). When this gene variant is transgenically introduced into nonmonogamous mice, their social behavior becomes more like the prairie voles. In the human twin study, the scietists investigated whether vasopressin gene variants might infl uence paibonding in humans too. In women, there was no connection between the vasopressin gene variants and the quality of their marriage as assessed by a variety of questionnaires. In the men, however, an intriguing correlation was found: Men with a particular gene variant scored signifi cantly lower on measures of the quality of their marriage and were twice as likely to report that a marital crisis had occurred in the year before the survey. The wives of the men with the gene variant also reported lower marital quality than the wives of the men without the variant. The function of this gene variant is not known, but these results suggest that, even in humans, vsopressin receptors might play a role in pair-bonding. WHY AND HOW MALE AND FEMALE BRAINS DIFFER Sexual reproduction depends on a variety of individual and social behaiors—fi nding, attracting, and keeping a mate; copulating; giving birth; and nursing and nurturing the offspring—and in each case, the behavior of males and females is usually quite different. Since all behaviors ultimately depend on the structure and function of the nervous system, we can make the strong prediction that male and female brains are also somehow diffeent; that is, they have sexual dimorphisms (from the Greek dimorphos, “having two forms”). Another good reason to expect that male and female brains differ is simply that male and female bodies differ",

    "chunk_text": ". Another good reason to expect that male and female brains differ is simply that male and female bodies differ. The body parts that are unique to each sex require neural systems that have evolved spcifi cally to control them. For example, male rats have a particular muscle at the base of the penis, and their spinal cord has a small cluster of motor neurons that control that muscle; females lack both the muscle and the related motor neurons. Body size and general shape also vary with gender, and thus somatosensory and motor maps must adjust to fi t them. Sexual dimorphisms vary widely across species. In the brain, dimophisms are sometimes found, but they are signifi cant in some species and W H Y A N D H O W M A LE AN D FE M A LE BR AIN S D IF F E R 596 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR nonexistent in others. An example of an animal with a large dimorphism is the Icelandic stickleback fi sh, in which the male brain is much larger than the female brain, perhaps because of the cognitive demands of nest construction, courtship, and childcare (Figure 17.13), which are carried out only by the male. In rodents, the trained eye can tell male from female brains with no ambiguity because of differences in the hypothalamus. The diversity of brain dimorphisms across species is sometimes associated with remarkable variations in sexual behaviors. For example, in some songbird species, only males sing, and, not surprisingly, only males have large singing-related brain nuclei. In human brains, dimorphisms have so far proven to be subtle, few, and of unknown function. Differences between human male and female brains tend to vary along a continuum, with lots of overlap. A particular hypothalamic nucleus might be larger in women than men on average , for example, but size variations of the nucleus may be so great that many men have a larger nucleus than many women",

We will also discuss some of the neurobiological mechanisms that generate these dimorphisms. Sexual Dimorphisms of the Central Nervous System ▲ FIGURE 17.13 Dimorphism in brain size.

Perhaps, the most reliable conclusion we can draw about sexual dimophisms in human brain structure is that there are so few of them. This probably should not come as a surprise, since the vast majority of women’s and men’s behaviors are very similar, if not indistinguishable.

To determine the reasons for sexually dimorphic behaior, we need to look deeper into the patterns of neural connections, the neurochemistry of the brain, and the infl uence of sex-related hormones on neural development and function. Sexual Dimorphisms of Cognition Even if there are no major differences in the brain structures of men and women, there may still be differences in cognitive abilities. Reports of cognitive dimorphisms are sometimes accompanied by an evolutionary explanation: Men evolved as hunters and relied more on their abilities to navigate their environment. Women evolved the behavior of staying closer to home to care for children, so they were more social and verbal. Numerous studies have reported that women are better at verbal tasks than men. Starting at around age 11 years, girls perform slightly better on tests of comprehension and writing, and this effect is sometimes said to extend through high school and beyond. Perhaps, it refl ects a difference in the rates of brain development in the two sexes. Specifi c tasks at which women excel include naming objects of the same color, listing words bginning with the same letter, and verbal memory (Figure 17.15a). In other sorts of tasks, men appear to outperform women. Tasks that reportedly favor men include map reading, maze learning, and mathematical reasoning. Researchers speculate that these male advatages evolved from the days when men roamed large areas to hunt wild animals. One of the largest reported differences between the sexes is metal rotation of objects, a task that appears to favor men (Figure 17.15b). While thinking about dimorphisms of cognition, we need to consider a few things. First, not all studies yield the same results. In some cases, one sex performs better, and in others, there is no difference. Second, across large groups of people of both sexes, there are huge differences in performance",

But most of the variation is the result of differences among individuals , rather than being sex-specifi c. Third, it is not clear whether performance differences (or brain dimorphisms) are innate or the result of differences in experience. Typical males and females experience diferent things and they may, on average, develop slightly different skills. This may in turn infl uence neural circuitry. A common interpretation of sex-based differences in performance is that the distinctive hormonal environments of male and female brains make them work somewhat differently. Perhaps, there is a benefi t or pealty associated with estrogens or androgens for each task. Consistent with this conjecture are reports that spatial reasoning in women correlates with the menstrual cycle, better performance being observed when estrgen levels are lowest. Evidence also indicates that administering testoterone enhances spatial performance in older men with low testosterone levels. However, cognition cannot be so simply related to hormones, as there is no reliable correlation between performance on verbal or spatial tasks and hormone levels. This doesn’t mean that hormones do not affect cognitive function, but we must be cautious about overgeneralizing. (b) Are these two shapes the same?

Even if there are no gross anatomical dimorphisms, male and female brain circuitry must be somewhat different to account for sex-specifi c behaviors, whether singing by male birds or human sexual behavior. Recall that the kinds of sex homones circulating in the blood are determined by the gonads, and the dmorphism of the gonads is ordinarily specifi ed by our genes. As described earlier, people with a Y chromosome express a factor (testis-determining factor) that causes the undifferentiated gonads to become testes; people lacking a Y chromosome do not produce TDF, and their gonads differentate into ovaries. The differentiation of testes or ovaries sets off a cascade of developmental events in the body. Most importantly for the sexual diferentiation of the brain, the testes produce androgens, which trigger the masculinization of the nervous system by regulating the expression of a variety of sex-related genes. In the absence of androgens, there is a femnization of the brain through a different pattern of gene expression. There is nothing fundamentally unique about the brain’s sensitivity to hormones. It is just one more body tissue waiting for a hormonal signal to decide its specifi c pattern of growth and development. Androgens provide a unitary signal for masculinization in the brain, just as in the various other tissues of the body that are sexually dimorphic. Steroids can infl uence nerons in two general ways (Figure 17.16). First, they can act quickly (within seconds or less) to alter membrane excitability, sensitivity to neurotranmitters, or neurotransmitter release",

    "chunk_text": ". First, they can act quickly (within seconds or less) to alter membrane excitability, sensitivity to neurotranmitters, or neurotransmitter release. Steroids do this, in general, by directly binding to, and modulating the functions of, various enzymes, channels, and transmitter receptors. For example, certain metabolites (breakdown products) of progesterone bind to the inhibitory GABA A receptor and potetiate the amount of chloride current activated by GABA. The effects of these progesterone metabolites are quite similar to the sedative and anticonvusant effects of the benzodiazepine class of drugs (see Figure 6.22). Second, steroids can diffuse across the outer membrane and bind to specifi c types of steroid receptors in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Receptors with bound stroid can either promote or inhibit the transcription of specifi c genes in the nucleus, a process that can take minutes to hours. Specifi c receptors exist for each type of sex hormone, and the distributions of each receptor type vary widely throughout the brain (see Figure 17.6). Steroid hormones can exert effects on the brain and body throughout life, but their infl uence early in development is often fundamentally diffeent from their effects after the animal is mature. For example, the ability of testosterone to alter very young genitals and brain circuitry, leading to ditinctly male genitals and masculine behaviors later in life, can be thought of as the organizational effects of the hormone. The hormone organizes the perinatal tissues in irreversible ways that allow it to generate male functions after sexual maturity has been reached. For a mature animal to express sexual behaviors fully, however, it is often necessary for steroid hormones to circulate again during periods of sexual activity, providing ativational effects on the nervous system",

Prenatally, elevated testosterone leels are essential for the development of the male reproductive system. 600 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR Ironically, it is a “female” hormone, not testosterone, which causes the changes in gene expression responsible for masculinization of the male brain. Remember that testosterone is converted within neuronal cytplasm into estradiol in a single chemical step, catalyzed by the enzyme aromatase (see Figure 17.5). The rise in testosterone that occurs prentally actually leads to an increase in estrogen, which binds to estradiol receptors, thereby triggering masculinization of the developing nervous system. What is not clear is which genes are regulated in various parts of the brain by sex hormones to account for masculinization. Female gonads do not produce an early surge of testosterone or estrogen, so female brains are not affected in the same way as male brains. An interesting and important complication arises regarding the response of the fetal brain to circulating hormones. In addition to the estrogens and androgens produced by the fetal gonads, hormones coming from the prenant mother’s placenta reach the circulation of the fetus. A reasonable question is why estrogens from the mother do not alter sexual development of the fetal brain",

Singing is strictly a male function in many species, performed for the purpose of attracting and keeping a mate and for warning off potetial rivals. Studies of two bird species with different habits of reproduction and singing have revealed some fascinating clues about the control and diversity of sexual dimorphisms in the brain. Zebra fi nches, which are popular pets, live in the wild in the harsh Australian desert. To breed successfully, birds require dependable sources of food, but in the desert, food comes only with sporadic and unpredictable rains. Zebra fi nches must therefore be ready and willing to breed whenever food and a mate are available, in any season. Wild canaries, on the other hand, live in the more prdictable environment of the Azores and (where else?) the Canary Islands. They breed seasonally during spring and summer and do not reproduce during fall and winter",

The males of both species are passionate singers, but they difer greatly in the size of their repertoires. Zebra fi nches belt out one simple ditty all their lives and cannot learn new ones. Canaries learn many elaborate songs, and they add new ones each spring. The different behaviors of zebra fi nches and canaries require different mechanisms of neral control. The birds’ sexually dimorphic behavior—singing—is geerated by dramatically dimorphic neural structures. Birds sing by forcing air past a special muscularized organ called the syrinx , which encircles the air passage. The muscles of the syrinx are activated by motor neurons of the nucleus of crnial nerve XII, which are in turn controlled by a set of higher nuclei collectively called the vocal control regions , or VCRs (Figure A). In zebra fi nches and canaries, VCR size is fi ve or more times larger in males than in females. The development of VCRs and singing behavior is under the control of steroid hormones. However, the very diffeent seasonal requirements of zebra fi nches and canaries are paralleled by distinctly different modes of steroidal control. Zebra fi nches apparently require early doses of steroids to organize their VCRs, and later androgens to activate them. If a hatchling female zebra fi nch is exposed to testosterone or estradiol, her VCRs will be larger than those of normal fmales when she reaches adulthood. If the masculinized fmale is given more testosterone as an adult, her VCRs will grow larger still, and she will then sing like a male. Females that are not exposed to steroids when young are unresposive to testosterone as adults. In contrast, the song system in canaries seems to be independent of early steroid exposure, yet it bursts into full service each spring. If female canaries are given androgens for the fi rst time as adults, they will begin singing within a few weeks",

The androgens of males surge naturally each spring; their VCRs double in size as neurons grow larger dendrites and more synapses, and singing commences. Remarkably, neurogenesis , the birth of neurons, continues throughout adulthood in songbird brains, further contributing to the VCR circuitry during the mating season. By fall, male androgen leels drop, and the canary song system shrinks in size as his singing abates. In a sense, the male canary rebuilds much of his song control system anew each year as courtship begins. This may enable him to learn new songs more easily and, with his enlarged repertoire, gain some advantage in attracing a mate.

As odd as it sounds, the female fetus must be protected from “female hormones” to keep its brain from becoming more masculine. Knockout mice that lack -fetoprotein are sterile and do not exhibit normal sexual behaviors. The role of -fetoprotein in humans is less clear; there are confl icting reports about whether human -fetoprotein binds estrogen as it does in rodents. Also noteworthy is the dagnostic measurement of -fetoprotein levels in maternal blood or amniotic fl uid; unusually high levels are a possible indicator of neural tube defects, and unusually low levels are found in Down syndrome . A study by Amateau and McCarthy shows that one factor in brain masculinization “downstream” from testosterone and estradiol is the prduction of prostaglandins . Prostaglandins are compounds derived from arachidonic acid, a fatty acid present in the brain and other organs. One of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins is cyclooxgenase (COX)",

One of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins is cyclooxgenase (COX). Prostaglandins have numerous roles; most notably, they are produced after tissue damage and are involved in inducing pain and fever. Amateau and McCarthy found that fetal and neonatal male rats exposed to COX inhibitors showed reduced copulatory behavior as adults. Conversely, female rats treated with COX inhibitors exhibited male-like copulatory behaviors; the female rat behavior, and brain, were partially masculinized despite the lack of the usual sex hormones playing this role, thus moving us one step downstream from estradiol in the chain reaction that causes masculinization. A fascinating side note to this study is that human pain is frequently treated with COX inhibitors such as aspirin. Only time will tell whether a human mother’s use of analgesics during pregnancy affects the future sexual behavior of her children. Mismatches between Genetic Sex and Hormone Action. Under normal circumstances, the genetic sex of an animal or person determines hormonal function and, consequently, the sexual characteristics of the nervous system. However, in situations in which hormonal function is altered, it is possible for genetic males to have female brains and genetic females to have male brains. For example, in all mammalian species studied, treatment with tetosterone early in development leads to decreases in at least some features of adult female sexual behavior. Activating fully masculine behavior usally requires extended testosterone treatment before and after birth. If gnetically female (XX) rats are exposed to testosterone during the few days around birth, they will fail to elicit the typical female mating posture, called lordosis , when they reach maturity",

If gnetically female (XX) rats are exposed to testosterone during the few days around birth, they will fail to elicit the typical female mating posture, called lordosis , when they reach maturity. Female guinea pigs treated in utero with enough testosterone to masculinize their external genitals will, as adults, energetically mount and attempt to mate with females in estrus. In the asence of human intervention, when a cow carries twin calves that include both a male and a female, the female calf is exposed in utero to some testoterone produced by her male twin. As an adult, the female, known as a fremartin, will invariably be infertile and behave more like a bull than a cow. Some humans also experience mismatches between their chromosomes and sex hormones. For example, genetic males (XY) who carry a defetive androgen receptor gene may have profound androgen insensitivity . The androgen receptor gene is on the X chromosome; males thus have only one copy of it, and males with the defective gene cannot produce functioning androgen receptors. These individuals develop normal testes but they remain undescended in the abdomen. The testes produce ample testosterone, but outwardly these individuals appear entirely female because their tissues cannot respond to androgen; they have a vagina, a clitoris, and labia, and at puberty, they develop breasts and a female 603 CHAPTER 17 SEX AND THE BRAIN body shape. The testes also produce normal levels of Müllerian-inhibiting factor so the Müllerian duct does not develop into the female reprodutive system, the individuals do not menstruate, and they are infertile.

Occasionally, genetic females have a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) , which literally means overgrown adrenal glands preent at birth. Although they are genetically female, because their adrenal glands secrete unusually large amounts of androgens, CAH females are exposed to abnormally high levels of circulating androgens early in their development. At birth, they have normal ovaries and no testes, but their external genitals are intermediate in size between a normal clitoris and a penis. Surgery and medications are the usual treatments after birth. Nevertheless, CAH girls (and their parents) are more likely to describe their behavior as aggressive and tomboyish. As adults, most CAH women are heterosexual, but, compared to other women, a higher percentage of CAH women are homosexual. Presumably, by analogy to the animal studies, prenatal exposure to high levels of androgens causes a somewhat male-like organization of certain brain circuits in CAH women. We have to be particularly cautious about drawing conclusions about the causes of human behavior, however (Box 17.3). It is very hard to determine whether masculine behavior of a CAH female is due entirely to early androgen exposure and male-like brain dimorphisms, whether her behavior is the product of subtle differences in the way she is treated by others (particlarly parents faced with a child who has ambiguous genitals), or both.

While there is no question that hormones are extremely important in sexual dvelopment, recent research suggests that genes may sometimes be more directly involved in sexual differentiation, at least in some species. The most compelling evidence comes from studies of birds. In one particlarly dramatic study, Agate et al. examined the body and brain of a rare, naturally occurring zebra fi nch. This bird, technically a gynandromorph (meaning that it has both male and female tissues), was genetically fmale on the left side of its body and brain and genetically male on the right side (Figure 17.17). As both sides of the brain are exposed to the same circulating hormones, they should be equally masculine or feminine if hormones are entirely responsible for sexual differentiation. However, the brain areas associated with singing (see Box 17.2) were masculine on the right side and feminine on the left side, suggesting that different gene expression and not sex hormones in the two brain halves led to the brain dimorphisms. In related studies of gynandromorphic chickens, rsearchers found that most cells on the male side of the body carry male sex chromosomes and cells on the other side have female chromosomes, the result of a mutation early in development. Recently, attempts have been made to fi nd direct genetic effects on seual differentiation in mammals.

Faced with a terrible decision, David’s paents were eventually convinced that surgery combined with a female upbringing gave their child the best chance at a normal life. Dr. Money’s accounts of David’s life after his transformtion sound as if the child adapted well and became a happy normal girl. In publications, Dr. Money refers to “John” having been successfully changed into “Joan.” The case even made it into the popular press, as evidenced by a 1973 article in Time magazine: “This dramatic case provides strong suport that conventional patterns of masculine and feminine behavior can be altered. It also casts doubt on the theory that major sex differences, psychological as well as anatomcal, are immutably set by the genes at conception.” 1 At that time, dramatic societal changes were taking place in the roles of men and women, and the success of David as a female appeared to confi rm that society created gender identity as much as, or more than, biology. Unfortunately, a follow-up report revealed that David’s gender transformation was a disaster from the outset. According to David and his twin brother, David’s behavior was always much more like other boys than girls. David rbelled at wearing girls’ clothing and playing with traditional girls’ toys. Despite cosmetic surgery and female indoctrnation, as an adult, he said that he had suspected he was a boy as early as the second grade and imagined growing up to be a muscular man. As a child, David was incessantly teased and ostracized. He knew nothing about the failed cicumcision and subsequent surgery, nor the fact that he was genetically a male.

He married, aopted his wife’s children, and happily worked a physically dmanding job as a janitor in a slaughter house. In the 1990s, David collaborated on a book about his life. Tragically, after numerous traumatic events in his life, including the death of his twin brother and the breakup of his marriage, David comitted suicide in 2004 at the age of 38.

The male courts the female with an enticing set of behaviors, including orienting toward and following her, singing a courtship song, and tapping her with his forelegs before attempting to mate. The female chooses whether to accept or reject the male’s advances. Evidently, these behaviors are genetically coded, as males know how to court even if they have never seen courtship by other fl ies. Many genes may play some role in the courting behaviors, but there appear to be a very small number of critical regulatory genes (genes that regulate the expression of other genes). For example, the fru gene (short for fruitless) may be essential for male courtship behaviors. In (a) (b) Right R L R L Left (c) (d) ▲ FIGURE 17.17 Brain analysis of a gynandromorphic zebra finch.

The male CNS deveops such that male courtship behaviors automatically occur. In females without fru expression, a complete CNS also develops, but its wiring is somewhat different and female behaviors are “built in.” If the fru gene is absent in a male fl y, male courtship behaviors are signifi cantly reduced or nonexistent.

The dsx gene plays an important role in the sexual differentiation of the body (the development of male or female genitals) and also interacts with fru in controlling sexual differentiation of the CNS and sex-specifi c bhaviors. In the case of fru , the gene is either expressed (males) or not expressed (females). The dsx gene is different in that it is expressed in both males and females, but alternative splicing leads to the production of male-specifi c and female-specifi c proteins. How the frand dsx -infl enced structure of the CNS assures sex-specifi c behaviors is a challenging mystery yet to be explained in detail. The Activational Effects of Sex Hormones Long after sex hormones have determined the structure of the reprductive organs, they can have activational effects on the brain. These effects range in scale from temporary modifi cations in brain organiztion to changes in the structure of neurites. In men, testosterone has a two-way interaction with sexual behavior. On the one hand, testosterone levels rise in anticipation of a sexual act or even while fantasizing about it. Conversely, reduced testosterone levels are associated with decreased sexual interest. It has been reported that women are more likely to initate sex when estradiol levels are highest during their menstrual cycle. Through unknown mechanisms, hormone levels in both sexes infl uence the brain and an individual’s interest in sexual behavior. Brain Changes Associated with Maternal and Paternal Behavior. Patterns of sexual behavior vary over time. In some species, reproduction occurs only during a particular season, and mating may occur only during a spcifi c phase of that season. Obviously, females of all species nurse their ofspring only after birth and only temporarily",

In most animals, but not in humans, sexual attractiveness and copulation occur only during certain phases of the estrous cycle. Sexually dimorphic changes in the brain are sometimes transient or cyclical, coinciding with the sexual behavior to which they are related. In Chapter 16, we saw that appetite is controlled in part by blood levels of the hormone leptin that is secreted by fat cells: Higher leptin levels modlate cells in the hypothalamus and suppress eating. During pregnancy, the mother needs more food to supply energy for her growing fetus, and indeed, food intake increases early in pregnancy. Consequently, body fat accumlates and leptin levels rise. Paradoxically, researchers have observed in rats that even though leptin levels rise during pregnancy, appetite and food itake increase rather than decrease. This occurs because hormonal changes associated with pregnancy lead to leptin resistance in the hypothalamus. Another behavior unique to maternal rats occurs with lactation and nursing. In female rats, the somatosensory cortex contains a sensory reresentation of the ventral skin surrounding the nipples. Within a few days of the start of nursing, the tactile stimulation leads to a dramatic increase in the representation of the ventral skin (Figure 17.18) and a shrinkage 607 CHAPTER 17 SEX AND THE BRAIN of receptive fi elds to half their normal size. This interesting example of somatosensory map plasticity (see Chapter 12) appears to be temporary, as receptive fi elds are normal in size several months after weaning. Lactation also appears to lead to brain changes that reinforce this bhavior, which is critical for the survival of mammalian offspring. Despite their very different pharmacological and behavioral effects, all addictive drugs appear to enhance the infl uence of dopamine released by neurons projecting from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) into the nucleus accubens (NA) (see Box 16.5)",

In one study, fMRI scans of lactating female rats nursing their pups were copared with those of virgin female rats after an injection of cocaine. Brain activation was surprisingly similar in both, with particular activation in the NA. The hypothesis is that in both instances, there is stimulation of the dopamine system associated with reward and addiction. The tactile stimlation of the suckling pups may make nursing a reinforcing behavior to promote mother–infant bonding and, ultimately, the survival of the pups. Even though fathers do not experience the dramatic body changes assciated with pregnancy and lactation, their interactions with children may alter their brains in fundamental ways. A hint of this comes from a study in Elizabeth Gould’s lab at Princeton University, where she examined the brains of marmosets. Marmoset fathers are unusually involved in child care; indeed, they carry the babies around for the fi rst few months of life.

(Source: Adapted from Xerri et al., 1994.) 608 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR is known that across species, the prefrontal cortex is involved in complex, goal-directed behaviors. It is also established that environment can change neurons; for example, dendritic branching and spine density are enhanced when animals are housed in an enriched environment. To see whether fatherhood alters brain structure, Gould’s group compared the prefrontal cortex of marmoset fathers with that of non-fathers who were part of a mating pair. Two interesting differences were found: The density of dedritic spines on pyramidal cells was signifi cantly higher in the fathers, and there appeared to be more vasopressin receptors on the spines. The functional consequences of these changes are not known, but they suggest that brains in other species that invest much time in childrearing, whether by the male or female, might be structurally changed by the experience. Estrogen Effects on Neuron Function, Memory, and Disease. Estrogens have powerful activational effects on the structure and function of neurons. Within minutes of experimental application, estradiol alters the intrinsic excitability of neurons in a broad range of brain areas. By modulating the fl ow of potassium ions, estradiol depolarizes some neurons and causes them to fi re more action potentials. A dramatic example of the effects estrogen can have on cell structure is shown in Figure 17.19. Dominique Toran-Allerand at Columbia University found that estradiol treatment of tissue taken from the hypothalamus of newborn mice causes a great degree of neurite ougrowth. Other studies have shown that estradiol increases cell viability and spine density. Taken together, these fi ndings suggest that estrogens play an important role in forming neuronal circuitry during brain development",

Working at Rockefeller University, Elizabeth Gould, Catherine Woolley, Bruce McEwen, and their colleagues reported a fascinating example of etradiol’s activational effects. They counted dendritic spines on neurons in the hippocampus of female rats and found that the number of spines fl utuated dramatically during the 5-day estrous cycle. Spine density and etradiol levels peaked together, and treatment with injected estradiol also increased the numbers of spines in animals whose natural estradiol levels were kept low (Figure 17.20). Since spines are the major site of excitatory synapses on dendrites (see Chapter 2), this provides a possible explanation for the fact that hippocampal excitability also seems to track the estrous cycle. The hippocampus of experimental animals more easily generates seizures, for example, when estrogen levels increase (Figure 17.21). Note that estradiol and progesterone levels peak during the proestrus phase (Figure 17.21a,b) and at this time seizure thresholds are lowest (Figure 17.21c). Woolley and McEwen showed that it is indeed estradiol itself that triggers the increase in spine numbers and that as hippocampal neurons grow more spines, they also grow more excitatory synapses. How does estradiol increase the numbers of hippocampal spines and ecitatory synapses? Although the details of this mechanism are not all clear, it appears that estradiol increases the capacity for synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus in multiple ways. In the presence of estradiol, postsyaptic responses to glutamate are larger than without estradiol. As we will see in Chapter 25, such enhanced responses at excitatory synapses cause the synapses to strengthen. Estradiol may also alter hippocampal funtion by decreasing synaptic inhibition",

Estradiol may also alter hippocampal funtion by decreasing synaptic inhibition. Estradiol causes some inhibitory cells to produce less GABA, their neurotransmitter, and therefore synaptic inhibition becomes less effective. Less inhibition increases neural activity, complementing the estradiol effect at excitatory synapses. When the pieces are put together, it seems that estradiol produces a hippocampus with less effective inhibitory synapses and stronger excitatory synapses, thereby triggering an increase in the number of spines on the pyramidal cells.

(Source: ToraAllerand, 1980.) 609 CHAPTER 17 SEX AND THE BRAIN In rats, the hippocampus is particularly important for spatial memory and navigational skills, and several studies demonstrate that estradiol ehances such forms of memory formation. In these experiments, rats are trained to run a maze or remember objects or places. Estradiol administered shortly before or after training enhances performance on these tasks when they are performed again hours later as a test of memory. It is interesting to note that the memory benefi t associated with the estradiol disappears if the estrogen is given 2 hours after training. Evidently, estrogens can facilitate memory, but they must be present near in time to the learning experience. Woolley notes that the peak in hippocampal spine number coincides with the rat’s peak in fertility. During that period, the female actively seeks out mates, which may require the heightened spatial ability that might come with a more excitable, NMDA-receptor-fi lled hippocampus",

Estradiol has also been shown to have a protective effect on neurons that may help combat disease. In neuronal cultures, cells are more likely to survive hypoxia, oxidative stress, and exposure to various neurotoxic agents if they are exposed to estradiol. Clinically, estrogen appears to minimize or delay neural damage in a variety of situations. For example, it may protect against stroke in humans, although the mechanism is uclear.

Estrogen replacement therapy appears to aid in the treatment of certain neurlogical disorders.

It also appears that estrogen replacement therapy might delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease and decrease treors in Parkinson’s disease. The actions of estrogens in these diseases have been diffi cult to pin down, in part because a variety of cell types express estrogen receptors. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that the benefi ts of estrogen may come from effects on astrocytes as well as neurons.

In some sense, this must be true if we believe that all behavior is based on brain activity. However, there is no evidence that sexual orientation is related to activational effects of hormones in adults. For example, administering androgens or estrogens to adults, or removing the gonads, has no effect on sexual orientation. As an alternative, perhaps homosexual and heerosexual brains are structurally different due to organizational effects. We saw earlier that in animals, there are sex differences in the antrior hypothalamus. In rats, the SDN (sexually dimorphic nucleus) in the preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus is much larger in males than females.

After a surgical lesion to this brain area, male rats spend more time with sexually active males than with sexually receptive females, a reversal of their preference before surgery. Another piece of suggetive evidence comes from studies of Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, in which researchers estimate that about 8% of the male population prefers mounting other males rather than females. The SDN is found to be about half the size in these male-oriented rams compared to female-oriented rams. Thus, it appears that the size of hypothalamic nuclei in some anmals may correlate with sexual preference. Unfortunately, the causal rlationship between SDN size and sexual orientation is unclear. In humans, the INAH-3 nucleus (one of the interstitial nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus) is about twice as large in men as in women, a diference that may be related to sexually dimorphic behavior. Some studies of the INAH suggest that there are differences between homosexual and heterosexual brains that might be related to sexual orientation.

Collectively, these studies offer the intriguing prospect that complex aspects of human sexual behavior may ultimately be linked to distinct brain organization. However, the diffi culties involved in comparing brains, as well as the history of brain dimorphisms, suggest that caution is advised until a research consensus is reached. CONCLUDING REMARKS The subject of sex and the brain is complicated by the subtleties of the bioloical and cultural mechanisms that determine sexual behavior. Particularly in humans, anatomical differences between the female and male nervous systems are not readily apparent, and indeed, most human behavior is not distinctly masculine or feminine. Where small brain differences between the sexes occur, any adaptive purpose they may serve is not clear. And in no case is the neurobiological basis for sex differences in cognition known. Nevertheless, the essential biological imperative—reproduction— demands sex-specifi c behaviors, at least for mating and giving birth. For the most concretely sexual structures (such as the muscles and motor nerons controlling the penis or the sensory afferents innervating the clitoris), identifying some of the peripheral and spinal neural systems involved is fairly easy. The powerful role of sex hormones in sexual development and behavior is also clear. But the more complex aspects of sexual behavior and the brain systems that generate them are still quite mysterious. We have touched on only a few of the issues in the study of sex and the brain, and most of the basic questions remain unanswered",

Discuss the kinds of evidence you would need to accept these claims about (a) the existence of a dimorphism, (b) the defi nitions of uniquely male behaviors, and (c) the involvement of nucleus X in these sexual behaviors.
