Temperature, precipitation, and day- light vary with the seasons; light and dark trade places each day; tides ebb and ﬂ ow. To compete effectively and survive, an animal’s behavior must oscillate with the cadences of its environment. Brains have evolved a variety of systems for rhythmic control. Sleeping and waking are the most striking periodic behavior. But some rhythms controlled by the brain have much longer periods, as in hibernating animals, and many have shorter periods, such as the cycles of breathing, the steps of walking, the repetitive stages of one night’s sleep, and the electrical rhythms of the cerebral cortex. The functions of some rhythms are obvious, while others are obscure, and some rhythms indicate pathology. In this chapter, we explore selected brain rhythms, beginning with the fast and proceeding to the slow. The forebrain, especially the cere- bral cortex, produces a range of rapid electrical rhythms that are easily measured and that closely correlate with interesting behaviors, including sleep. We discuss the electroencephalogram, or EEG, because it is the classical method of recording brain rhythms and is essential for study- ing sleep. Sleep is explored in detail because it is complex, ubiquitous, and so dear to our hearts. Finally, we summarize what is known about the timers that regulate the everyday ups and downs of our hormones, body temperature, alertness, and metabolism. Almost all physiological functions change according to daily cycles known as circadian rhythms . The clocks that time circadian rhythms are in the brain, calibrated by the sun via the visual system, and they profoundly inﬂ uence our health and well-being. THE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM Sometimes the forest is more interesting than the trees. Similarly, we are often less concerned with the activities of single neurons than with understanding the activity of a large population of neurons. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a measurement of electrical activity from the surface of the scalp that enables us to glimpse the general- ized activity of the cerebral cortex. The roots of the EEG lie in work done by English physiologist Richard Caton in 1875. Caton made electri- cal recordings from the surface of dog and rabbit brains using a primi- tive device sensitive to voltage. The human EEG was ﬁ rst described by Austrian psychiatrist Hans Berger in 1929, who observed that waking and sleeping EEGs are distinctly different. Figure 19.1 shows one of his ﬁ rst published records, taken from the head of his 15-year-old son, Klaus. Today, the EEG is used primarily to help diagnose certain neu- rological conditions, especially the seizures of epilepsy, and for research purposes, notably to study the stages of sleep and cognitive processes during wakefulness.

EEG 10 Hz time signal \n647 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP Recording Brain Waves Recording an EEG is relatively simple. The method is usually nonin- vasive and is painless. Countless people have slept through entire nights wearing EEG electrodes in the comfort of sleep research laboratories (Figure 19.2). The electrodes are wires taped to the scalp, along with con- ductive paste to ensure a low-resistance connection. Figure 19.3 shows a common EEG conﬁ guration, in which some two dozen electrodes are ﬁ xed to standard positions on the head and connected to banks of ampli- ﬁ ers and recording devices. Small voltage ﬂ uctuations, usually a few tens of microvolts ( \u0002 V) in amplitude, are measured between selected pairs of electrodes. Different regions of the brain—anterior and posterior, left and right—can be examined by selecting the appropriate electrode pairs. The typical EEG record is a set of many simultaneous squiggles, indicating voltage changes between pairs of electrodes. What part of the nervous system generates the ﬂ uctuations and oscilla- tions of an EEG? For the most part, an EEG measures voltages  generated by the currents that ﬂ ow during synaptic excitation of the dendrites of many pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex, which lies right under the skull and makes up most of the brain’s mass. But the electrical contribu- tion of any single cortical neuron is exceedingly small, and the signal must penetrate several layers of non-neural tissue, including the meninges, ﬂ uid, bones of the skull, and skin, to reach the electrodes (Figure 19.4). Therefore, it takes many thousands of underlying neurons, activated to- gether, to generate an EEG signal big enough to be measured at all. This has an interesting consequence: The amplitude of the EEG sig- nal strongly depends, in part, on how synchronous is the activity of the underlying neurons. When a group of cells is excited simultaneously, the tiny signals sum to generate one larger surface signal. However, when each cell receives the same amount of excitation but the excitations are spread out in time, the summed signals are meager and irregular (Figure 19.5). Notice that in this case, the number of activated cells and the total amount of excitation may not have changed, only the timing of the activity. If synchronous excitation of this group of cells is repeated again and again, the resulting EEG will consist of large, rhythmic waves. We often describe ▲ FIGURE 19.2 A subject in a sleep research study. The subject shown here is American sleep researcher Nathaniel Kleitman, codiscoverer of REM sleep.

An alternative way to record the rhythms of the cerebral cortex is with magnetoencephalography (MEG) . Recall from physics that whenever electrical current ﬂ ows, a magnetic ﬁ eld is generated according to the “right hand rule” (hold up your right hand loosely; if your thumb points in the direction of electrical current ﬂ ow, the rest of your curling ﬁ ngers indicate the direction of the magnetic ﬁ eld). It stands to reason that when neurons generate currents, as in Figure 19.4, they should also produce a magnetic ﬁ eld. But the magnetic ﬁ eld they generate is minuscule. Even the strongest brain activity, with many synchronously active neurons contributing, produces a ﬁ eld strength just one billionth that of the mag- netic ﬁ eld generated by the Earth, nearby power lines, and the movement of distant metal objects such as elevators and cars. Detecting the brain’s inﬁ nitesimal magnetic signals in the midst of those relatively immense sources of environmental magnetic “noise” is analogous to listening for the footsteps of a mouse in the middle of a rock concert! It requires a spe- cially screened room to shield out the magnetic noise and a large, expen- sive instrument with highly sensitive magnetic detectors that are cooled with liquid helium to –269°C (Figure 19.6). The capabilities of MEG complement those of other methods that measure brain function. MEG is much better than EEG at localizing the sources of neural activity in the brain, particularly those deep below the surface. Like EEG, MEG can record rapid ﬂ uctuations of neural activity that are much too fast to be detected by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or Pia mater Efferent axon Subarachnoid space Arachnoid Dura mater Skull Scalp EEG electrode Amplifier EEG Active synapse Afferent axon ▲ FIGURE 19.4 The generation of very small electrical fields by synaptic currents in pyramidal cells. In this case, the active synapse is on the upper part of the dendrite. When the afferent axon fires, the presynaptic terminal releases glutamate, which opens cation channels. Positive current flows into the dendrite, leaving a slight negativ- ity in the extracellular fluid. Current spreads down the dendrite and escapes from its deeper parts, leaving the fluid slightly positive at those sites. The EEG electrode (referred to a second electrode some distance away)  measures this pat- tern through thick  tissue layers. Only if thousands of cells contribute their small voltage is the  signal large enough to reach the scalp surface. (Notice the EEG convention of plotting the signals with negativity upward.) \n649 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP (b) (c) (a) Irregular Synchronized EEG electrode 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 Sum = EEG Sum = EEG 1 2 3 4 6 5 ▲ FIGURE 19.5 The generation of large EEG signals by synchronous activity.

This isn’t the puzzle I set out to solve at the start of my career. My analytic nature led me to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics at Boston University. I intended to study the mathematics of chaos, but as with many careers my path diverged unexpectedly. A year into my graduate study, mathematician Nancy Kopell established the Center for BioDynamics, catalyzing growing interest in the applica- tions of dynamical systems theory to the study of biological phenomena, including neuroscience. After attending a few neuroscience lectures, I knew this was a puzzle I wanted to help solve. To my good fortune, Nancy took me on as a stu- dent. I began using mathematics to study rhythmic activity in simpliﬁ ed representations of neural circuits, such as the cen- tral pattern-generating network that regulates crayﬁ sh swim- ming. By the time I ﬁ nished my mathematics Ph.D., I was passionate about neuroscience. I knew I wanted to apply my knowledge to understand human brain dynamics. Little did I know just how many pieces are in that puzzle! For the next decade, I studied human brain rhythms using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in the brain-imaging center at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). At MGH, my path of discovery was again shaped by the gift of fantastic mentors and colleagues. The ﬁ rst is my now close colleague, neurophysiologist Chris Moore, who was himself a postdoctoral fellow at the time. Chris enlightened me to the nuances of neuroscience and to the idea that the somatosensory system was the “ideal system to study” because of its puzzle-like topographical representation of the body, the homunculus (see Figure 12.19). With MEG we began studying tactile perception, such as the detection of light taps to the ﬁ ngertips, in humans. Chris’s notion that this system was “ideal” was fortuitous, as was revealed in a surprising way through the mentorship of physicist Matti Hämäläinen, director of the MEG center. Matti taught me the ins and outs of MEG data collection and, importantly, the electromagnetic physics underlying these brain signals. I learned that the intracellular cur- rents within the long, aligned dendrites of pyramidal neurons are the primary generators of the recorded magnetic ﬁ eld signals. Further, the pyramidal neurons in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) are “ideally” oriented to produce strong MEG signals during ﬁ nger taps that can be reliably localized to the hand representa- tion in S1. This enabled us to do careful studies of the neural generators of brain rhythms. P A T H  O F  D I S C O V E R Y BOX 19.1 The Puzzle of Brain Rhythms positron emission tomography (PET) (see Box 7.3). MEG cannot provide the spatially detailed images of fMRI, however. Another important distinction is that EEG and MEG directly measure the activity of neurons, whereas fMRI and PET detect changes in blood ﬂ ow or metabolism, which are controlled in part by neuronal activity but which may also be inﬂ uenced by other physi- ological factors. MEG is currently being used in experimental studies of the human brain and its cognitive functions and as an aid in the diagnosis of epilepsy and language disorders (Box 19.1). EEG Rhythms EEG rhythms vary dramatically and often correlate with particular states of behavior (such as level of attentiveness, sleeping, or waking) and pathol- ogy (seizures or coma). Figure 19.7 shows part of a normal EEG. The brain can generate rhythms that are as slow as about 0.05 Hz and as fast as 500 Hz or more. The main EEG rhythms are categorized by their frequency range, and each range is named after a Greek letter. Delta rhythms are slow, less than 4 Hz, are often large in amplitude, and are a hallmark of deep sleep. Theta rhythms are 4–7 Hz and can occur during both sleeping and waking states. Alpha rhythms are about 8–13 Hz, are largest over the occipital cortex, and are associated with quiet, waking states; Mu rhythms are similar in frequency to alpha rhythms but are largest over the motor \n651 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP As with all MEG (and EEG) recordings, the dominant activities from S1 are low-frequency, large-amplitude rhythms, including the beta rhythms of 15–29 Hz. We discovered that when a subject directs her attention to her ﬁ nger before it is tapped, the beta rhythms in the hand area of S1 decrease compared to when her attention is directed elsewhere. Attention and re- duced beta rhythms correlated with an increase in the subject’s ability to feel a light tap. Our results were similar to previous ﬁ ndings in the visual cortex, suggesting that beta rhythms may signal inhibitory processes in sensory areas of cortex. But why? What is it about these rhythms, if anything, that links them to decreased perception? And why, in conditions like Parkinson’s disease, are beta rhythms over-expressed in motor cortex with a corresponding decrease in motor actions? To address this piece of the puzzle, I turned to my mathematics roots and began constructing a computational neural model to study the origins of these rhythms. My prior research had given me solid intuitions about how stable rhythms can emerge from neural circuits. However, after much exploration using simpliﬁ ed mathematical representa- tions of neural circuits (e.g., collapsing the activity of an en- tire neuron to a single point), I realized these models simply could not reproduce signals that resembled the recordings. Next, I drew on the pioneering work of Yoshio Okada, who combined experimental and mathematical modeling to un- derstand MEG signals from pyramidal neurons. Equipped with my new knowledge of the biophysics underlying MEG, I constructed more complex models that included details of the structure and physiology of pyramidal neurons and other cortical neuron types. This endeavor spanned several years that also included the birth of the ﬁ rst of my three children. To my delight, the detailed model yielded novel and non- intuitive predictions about rhythms. Speciﬁ cally, it predicted that beta rhythms emerge from the integration of two sets of synaptic inputs that are roughly synchronous and that excite different parts of pyramidal cell dendrites. These inputs drive alternating electrical currents up and down within the dendrites to reproduce rhythms remarkably consistent with recordings. The model not only accounted for many features of the MEG rhythms in S1 but also suggested how these rhythms inﬂ uence sensory processing. I subsequently tested these secondary predictions with the MEG data, and to my surprise they were conﬁ rmed! This discovery was thrilling since the mathematical model was now predicting what the data from new experiments would look like. Finally, pieces of the puzzle were ﬁ tting together! The close agreement between the model’s output and the recorded human data gives us conﬁ dence in the model’s predictions about how neurons generate beta rhythms. More importantly, the model suggests how rhythms inﬂ uence brain function. Through continued collaboration with Chris Moore and other neurophysiologists and neurosurgeons, we are currently testing model-derived predictions with electrode re- cordings. We may discover the pieces do not ﬁ t together ex- actly as the model suggests. However, through collaboration and the interplay of interdisciplinary methods, I am convinced we can build interpretive bridges between neural activity and human brain functions. Solving the puzzle of brain rhythms will be an important and exciting step along the way. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 50 μ V Electrode positions Blink artifacts Time (sec) Alpha rhythms Beta rhythms FIGURE 19.7 A normal EEG.

Beta rhythms are about 15–30 Hz. Gamma rhythms are relatively fast, ranging from about 30–90 Hz, and signal an activated or attentive cortex. Additional rhythms include spindles , brief 8–14 Hz waves associated with sleep, and ripples , brief bouts of 80–200 Hz oscillations. An interesting feature of EEG rhythms is that their char- acteristics are remarkably similar across mammalian brains from mice to humans, despite 17,000-fold differences in brain mass (Figure 19.8). \n652 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR Brain weight (g) 10 -1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 sec Alpha rhythms (neocortex) Spindles (neocortex) Ripples (hippocampus) 350 msec Frequency (Hz) 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 Slow 3 Ripple Gamma Spindle Alpha Theta Slow 1 Chimp Dog Rabbit Rat Bat Gerbil Sheep Baboon Pig Human Cat Mouse Hamster Guinea pig Macaque (a) (b) K-complex \n653 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP While analysis of an EEG cannot tell us what a person is thinking, it can help us know if a person is thinking. In general, high-frequency, low-amplitude rhythms are associated with alertness and waking, or the dreaming stages of sleep. Low-frequency, high-amplitude rhythms are as- sociated with nondreaming sleep states, certain drugged states, or the pathological condition of coma. This is logical because when the cortex is most actively engaged in processing information, whether generated by sensory input or by internal processes, the activity level of cortical neu- rons is relatively high but also relatively unsynchronized. In other words, each neuron, or a very small group of neurons, is vigorously involved in a slightly different aspect of a complex cognitive task; it ﬁ res rapidly but not quite simultaneously with most of its neighbors. This leads to low synchrony, so EEG amplitude is low, and gamma and beta rhythms domi- nate. In contrast, during deep sleep, cortical neurons are not engaged in information processing, and large numbers of them are phasically excited by a common, slow, rhythmic input. In this case, synchrony is high, so EEG amplitude is high. Mechanisms and Meanings of Brain Rhythms Electrical rhythms abound in the cerebral cortex. But how are they gen- erated, and what functions, if any, do they perform? Let’s take a look at each of these questions. The Generation of Synchronous Rhythms. The activity of a large set of neurons will produce synchronized oscillations in one of two fundamental ways: (1) They may all take their cues from a central clock, or pacemaker , or (2) they may share or distribute the timing function among themselves by mutually exciting or inhibiting one another. The ﬁ rst mechanism is analogous to a band with a leader, with each musician playing in strict time to the beat of the leader’s baton (Figure 19.9a). The second mecha- nism is more subtle because the timing arises from the collective behavior of the cortical neurons themselves. Musically, it is more like a jam session (Figure 19.9b). The concept of shared synchronous rhythm can be easily demonstrated by a group of people, even nonmusical ones. Simply tell them to begin clapping, but give them no instructions about how fast to clap or whose beat to follow. Almost immediately they will all be clapping in synchrony! How? By listening and watching each other, they will adjust their clap- ping rates to match. A key factor is person-to-person interaction; in a network of neurons, these interactions occur via synaptic connections. People naturally tend to clap within a narrow range of frequencies, so they don’t have to adjust their timing very far in order to clap in syn- chrony. Likewise, some neurons may ﬁ re at certain frequencies much more than others. This kind of collective, organized behavior can gener- ate rhythms of impressive dimensions, which can move in space and time. Have you ever been part of a human wave in the stands of a sold-out football stadium? Many different circuits of neurons can generate rhythmic activity. A very simple model oscillator, consisting of just one excitatory and one inhibitory neuron, is shown in Figure 19.10. Most real neural oscillators include far more neurons but similar basic features: a source of constant excitatory drive, feedback connections, and synaptic excitation and inhibition. Within the mammalian brain, rhythmic, synchronous activity is usu- ally coordinated by a combination of the pacemaker and collective meth- ods. For example, the thalamus, with its massive input to all of the (a) (b) ▲ FIGURE 19.9 Two mechanisms of synchronous rhythms. Synchronous rhythms can (a) be led by a pacemaker or (b) arise from the collective behavior of all participants. \n654 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR cortex, can act as a powerful pacemaker. Under certain conditions, tha- lamic neurons can generate very rhythmic action potential discharges (Figure 19.11). But how do thalamic neurons oscillate? Some thalamic cells have a particular set of voltage-gated ion channels that allow each cell to generate very rhythmic, self-sustaining discharge patterns even when there is no external input to the cell. The rhythmic activity of each thalamic pacemaker neuron then becomes synchronized with many other thalamic cells via a hand-clapping kind of collective interaction. Synaptic connections between excitatory and inhibitory thalamic neu- rons force each individual neuron to conform to the rhythm of the group. These coordinated rhythms are then passed to the cortex by the thala- mocortical axons, which excite cortical neurons. In this way, a relatively small group of centralized thalamic cells (acting as the band leader) can compel a much larger group of cortical cells (acting as the band) to march to the thalamic beat (Figure 19.12). Some rhythms of the cerebral cortex do not depend on a thalamic pacemaker but rely instead on the collective, cooperative interactions of cortical neurons themselves. In this case, the excitatory and inhibitory interconnections of the neurons result in a coordinated, synchronous pat- tern of activity that may remain localized or spread to encompass larger regions of cortex.

One excitatory cell (E cell) and one inhibitory cell (I cell) synapse upon each another. As long as there is a constant excitatory drive (which does not have to be rhythmic) onto the E cell, activity will tend to trade back and forth between the two neu- rons. One activity cycle through the net- work will generate the pattern of firing shown in the dashed box. 0 Stimulus current (b) (a) –60 –60 –30 –30 0 +30 +30 Time (msec) Membrane potential (mV) Membrane potential (mV) 200 600 1000 1400 1800 ▲ FIGURE 19.11 A one-neuron oscillator.

Cortical rhythms are fascinating to watch in an EEG, and they parallel so many interesting human behaviors that we are compelled to ask: Why so many rhythms? More importantly, do they serve a purpose? There are no satisfactory answers yet. Ideas abound, but deﬁ nitive evidence is scarce. One hypothesis for sleep-related rhythms is that they are the brain’s way of disconnecting the cortex from sensory input. When you are awake, the thalamus allows sensory information to pass through it and be relayed up to the cortex. When you are asleep, thalamic neurons enter a self-generated rhythmic state that prevents or- ganized sensory information from being relayed to the cortex. While this idea has intuitive appeal (most people do prefer to sleep in a dark, quiet environment), it does not explain why rhythms are necessary. Why not just steadily inhibit the thalamus and allow the cortex to rest quietly? A function for fast rhythms in the awake cortex has also been pro- posed. One scheme for understanding visual perception takes advantage of the fact that cortical neurons responding to the same object are syn- chronously active. Walter Freeman, a neurobiologist at the University of California, Berkeley, pioneered the idea that neural rhythms are used to coordinate activity between regions of the nervous system. Both sensory and motor systems of the awake brain often generate bursts of synchro- nous neural activity that give rise to EEG gamma rhythms (30–90 Hz). By momentarily synchronizing the fast oscillations generated by dif- ferent regions of cortex, perhaps the brain binds together various neural components into a single perceptual construction. For example, when you are trying to catch a basketball, different groups of neurons that simul- taneously respond to the speciﬁ c shape, color, movement, distance, and even the signiﬁ cance of the basketball tend to oscillate synchronously. The fact that the oscillations of these scattered groups of cells (those that together encode “basketballness”) are highly synchronous would some- how tag them as a meaningful group, distinct from other nearby neurons, thereby unifying the disjointed neural pieces of the “basketball puzzle.” The evidence for this idea is indirect, far from proven, and understand- ably controversial. For now, the functions of rhythms in the cerebral cortex are largely a mystery. One plausible hypothesis is that most rhythms have no direct function. Instead, they may be intriguing but unimportant by-products of the tendency for brain circuits to be strongly interconnected, with various forms of excitatory feedback. When something excites itself, whether it is an audio ampliﬁ er or the human stadium wave, it often leads to insta- bility or oscillation. Feedback circuits are essential for the cortex to do all the marvelous things it does for us. Oscillations may be the unavoid- able consequence of so much feedback circuitry, unwanted but tolerated by necessity. Even if they don’t have a function, however, EEG rhythms provide us with a convenient window on the functional states of the brain. The Seizures of Epilepsy Seizures, the most extreme form of synchronous brain activity, are always a sign of pathology. A generalized seizure involves the entire cerebral cortex of both hemispheres. A partial seizure involves only a circum- scribed area of the cortex. In both cases, the neurons within the affected areas ﬁ re with a synchrony that never occurs during normal behavior. As a consequence, seizures are usually accompanied by very large EEG patterns. The cerebral cortex, probably because of its extensive feedback circuitry, is never far from the runaway excitation we know as a seizure. Isolated seizures are not uncommon during a lifetime, and 7–10% of peo- Cortex Thalamus Output pathways Afferent pathways ▲ FIGURE 19.12 Rhythms in the thalamus drive rhythms in the cerebral cortex. The thalamus can generate rhythmic activity because of the intrinsic properties of its neurons and because of its synaptic interconnections.

When a person ex- periences repeated seizures, the condition is known as epilepsy . About 0.7% of people worldwide (50 million) have epilepsy. Epilepsy is more common in developing countries, particularly in rural areas, presumably because of higher rates of untreated childhood epilepsy, infections, and poor pre- and postnatal care. The diagnosis of epilepsy occurs most often in young children and among the elderly (Figure 19.13). Childhood epi- lepsy is usually congenital, caused by genes or a disease or abnormality present at birth, whereas the elderly tend to acquire epilepsy as a conse- quence of conditions such as stroke, tumors, or Alzheimer’s disease. Epilepsy is more a symptom of disease than a disease itself. Its causes can sometimes be identiﬁ ed, including tumors, trauma, genetics, meta- bolic dysfunction, infection, and vascular disease, but in many cases, the cause of epilepsy is not known. Different types of seizures have different underlying mechanisms. Some forms of epilepsy show a genetic predis- position, and many of the genes responsible have been identiﬁ ed. These genes code for a diverse array of proteins, including ion channels, trans- porters, receptors, and signaling molecules. Several mutations of genes that encode for sodium channel proteins, for example, have been linked to rare familial forms of epilepsy. These mutated sodium channels tend to stay open a bit longer than normal, allowing more sodium current to enter the neurons and thus making neurons hyperexcitable. Another group of mutations that lead to epilepsy impair synaptic inhibition medi- ated by GABA by affecting its receptors, enzymes critical for its synthesis or transport, or proteins involved in its release. Research suggests that some seizures reﬂ ect an upset of the delicate balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition in the brain. Other seizures may be due to excessively strong or dense excitatory interconnections. Drugs that block GABA receptors are very potent convulsants (seizure- promoting agents). The withdrawal of chronic depressant drugs, such as alcohol or barbiturates, may also trigger seizures. A variety of drugs are useful for the therapeutic suppression of seizures, and these anticonvul- sants tend to counter excitability in various ways. For example, some act by prolonging the inhibitory actions of GABA (e.g., barbiturates and ben- zodiazepines [see Figure 6.22]), while others decrease the tendency for certain neurons to ﬁ re action potentials at a high frequency (e.g., phe- nytoin and carbamazepine). The behavioral features of a seizure depend on the neurons involved and the patterns of their activity. During most forms of generalized sei- zures, virtually all cortical neurons participate, so behavior is completely Age (years) Incidence of new epilepsy cases per 100,000 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 50 100 150 200 250 300 FIGURE 19.13 Incidence of epilepsy by age.

Consciousness is lost, while all muscle groups may be driven by tonic (ongoing) activity or by clonic (rhyth- mic) patterns, or by both in sequence, the so-called tonic–clonic seizure . Absence seizures characterize a childhood form of epilepsy, consisting of less than 30 seconds of generalized, 3 Hz EEG waves accompanied by loss of consciousness. An EEG recorded during an absence seizure illustrates several very striking abnormalities (Figure 19.14). The voltage patterns are extraordinarily large, regular, and rhythmic and are generated syn- chronously across the entire brain. Despite this dramatic pattern of ac- tivity, the motor signs of an absence seizure are strangely subtle, only ﬂ uttering eyelids or a twitching mouth. Partial seizures can be instructive. If they begin in a small area of motor cortex, they can cause clonic movement of part of a limb. In the late 1800s, British neurologist John Hughlings Jackson observed the progres- sion of seizure-related movements across the body, looked at the lesions ▲ FIGURE 19.14 An EEG of a generalized epileptic seizure.

If seizures begin in a sensory area, they can trigger an abnormal sensation, or aura , such as an odd smell or sparkling lights. Most bizarre are the partial seizures that elicit more well-formed auras such as déjà vu (the feeling that something has happened before) or hallucinations. Sometimes involving the cortex of the temporal lobes, including the hippocampus and amygdala, they can impair memory, thought, and consciousness. In some cases, partial seizures may spread uncontrollably and become generalized seizures. SLEEP Sleep and dreams—they are mysterious, even mystical to some people, and a favorite subject of art and literature, philosophy, and science. Sleep is a powerful master. Each night we abandon our companions, our work, and our play and enter the cloister of sleep. We have only limited control over the decision; we can postpone sleep for a while, but eventually it overwhelms us. We spend about one-third of our lives sleeping, and one- quarter of that time in a state of active dreaming. Sleep may be universal among higher vertebrates and perhaps among all animals. Research suggests that even the fruit ﬂ y, Drosophila , sleeps. Prolonged sleep deprivation is devastating to proper functioning, at least temporarily, and in some animals (such as rats and cockroaches, though probably not in humans), it may even cause death. Sleep is essential to our lives, almost as important as eating and breathing. But why do we sleep? What purpose does it serve? Despite many years of research, the joke remains that the only thing we are sure of is that sleep overcomes sleepiness. But one of the wonderful things about science is that the lack of consensus inspires a ﬂ ourishing of theories, and sleep research is no exception. We can still describe what we cannot explain, and sleep has been richly studied. Let’s begin with a deﬁ nition: Sleep is a readily reversible state of reduced responsiveness to, and interaction with, the environment. (Coma and general anesthesia are not readily reversible and do not qualify as sleep.) In the sections that follow, we discuss the phenomenology and neural mechanisms of sleep and dreaming. The Functional States of the Brain During a normal day, you experience two very different and noticeable types of behavior: waking and sleeping. It is much less obvious that your sleep also has very distinct phases or states. Several times during a night, you enter a state called rapid eye movement sleep , or REM sleep , when your EEG looks more awake than asleep, your body (except for your eye and respiratory muscles) is immobilized, and you conjure up the vivid, detailed illusions we call dreams. The rest of the time, you spend in a state called non-REM sleep , in which the brain does not usually gener- ate complex dreams. (Non-REM sleep is also sometimes called slow-wave sleep because of its domination by large, slow EEG rhythms.) These fun- damental behavioral states—awake, non-REM sleep, and REM sleep— are produced by three distinct states of brain function (Table 19.1). Each behavioral state is also accompanied by large shifts in body function. Non-REM sleep seems to be a period for rest. Muscle tension through- out the body is reduced, and movement is minimal. It is important to realize that the body is capable of movement during non-REM sleep but S L E E P \n659 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP only rarely does the brain command it to move, usually to brieﬂ y adjust the body’s position. The temperature and energy consumption of the body are lowered. Because of an increase in activity of the parasympathetic division of the ANS, heart rate, respiration, and kidney function all slow down, and digestive processes speed up. During non-REM sleep, the brain also seems to rest. Its rate of energy use, and the general ﬁ ring rates of its neurons, is at their lowest point of the day. The slow, large-amplitude EEG rhythms indicate that the neurons of the cortex are oscillating in relatively high synchrony, and ex- periments suggest that most sensory input cannot even reach the  cortex. While there is no way to know for certain what people are  thinking when they are asleep, studies indicate that mental processes also hit their daily low during the non-REM state. When awakened, people often recall noth- ing, or only brief, fragmentary, plausible thoughts with few visual images. Detailed, entertaining, irrational dreams are rare, although not absent, during non-REM sleep. William Dement, a pioneering sleep researcher at Stanford University, characterizes non-REM sleep as an idling brain in a movable body . In contrast, Dement calls REM sleep an active, hallucinating brain in a paralyzed body. REM sleep is dreaming sleep. Although the REM period accounts for only a small part of our sleep time, it is the part most researchers get excited about (and this is the state that most excites the brain), perhaps because dreams are so intriguing and enigmatic. If you awaken someone during REM sleep, as Dement, Eugene Aserinsky, and Nathaniel Kleitman ﬁ rst did in the mid-1950s, the person will likely report visually detailed, lifelike episodes, often with bizarre story lines— the kinds of dreams we love to talk about and try to interpret. The physiology of REM sleep is also bizarre. The EEG looks almost indistinguishable from that of an active, waking brain, with fast, low- voltage ﬂ uctuations. This is why REM sleep is sometimes referred to as paradoxical sleep . In fact, the oxygen consumption of the brain (a mea- sure of its energy use) is higher in REM sleep than when the brain is awake and concentrating on difﬁ cult mathematical problems. The pa- ralysis that occurs during REM sleep is caused by an almost total loss of skeletal muscle tone or atonia . Most of the body is actually incapable of moving! Respiratory muscles do continue to function but just barely. The muscles controlling eye movement and the tiny muscles of the inner ear are the exceptions; these are strikingly active. With lids closed, the eyes occasionally dart rapidly back and forth. These bursts of rapid eye move- ment are the best predictors of vivid dreaming, and at least 90% of people awakened during or after them report dreams. Physiological control systems are dominated by sympathetic activity during REM sleep. Inexplicably, the body’s temperature control system simply quits, and core temperature begins to drift downward. Heart and respiration rates increase but become irregular. In healthy people, the TABLE 19.1 Characteristics of the Three Functional States of the Brain Behavior Awake Non-REM Sleep REM Sleep EEG Low voltage, fast High voltage, slow Low voltage, fast Sensation Vivid, externally generated Dull or absent Vivid, internally generated Thought Logical, progressive Logical, repetitive Vivid, illogical, bizarre Movement Continuous, voluntary Occasional, involuntary Muscle paralysis; movement commanded by the brain but not carried out Rapid eye movement Often Rare Often \n660 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR clitoris and penis become engorged with blood and erect, although this usually has nothing to do with any sexual content of dreams. Overall, during REM sleep, the brain seems to be doing everything except resting. The Sleep Cycle Even a good night’s sleep is not a steady, unbroken journey. It normally begins with a period of non-REM sleep. Figure 19.15 shows that a typical full night of sleep includes a regular cycling of eye movements, physiologi- cal functions, and penile erections through non-REM and REM periods. It is obvious that sleep takes the brain through a repetitive roller coaster ride of activity, and sometimes the ride is pretty wild (Box 19.2). Roughly 75% of total sleep time is spent in non-REM and 25% in REM, with pe- riodic cycles between these states throughout the night. Non-REM sleep is generally divided into four distinct stages. During a normal night, we slide through the stages of non-REM, then into REM, then back through (b) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Time of day (h) 0 10 20 30 0 14 18 22 26 55 65 75 (a) Awake Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 4 EEG stages Heart rate Eye movements Respiration rate Penile erection Non- REM REM Non- REM REM Non- REM REM Non- REM REM Non- REM REM FIGURE 19.15 Physiological changes during non- REM and REM sleep. (a) This graph represents one night of sleep, starting with a transition from awake to stage 1 non-REM sleep. The sleep cycle pro- gresses through the deeper stages of non-REM sleep, then into REM sleep. It is repeated several times, but each cycle has shorter and shallower non-REM pe- riods and longer REM periods. (b) These graphs show regular increases in heart rate, respiration rate, and penile erection during the REM periods of one night sleep. (Source: Adapted from Purves et al., 2004, Fig. 27.7.) \n661 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP the non-REM stages again, repeating the cycle about every 90 minutes. These cycles are examples of ultradian rhythms , which have faster pe- riods than circadian rhythms. EEG rhythms during the stages of sleep are shown in Figure 19.16. An average, healthy adult becomes drowsy and begins to sleep, ﬁ rst enter- ing stage 1 non-REM sleep. Stage 1 is transitional sleep, when the EEG alpha rhythms of relaxed waking become less regular and wane, and the eyes make slow, rolling movements. Stage 1 is ﬂ eeting, usually lasting only a few minutes. It is also the lightest stage of sleep, meaning that we are most easily awakened. Stage 2 is slightly deeper and may last 5–15 minutes. Its characteristics include the occasional 8–14 Hz oscil- lation of the EEG called the sleep spindle , which is generated by a tha- lamic pacemaker (see Figure 19.12). In addition, a high-amplitude sharp wave called the K complex is sometimes observed. Eye movements almost cease. Next follows stage 3, and the EEG begins large-amplitude, slow delta rhythms. Eye and body movements are few. Stage 4 is the deepest stage of sleep, with large EEG rhythms of 2 Hz or less. During the ﬁ rst cycle of sleep, stage 4 may persist for 20–40 minutes. Then sleep begins to lighten again, ascends through stage 3 to stage 2 for 10–15 minutes, and suddenly enters a brief period of REM sleep, with its fast EEG beta and gamma rhythms and sharp, frequent eye movements. As the night progresses, there is a general reduction in the duration of non-REM sleep, particularly in stages 3 and 4, and an increase in the REM periods. Half of the night’s REM sleep occurs during its last third, and the longest REM periods may last 30–50 minutes. Still, there seems to be an obligatory refractory period of about 30 minutes between periods of REM; in other words, each REM period is followed by at least 30 min- utes of non-REM sleep before the next REM period can begin. O F  S P E C I A L  I N T E R E S T Walking, Talking, and Screaming in Your Sleep S leep is not always serene and stationary. Talking, walk- ing, and screaming are common, usually occurring during non-REM sleep. If this seems surprising, remember that REM sleep is accompanied by almost total body paralysis. You would therefore be incapable of walking or talking during REM sleep, even if your dream “urged” you to do it. Sleepwalking, or somnambulism , peaks at about age 11. Although 40% of us were sleepwalkers as children, few of us sleepwalk as adults. Sleepwalking usually occurs during the ﬁ rst stage 4 non-REM period of the night. A full-blown sleep- walking incident involves open eyes and movement around the room, the house, or even outside, with enough awareness to avoid objects and climb stairs. Cognitive functioning and judgment are severely impaired. It is often difﬁ cult to awaken sleepwalkers because they are in deep, slow-wave sleep. The best treatment is a guiding hand back to bed. Sleepwalkers usually have no memory of the incident the next morning. Almost everyone practices sleep talking, somniloquy , now and then. Unfortunately, sleeping speech is often so garbled or nonsensical that a curious listener is disappointed by its emptiness. More dramatic are sleep terrors, also known a s night ter- rors, which are most common in children 5–7 years old. A girl screams in the middle of the night. Her parents rush to her bedside, frantic to know what has alarmed her. The girl cries inconsolably, unable to explain her horrifying experi- ence. After 10 agonizing minutes of shrieking and ﬂ ailing, she ﬁ nally sleeps quietly, leaving the parents shaken and bafﬂ ed. The next morning she is bright and cheerful, with no recollec- tion of the night’s misadventure. Sleep terrors are distinctly different from nightmares, which are vivid, complex dreams, outwardly quiet, that occur during REM sleep. By contrast, sleep terrors begin in stage 3 or 4 of non-REM sleep, and the experience is not dreamlike but a feeling of uncontrol- lable panic, accompanied by greatly increased heart rate and blood pressure. They usually pass with adolescence and are not a symptom of a psychiatric disorder. BOX 19.2 \n662 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR What is a normal night’s sleep? Your mother may have insisted that you need a “good 8 hours” of sleep each night. Research suggests that normal requirements vary widely among adults, from about 5–10 hours per night. The average length is about 7.5 hours, and the sleep duration of about 68% of young adults is between 6.5 and 8.5 hours. Teenagers may ﬁ nd it especially challenging to get enough sleep. Research by Mary Carskadon at Brown University suggests that sleep requirements do not decrease between preadolescence and early teen years, but changes in circadian timing mechanisms make it progressively harder for teenagers to fall asleep early in the evening. This process often coincides with the move to high school and an earlier start of the school day. As a result, many students are chronically sleep-deprived, which is an unhealthy condition. Too little sleep can reduce cognitive, emotional, and physical well-being. What is the proper length of sleep time for you? The best measure of successful sleep is the quality of your time awake. You need a certain amount of sleep in order to maintain a reasonable level of alertness. Too much daytime sleepiness can be more than annoying; it can be danger- ous if it interferes with driving, for example. Because of the wide varia- tions among individuals, you must decide for yourself how much sleep you need. Why Do We Sleep? All mammals, birds, and reptiles appear to sleep, although only mam- mals and some birds have a REM phase. Sleep time varies widely, from about 18 hours a day in bats and opossums to about 3 hours a day in horses and giraffes. Many people argue that a behavior as pervasive as sleep must have a critical function; otherwise, some species would have Awake Alpha rhythms Theta rhythms Delta rhythms Delta rhythms Spindle K complex Beta and gamma rhythms Beta and gamma rhythms REM sleep Stage 4 non-REM sleep Stage 1 non-REM sleep Stage 2 non-REM sleep Stage 3 non-REM sleep 5 Time (sec) 10 15 20 0 ▲ FIGURE 19.16 EEG rhythms during the stages of sleep. (Source: Adapted from Horne, 1988, Fig. 1.1) \n663 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP lost the need to sleep through evolution. Whatever the function, there is good reason to believe sleep is mainly for the brain. Cognitive impairment is the most immediate and obvious consequence of sleep deprivation. A restful 8 hours in bed without sleep might allow your body to recover from physical exertion, but you would not be at your best mentally the next day. Some animals apparently have more reason not to sleep than others. Imagine living your entire life in deep or turbulent water, yet needing to breathe air every minute or so. Even a quick nap would be awkward, at best. This is precisely the situation with dolphins and whales, yet they sleep about as much as humans do. Remarkably, bottlenose dolphins sleep with only one cerebral hemisphere at a time: about 2 hours of non- REM sleep on just one side, then 1 hour awake on both sides, 2 hours of non-REM sleep on the other side, and so on, for a total of about 12 hours per night (Figure 19.17). (This gives new meaning to the phrase “being half asleep.”) There is no evidence that dolphins or whales have REM sleep. Another unusual sleep strategy is used by the blind Indus River dolphin of Pakistan. This dolphin uses sonar to navigate through muddy, turbid, sweeping currents, and during monsoon season it must never stop swimming or it will come to grief on the rocks and debris of the ﬂ ooded es- tuary it calls home. Still, the Indus River dolphin seems to sleep, snatch- ing “microsleeps” 4–6 seconds long while continuing to swim slowly. Its many microsleeps add up to about 7 hours in a 24-hour day. Dolphins have evolved extraordinary sleep mechanisms that adapt them to a demanding environment. But the fact that dolphins are not sleepless reinforces our question: What is so important about sleeping? No single theory of the function of sleep is widely accepted, but the most reasonable ideas fall into two categories: theories of restoration and theories of adaptation . The ﬁ rst category is a commonsense explanation: We sleep in order to rest and recover and to prepare to be awake again. The second category is less obvious: We sleep to keep us out of trouble, to hide from predators when we are most vulnerable or from other harmful features of the environment, or to conserve energy. If sleep is restorative, what is it restoring? Quiet rest is certainly not a substitute for sleep. Sleeping does something more than simple resting. Prolonged sleep deprivation can lead to serious physical and behavioral problems (Box 19.3). Unfortunately, no one has yet identiﬁ ed a particular 5 sec Left Right (a) (b) (c) ▲ FIGURE 19.17 Sleep in the bottlenose dolphin.

(Source: Lyamin et al., 2008, Fig. 1.) \n664 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR physiological process that is clearly restored by sleep or an essential sub- stance that is made or a toxin that is destroyed while sleeping. Sleep does prepare us to be effectively awake again. But does sleep renew us in the same way that eating and drinking do, by replacing essential substances, or the way the healing of a wound repairs damaged tissues? For the most part, evidence indicates that sleep is not a time of increased tissue re- pair for the body. However, it is possible that brain regions such as the cerebral cortex can achieve some form of essential “rest” only during non- REM sleep. Adaptation theories of sleep take many forms. Some large animals eat small animals; a stroll in the moonlight is far too risky for a squirrel liv- ing in owl and fox territory. The squirrel’s best strategy may be to stay safely tucked away in an underground burrow during the night, and sleep is a good way to enforce such isolation. At the same time, sleep may be an adaptation for conserving energy. While sleeping, the body does only just enough work to stay alive, core temperature drops, temperature regula- tion is depressed, and the rate of calories burned is kept low. Functions of Dreaming and REM Sleep In many ancient cultures, people believed that dreams were a window on some higher world and a source of information, guidance, power, or enlightenment. Perhaps they were right, but the collective wisdom of the past does not agree on exactly how to interpret the meaning of dreams. Today we must take a step backward and ﬁ rst ask whether dreams even have meaning. Dreams are difﬁ cult to study. Obviously, we can’t directly observe the dreams of someone else, and even the dreamer has access to them only after he or she has awakened and perhaps forgotten or dis- torted the experience. Modern explanations of dreaming lean heavily on O F  S P E C I A L  I N T E R E S T The Longest All-Nighter I n 1963, Randy Gardner was a 17-year-old high school student with an ambitious idea for a San Diego Science Fair project. On December 28 he awoke at 6 a.m. to begin. When he ﬁ nished 11 days (264 hours) later, he had broken the world’s record for nonstop wakefulness, under the con- tinuous scrutiny of two friends and, during the last 5 days, fascinated sleep researchers. He had used no drugs, not even caffeine. The experience was not pleasant. After 2 days without sleep, Randy became irritable and nauseated, had trouble remembering, and could not even watch television. By the fourth day, he had mild delusions and overwhelming fatigue, and by the seventh day, he had tremors, his speech was slurred, and his EEG no longer showed alpha rhythms. At times he was paranoid or hallucinating. Fortunately, he did not become psychotic, despite the predictions of some experts. On the contrary, on his last awake night, he beat one of his better rested observers at an arcade baseball game, and he gave a coherent account of himself at a na- tional press conference. When he ﬁ nally went to bed, he slept for almost 15 hours straight, then stayed awake 23 hours to wait for nightfall, and slept for another 10.5 hours. After the ﬁ rst sleep, his symp- toms had mostly disappeared, and within a week, he was sleeping and behaving normally. One of the most interesting things about Randy’s ordeal is that there were no lasting harmful effects. The same is not true for some animals deprived of sleep. If rats are kept awake for long periods, they progressively lose weight while consum- ing much more food, become weak, accumulate stomach ulcers and internal hemorrhages, and even die. They seem to suffer from an impairment of their ability to regulate body temperature and metabolic needs. Total sleep deprivation is not necessary. Prolonged REM sleep loss alone is detrimen- tal. These results may imply that sleep provides something physiologically essential. BOX 19.3 \n665 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP studies of REM sleep rather than dreaming because the phenomena of REM can be objectively measured. But it is important to remember that the two are not synonymous. Some dreams can occur outside of REM sleep, and REM sleep has many peculiar features that have nothing to do with dreaming. Do we need to dream? No one knows, but the body does seem to crave REM sleep. It is possible to deprive sleepers of REM sleep speciﬁ cally by waking them every time they enter the REM state; when they fall asleep a minute or two later, it is inevitably into a non-REM state, and they can accumulate an entire night of relatively pure non-REM sleep. As Dement ﬁ rst observed, after several days of this annoying treatment, sleepers attempt to enter the REM state much more frequently than nor- mal. When they are ﬁ nally allowed to sleep undisturbed, they experience REM rebound and spend more time in REM proportional to the duration of their deprivation. Most studies have found that REM deprivation does not cause any major psychological harm during the daytime. Again, it is important not to interpret REM deprivation as dream deprivation, since during REM deprivation, dreams may continue to occur during sleep onset and during non-REM periods. Sigmund Freud suggested many functions for dreams. For Freud, dreams were disguised wish fulﬁ llment, an unconscious way for us to express our sexual and aggressive fantasies, which are forbidden while we are awake. Bad dreams might help us conquer the anxiety-provoking events of life. Recent theories of dreaming are more biologically based. Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley of Harvard University propose an “activation–synthesis hypothesis,” which explicitly rejects freudian, psy- chological interpretations. Instead, dreams, or at least some of their bi- zarre features, are seen as the associations and memories of the cere- bral cortex that are elicited by the random discharges of the pons during REM sleep. Thus, the pontine neurons, via the thalamus, activate various areas of the cerebral cortex, elicit well-known images or emotions, and the cortex then tries to synthesize the disparate images into a sensible whole. Not surprisingly, the “synthesized” dream product may be quite bizarre and even nonsensical because it is triggered by the semirandom activity of the pons. Evidence for the activation–synthesis hypothesis is mixed. It does predict the weirdness of dreams and their correlation with REM sleep. But it does not explain how random activity can trigger the complex and ﬂ uid stories that many dreams contain nor how it can evoke dreams that recur night after night. Many researchers have suggested that REM sleep, and perhaps dreams themselves, have an important role in memory. None of the evidence is deﬁ nitive, but intriguing hints indicate that REM sleep somehow aids the integration or consolidation of memories. Depriving humans or rats of REM sleep can impair their ability to learn a variety of tasks. Some studies show an increase in the duration of REM sleep after an intense learning experience. In one study, Israeli neuroscientist Avi Karni and his colleagues trained people to identify the orientation of a small line in their peripheral visual ﬁ eld. The task was made difﬁ cult by presenting the visual stimulus for a very short period of time. With repeated practice over days, people got much better at this task; surprisingly, their perfor- mance also improved between evening and morning, after a night’s sleep. Karni found that if people were deprived of REM sleep, their learning of the task did not improve overnight. Depriving them of non-REM sleep, on the other hand, actually enhanced their performance. Karni hypothesizes that this kind of memory requires a period of time to strengthen and that REM sleep is particularly effective for this purpose. \n666 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR You may have heard about sleep learning, the notion that you can study for an exam by simply listening to a tape of the material while you bliss- fully snooze away. Sounds like a student’s fantasy, right? Unfortunately, it is exactly that and no more. There is no scientiﬁ c evidence for sleep learning, and careful studies have shown that the very few things re- called the next morning were heard when the subjects brieﬂ y woke up. In fact, sleep is a profoundly amnesic state. Most of our dreams, for example, seem to be lost forever. Although we dream profusely during each of the four or ﬁ ve REM periods every night, we usually remember only the last dream before waking. Also, when we brieﬂ y wake up to do something in the middle of the night, we have often forgotten the incident by morning. At this point you are probably confused about the functions of dream- ing and REM sleep. So are we. Unfortunately, there is not enough evi- dence to support or dismiss any of the theories we have discussed. There are also many other creative and plausible ideas that we do not have the space to present here. Neural Mechanisms of Sleep Until the 1940s, it was generally believed that sleep was a passive pro- cess: Deprive the brain of sensory input, and it will fall asleep. However, when the sensory afferents to an animal’s brain are blocked, the animal continues to have cycles of waking and sleeping. We now know that sleep is an active process that requires the participation of a variety of brain regions. As we saw in Chapter 15, wide expanses of the cortex are actu- ally controlled by very small collections of neurons much deeper in the brain. These cells act like the switches or tuners of the forebrain, altering cortical excitability and gating the ﬂ ow of sensory information into it. The full details of these control systems are complex and not fully understood. But we can summarize a few basic principles: 1. The neurons most critical to the control of sleeping and waking are part of the diffuse modulatory neurotransmitter systems (see Chapter 15, Figures 15.12 to 15.15). 2. The brain stem modulatory neurons using norepinephrine and sero- tonin ﬁ re during waking and enhance the awake state; some neurons using acetylcholine enhance critical REM events, and other cholinergic neurons are active during waking. 3. The diffuse modulatory systems control the rhythmic behaviors of the thalamus, which in turn controls many EEG rhythms of the cerebral cortex; slow, sleep-related rhythms of the thalamus apparently block the ﬂ ow of sensory information up to the cortex. 4. Sleep also involves activity in descending branches of the diffuse modulatory systems, such as the inhibition of motor neurons during dreaming. There are three basic kinds of evidence for the localization of sleep mechanisms in the brain. Lesion data reveal changes in function after a part of the brain is removed, results of stimulation experiments identify changes following the activation of a brain region, and recordings of neu- ral activity determine the relationship between that activity and differ- ent brain states. Wakefulness and the Ascending Reticular Activating System. Lesions in the brain stem of humans can cause sleep and coma, suggesting that the brain stem has neurons whose activity is essential to keeping us awake. Italian neurophysiologist Giuseppe Moruzzi and his colleagues,  working \n667 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP in the 1940s and 1950s, began to sort out the neurobiology of the brain stem’s control of waking and arousal. They found that lesions in the mid- line structures of the brain stem caused a state similar to non-REM sleep, but lesions in the lateral tegmentum, which interrupted ascending sen- sory inputs, did not. Conversely, electrical stimulation of the midline teg- mentum of the midbrain, within the reticular formation, transformed the cortex from the slow, rhythmic EEGs of non-REM sleep to a more alert and aroused state with an EEG similar to that of waking. Moruzzi called this ill-deﬁ ned region of stimulation the ascending reticular activating system (mentioned in Chapter 15). This area is now much better deﬁ ned, anatomically and physiologically, and it is clear that Moruzzi’s stimula- tion was affecting many different sets of ascending modulatory systems. Several sets of neurons increase their ﬁ ring rates in anticipation of awakening and during various forms of arousal. They include cells of the locus coeruleus, which contain norepinephrine, serotonin-containing cells of the raphe nuclei, acetylcholine-containing cells of the brain stem and basal forebrain, midbrain neurons that use histamine as a neurotrans- mitter, and neurons of the hypothalamus that use hypocretin (orexin) as a transmitter (Figure 19.18). Collectively, these neurons synapse directly on the entire thalamus, cerebral cortex, and many other brain regions. The general effects of their transmitters are a depolarization of neurons, an increase in their excitability, and a suppression of rhythmic forms of ﬁ ring. These effects are most clearly seen in the relay neurons of the thalamus (Figure 19.19). Hypocretin (also known as orexin ; see Chapter 16) is a small peptide neurotransmitter expressed mainly by neurons whose cell bodies are in the lateral hypothalamus. The axons of hypocretin (orexin)-secreting neurons project widely in the brain, and they strongly excite cells of the cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, and histaminergic modulatory systems. When the peptide was ﬁ rst discovered, researchers thought hypocretin (orexin) was involved speciﬁ cally in feeding behavior (see Chapter 16), but it clearly has a more general role. The peptide also promotes wakefulness, inhibits REM sleep, facilitates neurons that en- hance certain kinds of motor behavior, and is involved in the regulation of neuroendocrine and autonomic systems. The loss of hypocretin (orexin) neurons leads to a sleep disorder called narcolepsy (Box 19.4).

(a) Thalamic neurons at rest have a tendency to generate slow, delta frequency rhythms of intrinsic burst- firing (left). Under the influence of several neuromodulators such as ACh, NE, and histamine, neurons depolarize and switch to a more excitable single-spiking mode (right). This may resemble what happens during transitions from non-REM sleep to the waking state. Expanded views of rhythmic bursting (b) and single-spiking (c) are also shown. (Source: Adapted from McCormick and Pape, 1990, Fig. 14.) Falling Asleep and the Non-REM State. Falling asleep involves a pro- gression of changes over several minutes, culminating in the non-REM state. It is not entirely clear what initiates non-REM sleep, although cer- tain sleep-promoting factors contribute (as we will describe later), and there is a general decrease in the ﬁ ring rates of most brain stem modula- tory neurons (those using NE, 5-HT, and ACh). Although most regions of the basal forebrain seem to promote alertness and arousal, a subset of its cholinergic neurons increases their ﬁ ring rate with the onset of non-REM sleep and are silent during wakefulness. Early stages of non-REM sleep include the EEG sleep spindles, des- cribed earlier, which are generated in part by the inherent rhythmicity of thalamic neurons (see Figure 19.11). As non-REM sleep progresses, spindles disappear and are replaced by slow delta rhythms (less than 4 Hz). Delta rhythms may also be a product of thalamic cells, occurring when their membrane potentials become even more negative than dur- ing spindle rhythms (and much more negative than during waking). Synchronization of activity during spindle or delta rhythms is due to neu- ral interconnections within the thalamus and between the thalamus and cortex. Because of the strong, two-way excitatory connections between the thalamus and cortex, rhythmic activity in one is often strongly and widely projected upon the other. \n669 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP Narcolepsy N arcolepsy is a bizarre and disabling disturbance of sleep- ing and waking. Despite the sound of the name, it is not a form of epilepsy. It can include some or all of the following manifestations. Excessive daytime sleepiness can be severe and often leads to unwanted “sleep attacks.” Cataplexy is a sudden muscular paralysis while consciousness is maintained. In the middle of a normal day, sufferers suddenly collapse into a state similar to REM sleep. Cataplexy is often brought on by strong emotional expression, such as laughter or tears, or by surprise or sexual arousal, and it usually lasts less than a minute. Sleep paralysis , a similar loss of muscle control, occurs during the transition between sleeping and waking. Sometimes occurring in the absence of narcolepsy, it can be very disconcerting; even though conscious, a person may be unable to move or speak for several minutes. Hypnagogic hallucinations are graphic dreams, often frightening, that can accompany sleep onset and may occur following sleep paralysis. Sometimes such dreams ﬂ ow smoothly with real events that occurred just prior to falling asleep. EEG monitoring reveals a distinct difference between nar- coleptic and normal sleep. A narcoleptic person goes directly from waking into a REM phase, whereas normal adult sleep- ers always enter a long period of non-REM sleep ﬁ rst. Most narcolepsy symptoms might be interpreted as an abnormal intrusion of the characteristics of REM sleep into waking. The prevalence of narcolepsy varies widely, affecting about 1 in 1000–2000 people in the U.S. population but only 1 in 500,000 in Israel, for example. The typical age of onset is 12–16 years. The disorder has a genetic component, and a high percentage of narcoleptics have a particular form of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene. However, about 25% of the general population has the narcoleptic form of the HLA gene, yet the large majority do not develop narco- lepsy. Environmental factors may also play an important role. A recent study in China found that the onset of narcolepsy in children varies with the seasons and tends to be highest fol- lowing winter-related respiratory infections. There was a par- ticularly sharp rise in cases of narcolepsy just after the H1N1 inﬂ uenza pandemic in 2009–2010, followed by a decrease in the two years following. Narcolepsy rates increased both in Europe, where many people were vaccinated against H1N1, and in China, where vaccines were not available. Narcolepsy occurs in goats, donkeys, ponies, and more than a dozen breeds of dogs. In 1999, Emmanuel Mignot, Seiji Nishino, and their research team at Stanford University found that canine narcolepsy is caused by a mutation of the gene for a hypocretin receptor. Also in 1999, Masashi Yanagisawa and his group at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center deleted the genes responsible for the pep- tide neurotransmitter hypocretin in mice and found that the animals were narcoleptic. Basic animal research of this sort quickly inspired important studies of human narcolepsy. In 2000, two research teams discovered that the brains of human narcoleptics have about 10% or less of the nor- mal complement of hypocretin-containing neurons (Figure A). Their CSF has immeasurably low levels of hypocretin, whereas hypocretin is found at normal levels in nearly every other neurological disease. Human narcolepsy almost certainly results from the selective death of hypocretin-containing neurons in most cases. Unlike in some animal versions of the disease, hypocretin deﬁ ciency is rarely caused by mutations of the hypocretin or hypocretin receptor genes. The reason hypocretin neurons die in narcoleptic patients is unknown, although there is strong evidence that some kind of autoim- mune process is involved. Fragments of viral proteins may mimic hypocretin, somehow priming immune cells to attack hypocretin-releasing cells. There is no cure for narcolepsy yet, and current treat- ments aim only to relieve the symptoms. Frequent naps, am- phetamines, and a drug called modaﬁ nil may help daytime sleepiness, while tricyclic antidepressant drugs (which have REM-suppressant effects) may reduce cataplexy and sleep paralysis. The discovery that hypocretin deﬁ ciency underlies narcolepsy suggests an obvious potential treatment; adminis- ter hypocretin or its agonists. Results from human trials have so far been disappointing. One problem is that hypocretin does not penetrate the blood–brain barrier very well. Transplantation of hypocretin neurons has shown some promise in animal studies, but no human trials have been attempted.

REM is such a different state from non-REM that we would expect some clear neural distinctions. Many cortical areas are at least as active during REM sleep as they are during waking. For example, neurons of the motor cortex ﬁ re rapidly and generate organized motor patterns that attempt to command the entire body but succeed only with a few muscles of the eye and inner ear and those essential for respi- ration. The elaborate dreams of REM sleep certainly require the cerebral cortex. However, the cortex is not necessary for the production of REM sleep. The use of PET and fMRI imaging in the waking and sleeping human brain has provided fascinating glimpses of the activity patterns that dis- tinguish waking from REM and non-REM sleep. Figure 19.20a shows the difference in brain activity between REM sleep and waking. Some areas, including primary visual cortex, were about equally active in the two states. However, extrastriate cortical areas and portions of the limbic system were signiﬁ cantly more active during REM sleep than waking. Conversely, regions of the frontal lobes were noticeably less active during REM. Figure 19.20b contrasts the brain activity in REM and non-REM sleep. The primary visual cortex and a number of other areas are signiﬁ - cantly less active during REM sleep, but extrastriate cortex is more active than it is in non-REM. These results paint an intriguing picture of what happens when we sleep. During REM, there is an explosion of extrastriate activity, presumably during the times when we dream. However, there is no corresponding activity increase in the primary visual cortex, suggest- ing that the extrastriate excitation is internally generated. The emotional component of dreams might derive from the heightened limbic activation. The low activity in the frontal lobe suggests that high-level integration or interpretation of the extrastriate visual information might not take place, leaving us with a buzz of uninterpreted visual imagery. The control of REM sleep, as with the other functional brain states, derives from diffuse modulatory systems in the core of the brain stem, particularly the pons.

(a) Colors represent differences in activity between REM sleep and waking; green, yellow, and red indicate higher activation during REM, and purples indicate lower activation during REM.

In REM, striate cortex is less active. (Source: Braun et al., 1998, Fig. 1.) \n671 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP upper brain stem, the locus coeruleus and the raphe nuclei, decrease to almost nothing before the onset of REM (Figure 19.21). However, there is a concurrent sharp increase in the ﬁ ring rates of ACh-containing neu- rons in the pons, and some evidence suggests that cholinergic neurons induce REM sleep. It is probably the action of ACh during REM sleep that causes the thalamus and cortex to behave so much like they do in the waking state. Why don’t we act out our dreams? The same core brain stem systems that control the sleep processes of the forebrain also actively inhibit our spinal motor neurons, preventing the descending motor activity from ex- pressing itself as actual movement. This is clearly an adaptive mecha- nism, protecting us from ourselves. In rare cases, usually elderly men, dreamers seem to act out their dreams; they have a hazardous condition known as REM sleep behavior disorder . These people often sustain re- peated injuries, and even their spouses have fallen victim to their noc- turnal ﬂ ailings. One man dreamed he was in a football game and tackled his bedroom bureau. Another imagined he was defending his wife from attack, when in fact he was beating her in her bed. The basis for this REM disorder seems to be disruption of the brain stem systems that normally mediate REM atonia. Experimental lesions in certain parts of the pons can cause a similar condition in cats. During REM periods, they may seem to chase imaginary mice or investigate invisible intruders. Disorders of REM control mechanisms, caused by a deﬁ ciency of hypocretin (orexin), also contribute to the problems of people with narcolepsy (see Box 19.4). Sleep-Promoting Factors. Sleep researchers have searched intensively for chemicals in the blood or cerebrospinal ﬂ uid (CSF) that promote or even cause sleep. Many sleep-promoting substances have been identiﬁ ed in sleep-deprived animals. We will describe some of the major ones here. One key sleep substance is adenosine. Adenosine is used by all cells to build some of the most basic molecules of life, including DNA, RNA, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Adenosine is also released by some neu- rons and glia and acts as a neuromodulator at synapses throughout the brain. It’s a substance that might appeal to the millions who drink cof- fee, tea, and cola. From ancient times, antagonists of adenosine receptors, such as caffeine and theophylline, have been used to keep people awake. Conversely, the administration of adenosine or its agonists increases sleep. Extracellular levels of natural brain adenosine are higher during waking than while sleeping. Levels progressively increase during prolonged wak- ing periods and sleep deprivation, and they gradually decrease during sleep. Waking-related changes in adenosine levels occur not in the entire brain, but only in certain sleep-related regions. These two properties of adenosine—its sleep-promoting effect and the levels that track the need for sleep—strongly suggest it is an important sleep-promoting factor. 1 Firing rate 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Hours since sleep onset Non-REM REM REM-on cells REM-off cells 0 FIGURE 19.21 Control of the onset and offset of REM periods by brain stem neurons. This graph shows the relative firing rates of REM-associated neurons during a single night. Periods of REM sleep are green. REM-on cells are cholinergic neurons of the pons, and they increase their firing rates just before the onset of REM sleep (red line). REM-off cells are noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons of the locus coeruleus and raphe nuclei, respectively, and their firing rates increase just before the end of REM sleep (blue line). (Source: McCarley and Massaquoi, 1986, Fig. 4B.) \n672 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR How might adenosine promote sleep? Adenosine has an inhibitory  effect on the diffuse modulatory systems for ACh, NE, and 5-HT that tend to pro- mote wakefulness. This suggests that sleep may be the result of a molecu- lar chain reaction. Neural activity in the awake brain increases  adenosine levels, thereby increasing the inhibition of neurons in the modulatory sys- tems associated with wakefulness. Enhanced suppression of the  “wakeful” modulatory systems makes it more likely that the brain will fall into the slow-wave synchronous activity characteristic of non-REM sleep. After sleep begins, adenosine levels slowly fall, and activity in the modulatory systems gradually increases until we wake up to start the cycle anew. Another important sleep-promoting factor is nitric oxide (NO) . Recall that NO is a small, mobile, gaseous molecule that can diffuse easily across membranes and serves as a retrograde (postsynaptic to presynaptic) mes- senger between certain neurons (see Chapter 6). The wake-promoting cholinergic neurons of the brain stem express particularly high levels of the synthesizing enzyme for NO. Brain NO levels are highest during wak- ing, and they rise rapidly with sleep deprivation. How does NO promote sleep? Studies have shown that NO triggers the release of adenosine. As we have seen, adenosine promotes non-REM sleep by suppressing the activity of neurons that help to sustain waking. Sleepiness is one of the most familiar consequences of infectious dis- eases, such as the common cold and the ﬂ u. There are direct links be- tween the immune response to infection and the regulation of sleep. In the 1970s, physiologist John Pappenheimer of Harvard University identiﬁ ed a muramyl dipeptide in the spinal ﬂ uid of sleep-deprived goats that facilitated non-REM sleep. Muramyl peptides are usually produced only by the cell walls of bacteria, not brain cells, and they also cause fever and stimulate immune cells of the blood. It is not clear how they appear in CSF, but they may be synthesized by bacteria in the intestines. More recent research has implicated several cytokines , small signaling peptides involved in the immune system, in the regulation of sleep. One of them is interleukin-1 , which is synthesized in the brain by glia, and by macrophages, cells throughout the body that scavenge foreign material. Like adenosine and NO, interleukin-1 levels increase during waking, and in humans its levels peak just before the onset of sleep. Interleukin-1 promotes non-REM sleep even when the immune system has not been challenged. When given to humans, it induces fatigue and sleepiness. Interleukin-1 also stimulates the immune system. Another endogenous sleep-promoting substance is melatonin , a hor- mone secreted by the pea-sized pineal body (see the appendix to Chapter 7). Melatonin is a derivative of the amino acid tryptophan. It has been called the “Dracula of hormones” because it is released only when the environ- ment darkens—normally at night—and its release is inhibited by light. In humans, melatonin levels tend to rise around the time we become sleepy in the evening, peak in the early morning hours, and then fall to baseline levels by the time we awaken. Evidence suggests that melatonin helps initiate and maintain sleep, but its precise role in natural sleep–wake cycles is not clear. In recent years, melatonin has become popular as an over-the-counter sleep-promoting drug. Although it has shown some promise in treating the symptoms of jet lag and the insomnia that affects some older adults, the general effect of melatonin on improving sleep re- mains debatable. Gene Expression during Sleeping and Waking. Research into the neural function of sleep has beneﬁ ted from studies at various levels of analy- sis, including sleep behavior, brain physiology, and the action of diffuse \n673 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP modulatory systems. Methods from molecular neurobiology have also con- tributed interesting facts. While the pieces do not all ﬁ t together quite yet, it is clear that the behavioral states of sleeping and waking are different even at the molecular level. For example, in the macaque monkey, most areas of cerebral cortex show higher rates of protein synthesis in deep sleep than in light sleep. In rats, levels of cAMP in several brain areas have been found to be lower during sleeping than waking. Research has demonstrated that sleeping and waking are associated with differences in the expression of certain genes. Chiara Cirelli and Giulio Tononi, working at the Neurosciences Institute in San Diego and at the University of Wisconsin, have studied the expression of thousands of genes in rats that were awake or asleep. The vast majority of genes were expressed at the same level in the two states. However, the 0.5% of genes that showed different levels of expression may provide insight into what happens in the brain during sleep. Most of the genes that were more highly expressed in the awake brain could be placed into one of three groups. One group in- cludes what are called immediate early genes , genes that code for transcrip- tion factors that affect the expression of other genes. Some of these genes appear to be related to changes in synaptic strength. The low expression of these genes during sleep may be associated with the fact that learning and memory formation are largely absent in this state. The second group of genes comes from  mitochondria. Increased expression of these genes may play a role in satisfying the higher metabolic demands of the awake brain. The third group includes genes related to responses to cellular stress. A different group of genes was most highly expressed during sleep, and some of them might contribute to increased protein synthesis and syn- aptic plasticity mechanisms that complement those most prevalent dur- ing waking. An important point is that the sleep-related changes in gene expression were speciﬁ c to the brain, and they did not change in other tissues, such as the liver and skeletal muscle. This is consistent with the widely held hypothesis that sleep is a process generated by the brain for the beneﬁ t of the brain. CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS Almost all land animals coordinate their behavior according to circadian rhythms , the daily cycles of daylight and darkness that result from the spin of the Earth. (The term is from the Latin circa , “approximately,” and dies , “day.”) The precise schedules of circadian rhythms vary among species. Some animals are active during daylight hours, others only at night, and others mainly at the transitional periods of dawn and dusk. Most physiological and biochemical processes in the body also rise and fall with daily rhythms; body temperature, blood ﬂ ow, urine production, hor- mone levels, hair growth, and metabolic rate all ﬂ uctuate (Figure 19.22). In humans, there is an approximately inverse relationship between the propensity to sleep and body temperature. When the cycles of daylight and darkness are removed from an ani- mal’s environment, circadian rhythms continue on more or less the same schedule because the primary clocks for circadian rhythms are not astro- nomical (the sun and Earth) but biological in the brain. Brain clocks, like all clocks, are imperfect and require occasional resetting. Now and then you readjust your watch to keep it in sync with the rest of the world (or at least the time on your computer). Similarly, external stimuli, such as light and dark, or daily temperature changes, help adjust the brain’s clocks to keep them synchronized with the coming and going of the  sunlight. C IR C A D I A N R HY T H M S \n674 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR Circadian rhythms have been well studied at behavioral, cellular, and molecular levels. Brain clocks are an interesting example of the link be- tween the activity of speciﬁ c neurons and behavior. Biological Clocks The ﬁ rst evidence for a biological clock came from a brainless organism, the mimosa plant. The mimosa raises its leaves during the day and lowers 1 Potassium (mEq/h) Cortisol ( μ g/100 mL) Growth hormone (ng/mL) Temperature (°C) Alertness Sleep Awake Sleep Awake Sleep 2 3 0 0 5 0 5 10 15 10 15 36 37 38 40 80 6 12 18 24 6 12 18 24 Time of day (h) ▲ FIGURE 19.22 Circadian rhythms of physiological functions. Fluctuations over two consecutive days are shown here. Alertness and core body temperature vary similarly, but growth hormone and cortisol levels in the blood are highest during sleep, although at differ- ent times. The bottom graph shows the excretion of potassium by the kidneys, which is highest during the day. (Source: Adapted from Coleman, 1986, Fig. 2.1.) \n675 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP them at night. It seemed obvious to many people that the plant simply reacted to sunlight with some kind of reﬂ ex movement. In 1729, French physicist Jean Jacques d’Ortous de Mairan tested the obvious; he put some mimosa plants in a dark closet and found that they continued to raise and lower their leaves. But a surprising new observation can still lead to a wrong conclusion. It was de Mairan’s opinion that the plant was still somehow sensing the sun’s movement, even in the darkness. More than a century later, Swiss botanist Augustin de Candolle showed that a similar plant in the dark moved its leaves up and down every 22 hours, rather than every 24 hours, according to the sun’s movement. This im- plied that the plant was not responding to the sun and very likely had an internal biological clock. Environmental time cues (light/dark, temperature and humidity vari- ations) are collectively termed zeitgebers (German for “time givers”). In the presence of zeitgebers, animals become entrained to the day–night rhythm and maintain an activity cycle of exactly 24 hours. Obviously, even small, consistent errors of timing could not be tolerated for long. A 24.5-hour cycle would, within 3 weeks, completely shift an animal from daytime to nighttime activity. When mammals are completely deprived of zeitgebers, they settle into a rhythm of activity and rest that often has a period more or less than 24 hours, in which case their rhythms are said to free-run . In mice, the natural free-running period is about 23 hours, in hamsters it is close to 24 hours, and in humans it tends to be 24.5–25.5 hours (Figure 19.23). It is quite difﬁ cult to separate a human from all possible zeitgebers. Even inside a laboratory, society provides many subtle time cues, such as the sounds of machinery, the comings and goings of people, and the on–off cycling of heating and air conditioning. Some of the most secluded envi- ronments are deep caves, which have been the sites for several  isolation FIGURE 19.23 Circadian rhythms of sleep and wakefulness. This is a plot of one person’s daily sleep-wake cycles over a period of 45 days. Each horizontal line is a day; solid lines indicate sleep, and dashed lines indicate waking. A triangle indicates the point of the day’s lowest body temperature. The subject was first ex- posed to 9 days of natural 24-hour cycles of light and dark, noise and quiet, and air temperature. During the middle 25 days, all time cues were removed, and the subject was free to set his own schedule. Notice that the sleep–wake cycles remained sta- ble, but each lengthened to about 25 hours. The subject was now free-running. Notice also that the low point of body temper- ature shifted from the end of the sleep period to the beginning. During the last 11 days, a  24-hour cycle of light and meals was reintroduced, the subject again entrained to a day-long rhythm, and body temperature gradually shifted back to its normal point in the sleep cycle.

When people in caves are allowed to set their own schedules of ac- tivity for months on end—waking and sleeping, turning lights on and off, and eating when they choose—they initially settle into roughly a  25-hour rhythm. But after days to weeks, their activity may begin to free-run with a surprisingly long period of 30–36 hours. They may stay awake for about 20 hours straight, then sleep for about 12 hours, and this pattern seems perfectly normal to them at the time. In isolation experiments, behavior and physiology do not always con- tinue to cycle together. Recent studies have found that body temperature and other physiological measures may continue to change reliably over a 24-hour cycle, even if people are entrained on a 20-hour or 28-hour “day” with artiﬁ cial lighting. This means that the rhythms of  temperature and sleeping–waking, which are normally synchronized to a 24-hour period, become desynchronized. In the cave experiments described earlier, there can be even larger differences in the periods of behavioral and physiologi- cal cycles, when people are allowed to set their own schedules. Normally, our lowest body temperature occurs shortly before we awaken in the morning, but when desynchronized, this temperature nadir can drift, ﬁ rst moving earlier into the sleep period, and then into waking time. Sleep quality and waking comfort are impaired when cycles are  desynchronized. One implication of this desynchronization is that the body has more than one biological clock because sleeping–waking and  temperature can cycle at their own pace, uncoupled from one another. Desynchronization may occur temporarily when we travel and force our bodies suddenly into a new sleep–wake cycle. This is the familiar experience known as jet lag , and the best cure is bright light, which helps resynchronize our biological clocks. The primary zeitgeber for mature mammals is the light–dark cycle. A mother’s hormone levels may be the ﬁ rst zeitgeber for some mammals, however, already entraining their activity levels in the womb. In stud- ies of various adult animals, effective zeitgebers have also included the periodic availability of food or water, social contact, environmental tem- perature cycles, and noise–quiet cycles. Although many of these are much less effective than light–dark cycles, they may be important for particular species, in certain circumstances. The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus: A Brain Clock A biological clock that produces circadian rhythms consists of several components: Light sensor → Clock → Output pathway One or more input pathways are sensitive to light and dark and entrain the clock and keep its rhythm coordinated with the circadian rhythms of the environment. The clock itself continues to run and keep its basic rhythm even when the input pathway is removed. Output pathways from the clock allow it to control certain brain and body functions according to the timing of the clock. Mammals have a tiny pair of neuron clusters in the hypothalamus that serves as a biological clock: the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) , intro- duced in Chapter 15. Each SCN has a volume of less than 0.3 mm 3 , and its neurons are among the smallest in the brain. They are located on either side of the midline, bordering the third ventricle (Figure 19.24). When the SCN is stimulated electrically, circadian rhythms can be shifted in a  predictable way. Removal of both nuclei abolishes the circadian rhythmicity of physical activity, sleeping and waking, and feeding and Pituitary Optic chiasm SCN Third ventricle SCN Optic chiasm Hypothalamus ▲ FIGURE 19.24 The human suprachiasmatic nuclei. Two SCN reside within the hypothala- mus, just above the optic chiasm and next to the third ventricle. The sagittal view is followed by a frontal view, sec- tioned at the dashed line. \n677 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP drinking (Figure 19.25). In hamsters, the transplantation of a new SCN can restore rhythms within 2–4 weeks (Box 19.5). The brain’s internal rhythms never return without an SCN. Lesions in the SCN do not abolish sleeping, however, and animals will continue to coordinate their sleeping and waking with light–dark cycles if they are present. Sleep  appears to be regulated by a mechanism other than the circadian clock, which depends primarily on the amount and timing of prior sleep. Because behavior is normally synchronized with light–dark cycles, there must also be a photosensitive mechanism for resetting the brain clock. The SCN accomplishes this via the retinohypothalamic tract: Axons from ganglion cells in the retina synapse directly on the dendrites of SCN neurons. This input from the retina is necessary and sufﬁ cient to entrain (a) (b) 36.0 8 20 8 20 8 20 8 20 8 20 8 20 8 8 Time of day (h) 20 8 20 8 20 8 20 8 20 8 20 8 Time of day (h) 38.0 40.0 REM Non-REM2 Non-REM1 Awake State 36.0 38.0 40.0 REM Non-REM2 Non-REM1 Awake State Temperature (˚C) Temperature (˚C) ▲ FIGURE 19.25 The SCN and circadian rhythms.

(Source: Adapted from Edgar et al., 1993, Figs. 1, 3.) \n678 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR sleeping and waking cycles to night and day. When recordings are made from neurons of the SCN, many are indeed sensitive to light. Unlike the more familiar neurons of the visual pathways (see Chapter 10), SCN neurons have very large, nonselective receptive ﬁ elds and respond to the luminance of light stimuli rather than their orientation or motion. Research in the last decade suggests, surprisingly, that the retinal cells synchronizing the SCN are neither rods nor cones. It had long been known that eyeless mice cannot use light to reset their clocks, but  mutant mice with intact retinas that lack rods and cones can! Since rods and cones were the only known photoreceptors in mammals, it remained a mystery how light could affect the circadian clock without them. This mystery was solved by David Berson of Brown University and his colleagues. They discovered a new photoreceptor in the retina that was not at all like rods and cones but was, remarkably, a very  specialized type of ganglion cell. Recall from Chapter 9 that ganglion cells are retinal neurons whose axons send visual information to the rest of the brain; ganglion cells, like nearly all other neurons in the brain, were not sup- posed to be directly sensitive to light. The light-sensitive ganglion cells, however, express a unique type of photopigment called melanopsin , which is not present in rods and cones. These neurons are very slowly excited by light, and their axons send a signal directly to the SCN that can reset the circadian clock that resides there. Mutant Hamster Clocks G olden hamsters are perfectionists of circadian timing. When placed in constant darkness, they continue sleeping and waking, running on their wheels, and eating and drinking over an average period of 24.1 hours for weeks on end. It was this dependability that made neuroscientists Martin Ralph and Michael Menaker, then working at the University of Oregon, notice when one of the hamsters in their laboratory began punching in with 22.0-hour cycles during a period of 3 weeks in the dark. This maverick male was bred with three females of unimpeachable circadian character (their free- running periods were 24.01, 24.03, and 24.04 hours—quite normal). When 20 pups from the three resulting litters were tested in the dark, their free-running periods were evenly split into two narrow groups. Half had periods of 24.0 hours and half had periods of 22.3 hours. Further cross-breeding showed that the hamsters with the shorter circadian periods had one mutant copy of a gene ( tau ) that was dominant over their normal gene. After further breeding, Ralph and Menaker found that animals with two copies of the mutant tau gene had free-running periods of only 20 hours! The tau mutation was eventually identiﬁ ed as a speciﬁ c kinase that interacts with certain clock genes (see Figure 19.27). Hamsters with mutant circadian rhythms provided a con- vincing way to answer a fundamental question: Is the SCN the brain’s circadian clock? Ralph, Menaker, and their col- leagues found that when both SCNs of a hamster were ablated, rhythms were entirely lost. But rhythms could be restored to these ablated animals by simply transplanting a new SCN into their hypothalamus and waiting about a week. The key ﬁ nding was that hamsters receiving transplants adopted the circadian rhythm of the transplanted SCN, not the rhythm they were born with. In other words, if a genetically nor- mal hamster with SCN lesions received an SCN from a donor with one copy of the mutant tau gene, it subsequently cycled at about 22 hours. If its transplanted SCN came from an animal with two mutant tau s, it cycled at 20 hours. This is very com- pelling evidence that the SCN is the master circadian clock in the hamster brain and probably in our own brain as well. Short circadian periods were often devastating to a mutant hamster’s lifestyle when it was placed into normal  24-hour light and dark cycles. A hamster’s normal preference is to be active at night, but most tau animals could not completely entrain to the 24-hour rhythm. Instead, they found their activ- ity periods continually shifting through various parts of the light–dark cycle. A similar problem sometimes occurs in people, most often in the elderly. Due to an age-dependent shortening of the cir- cadian rhythm, overwhelming sleepiness begins in early eve- ning, and awakening comes at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning. Some people are unable to entrain their sleep–wake cycles to a daily rhythm and, like the mutant hamsters, ﬁ nd their activity cycles constantly shifting with respect to daylight. O F  S P E C I A L  I N T E R E S T BOX 19.5 \n679 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP Output axons of the SCN mainly innervate nearby parts of the hypo- thalamus, but some also go to the midbrain and other parts of the dien- cephalon. Because almost all SCN neurons use GABA as their primary neurotransmitter, presumably they inhibit the neurons they innervate. It is not yet clear how the SCN sets the timing of so many important behaviors. Extensive lesions in the efferent SCN pathways disrupt circa- dian rhythms. In addition to the axonal output pathways, SCN neurons may rhythmically secrete the peptide neuromodulator vasopressin (see Chapter 15). SCN Mechanisms How do neurons of the SCN keep time? It’s clear that each SCN cell is a minuscule clock that keeps time with regular ticks and tocks of its mo- lecular machinery. The ultimate isolation experiment has been simply to remove neurons from the SCN of an animal and grow each cell alone in a tissue culture dish, segregating them from the rest of the brain and from each other. Nevertheless, their rates of action potential ﬁ ring, glu- cose utilization, vasopressin production, and protein synthesis continue to vary with rhythms of about 24 hours, just as they do in the intact brain (Figure 19.26). SCN cells in culture can no longer be entrained to light– dark cycles (input from the eyes is necessary for this), but their basic rhythmicity remains intact and expresses itself just as it does when an animal is deprived of zeitgebers. SCN cells communicate their rhythmic message to the rest of the brain through efferent axons, using action potentials in the usual way, and rates of SCN cell ﬁ ring vary with a circadian rhythm. However, action potentials are not necessary for SCN neurons to maintain their rhythm. When tetrodotoxin (TTX), a blocker of sodium channels, is applied to SCN cells, it blocks their action potentials but has no effect on the rhythmicity of their metabolism and biochemical functions. When the TTX is removed, action potentials resume ﬁ ring with the same phase and frequency they had originally, before the TTX, implying that the SCN clock keeps run- ning even without action potentials. SCN action potentials are like the hands of a clock; removing the clock’s hands does not stop the innards of the clock from working, but it does make it impossible to read the time in the usual way. What is the nature of this clock that functions without action potentials? Research in a wide range of species indicates that it is a molecular cycle based on gene expression. The molecular clock used in humans is similar to those found in mice, fruit ﬂ ies ( Drosophila ), and even bread mold. In Drosophila and mice, the system involves a variety of clock genes. Some of the more important genes in mammals are known as period (per) , cryp- tochrome , and clock. Although the details vary across species, the basic scheme is a negative feedback loop. Many of the details were ﬁ rst worked out in experiments performed by Joseph Takahashi and his colleagues at Northwestern University, who named the clock gene (an acronym for circadian locomotor output cycles kaput ). A clock gene is transcribed to produce mRNA that is then translated into proteins. After a delay, the newly manufactured proteins send feedback and interact with the tran- scription mechanism, causing a decrease in gene expression. As a con- sequence of decreased transcription, less protein is produced, and gene expression again increases to start the cycle anew. This entire cycle takes about 24 hours, and thus it is a circadian rhythm (Figure 19.27). If each SCN neuron is a clock, there must be a mechanism to coordinate the thousands of cellular clocks so that the SCN as a whole  transmits a Activity (counts/h) 3000 1000 2000 0 0 Time (h) 12 24 36 48 ▲ FIGURE 19.26 Circadian rhythms of the SCN isolated from the rest of the brain.

Each neuron generates a strong circadian rhythm that is well coordinated with the other neurons.

Light informa- tion from the retina serves to reset the clocks in the SCN neurons each day, but the SCN neurons also communicate directly with each other. Surprisingly, the coordination of rhythms between SCN cells seems to be independent of action potentials and normal synaptic transmission because TTX does not block them. Also, the SCN of the very young rat brain coordinates circadian rhythms perfectly well, even before it has de- veloped any chemical synapses. The nature of neuron-to-neuron commu- nication within the SCN is poorly understood, but in addition to classical chemical synapses, it includes other chemical signals, electrical synapses (gap junctions), and the participation of glia. Research has shown that nearly every cell of the body, including those in the liver, kidney, and lung, has a circadian clock. The same types of gene transcription feedback loops that drive the SCN clock also drive the clocks in these peripheral tissues. When cells from liver, kid- ney, or lung are grown in isolation, each exhibits a circadian rhythm of its own. Under normal conditions in an intact body, however, all cells’ clocks are under the master control of the SCN. How does the SCN govern the innumerable clocks scattered throughout the body’s or- gans? Several signaling pathways seem to be important. The SCN has a strong circadian inﬂ uence on the autonomic nervous system, core body temperature, adrenal gland hormones such as cortisol, and neural cir- cuits that control feeding, movement, and metabolism (Figure 19.28). Each of these processes in turn regulates many of the body’s circadian clocks. Body temperature, for example, has a powerful effect on the clocks of peripheral tissues. It drops sharply by about 1°C each night under the inﬂ uence of the SCN (see Figure 19.22). This pulse of cooling helps to ensure that the clocks of the internal organs all remain set to the daily rhythms of the SCN and thus to the cycles of environmental dark and light. Interestingly, the SCN’s circadian clock is very resistant – Clock gene mRNA Protein Retinal input Output to brain SCN FIGURE 19.27 Clock genes.  In the SCN, clock genes produce proteins that inhibit further transcription. Gene transcription and the firing rate of individual SCN neurons cycle up and down over 24 hours. The cycles of many cells are synchronized by light exposure (input from the retina) and by interactions of the SCN neurons. \n681 CHAPTER 19 BRAIN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP to  temperature changes; this makes sense because it ensures that the SCN, which controls core temperature changes, is not destabilized by its own control signals. The complex systems that coordinate the body’s clocks are not perfect. Odd feeding schedules, chronic doses of methamphetamine and, as we mentioned previously, extreme living conditions (long-term cave dwell- ing) can all desynchronize the body’s circadian clocks. CONCLUDING REMARKS Rhythms are ubiquitous in the vertebrate central nervous system. They also span a broad range of frequencies, from more than 500 Hz in the cor- tical EEG to once per year (0.00000003 Hz) for many seasonal behaviors, such as the autumn mating of deer, the winter hibernation of chipmunks, and the instinct that drives migrating swallows to return to Capistrano, California every March 19. According to local legend, in 200 years, these swallows have missed the date only twice.

While the purpose of some rhythms is obvious, the functions of many neural rhythms are unknown. Indeed, some rhythms may have no func- tion at all but arise as a secondary consequence of neural interconnec- tions that are essential for other, nonrhythmic, purposes. Among the most conspicuous yet inexplicable of brain rhythms is sleep. Sleep provides a fascinating set of problems for neuroscience. Unlike most studies of single ion channels, single neurons, or the systems mediating perception and movement, sleep research begins with profound ignorance about a most basic question: Why? We still don’t know why we spend one- third of our lives sleeping, most of that time languid and vegetative and the rest of it paralyzed and hallucinating. Sleep and dreams may have no vital function, but they can be studied and enjoyed nevertheless. Ignoring the functional question will not be a satisfying approach for long, how- ever. For most neuroscientists, asking “Why?” remains the deepest and most challenging problem of all. R E V I E W  Q U E S T I O N S 1. Why do EEGs with relatively fast frequencies tend to have smaller amplitudes than EEGs with slower frequencies? 2. The human cerebral cortex is very large and must be folded extensively to ﬁ t within the skull. What do the foldings of the cortical surface do to the brain signals that are recorded by an EEG electrode at the scalp? 3. Sleep seems to be a behavior of every species of mammal, bird, and reptile. Does this mean that sleep performs a function essential for the life of these higher vertebrates? If you do not think so, what might be an explanation for the abundance of sleep? 4. An EEG during REM sleep is very similar to an EEG when awake. How do the brain and body in REM sleep differ from the brain and body when awake? 5. What is a likely explanation for the brain’s relative insensitivity to sensory input during REM sleep compared to the waking state? 6. The SCN receives direct input from the retina, via the retinohypothalamic tract, and this is how light–dark cycles can entrain circadian rhythms. If the retinal axons were somehow disrupted, what would be the likely effect on a person’s circadian rhythms of sleeping and waking? 7. What differences would there be in the behavioral consequences of a free-running circadian clock versus no clock at all?
