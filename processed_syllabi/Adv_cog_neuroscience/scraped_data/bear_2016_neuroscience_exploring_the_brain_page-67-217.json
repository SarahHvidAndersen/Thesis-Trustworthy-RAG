The resting potential of a typical neuron is about \u0003 65 millivolts (1 mV \u0005 0.001 volts). Stated another way, for a neuron at rest, V m \u0005 \u0003 65 mV. This negative resting membrane potential of the neuron is an absolute requirement for a functioning nervous system. To understand the negative membrane potential, we look to the ions that are present and how they are distributed inside and outside the neuron. Equilibrium Potentials Consider a hypothetical cell in which the inside is separated from the out- side by a pure phospholipid membrane with no proteins. Inside this cell, a concentrated potassium salt solution is dissolved, yielding K \u0002 and A \u0003 anions (any molecules with a negative charge). Outside the cell is a solu- tion with the same salt but diluted twentyfold with water. Although a large concentration gradient exists between the inside of the cell and the outside, there is no net movement of ions because the phospholipid bi- layer, having no channel proteins, is impermeable to charged, hydrophilic atoms. Under these conditions, a microelectrode would record no potential difference between the inside and the outside of the cell. In other words, V m would be equal to 0 mV because the ratio of K \u0002 to A \u0003 on each side of the membrane equals 1; both solutions are electrically neutral (Figure 3.12a). Consider how this situation would change if potassium channels were inserted into the phospholipid bilayer. Because of the selective perme- ability of these channels, K \u0002 would be free to pass across the membrane, but A \u0003 would not. Initially, diffusion rules: K \u0002 ions pass through the channels out of the cell, down the steep concentration gradient. Because A \u0003 is left behind, however, the inside of the cell membrane immediately begins to acquire a net negative charge, and an electrical potential dif- ference is established across the membrane (Figure 3.12b). As the inside K + A – A – K + K + A – A – K + (a) Inside \"cell\" Outside \"cell\" K + A – A – K + K + A – – + + – + – + – + – + – + – + – A – K + (c) K + A – A – K + K + A – A – K + K + A – + – + – + – A – K + (b) ▲ FIGURE 3.12 Establishing equilibrium in a selectively permeable membrane. (a) An imperme- able membrane separates two regions: one of high salt concentration (inside) and the other of low salt concentration (outside). The relative concentrations of potas- sium (K \u0002 ) and an impermeable anion (A \u0003 ) are represented by the sizes of the let- ters. (b) Inserting a channel that is selectively permeable to K \u0002 into the membrane initially results in a net movement of K \u0002 down their concentration gradient, from left to right. (c) A net accumulation of positive charge on the outside and negative charge on the inside retards the movement of positively charged K \u0002 from the inside to the outside. Equilibrium is established such that there is no net movement of ions across the membrane, leaving a charge difference between the two sides. \n68 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS acquires more and more net negative charge, the electrical force starts to pull positively charged K \u0002 ions back through the channels into the cell. When a certain potential difference is reached, the electrical force pull- ing K \u0002 ions inside exactly counterbalances the force of diffusion pushing them out. Thus, an equilibrium state is reached in which the diffusional and electrical forces are equal and opposite, and the net movement of K \u0002 across the membrane ceases (Figure 3.12c). The electrical potential dif- ference that exactly balances an ionic concentration gradient is called an ionic equilibrium potential , or simply equilibrium potential , and it is represented by the symbol E ion. In this example, the equilibrium poten- tial will be about \u0003 80 mV. The example in Figure 3.12 demonstrates that generating a steady electrical potential difference across a membrane is a relatively simple matter. All that is required is an ionic concentration gradient and selec- tive ionic permeability. Before moving on to the situation in real neurons, however, we can use this example to make four important points. 1. Large changes in membrane potential are caused by minuscule changes in ionic concentrations . In Figure 3.12, channels were inserted, and K \u0002 ions ﬂ owed out of the cell until the membrane potential went from 0 mV to the equilibrium potential of \u0003 80 mV. How much does this ionic redistribution affect the K \u0002 concentration on either side of the membrane? Not very much. For a cell with a 50 \u0007 m diameter, contain- ing 100 mM K \u0002 , it can be calculated that the concentration change re- quired to take the membrane from 0 to \u0003 80 mV is about 0.00001 mM. That is, when the channels were inserted and the K \u0002 ﬂ owed out until equilibrium was reached, the internal K \u0002 concentration went from 100 to 99.99999 mM—a negligible drop in concentration. 2. The net difference in electrical charge occurs at the inside and outside surfaces of the membrane . Because the phospholipid bilayer is so thin (less than 5 nm thick), it is possible for ions on one side to interact electrostatically with ions on the other side. Thus, the negative charges inside the neuron and the positive charges outside the neuron tend to be mutually attracted to the cell membrane. Consider how, on a warm summer evening, mosquitoes are attracted to the outside face of a win- dow pane when the inside lights are on. Similarly, the net negative charge inside the cell is not distributed evenly in the cytosol but rather is localized at the inner face of the membrane (Figure 3.13). In this way, the membrane is said to store electrical charge, a property called capacitance . 3. Ions are driven across the membrane at a rate proportional to the dif- ference between the membrane potential and the equilibrium potential . Notice in our example in Figure 3.12 that when the channels were inserted, there was a net movement of K \u0002 only as long as the electri- cal membrane potential differed from the equilibrium potential. The difference between the real membrane potential and the equilibrium potential (V m \u0003 E ion ) for a particular ion is called the ionic driving force . We’ll talk more about this in Chapters 4 and 5 when we discuss the movement of ions across the membrane during the action potential and synaptic transmission. 4. If the concentration difference across the membrane is known for an ion, the equilibrium potential can be calculated for that ion . In our example in Figure 3.12, we assumed that K \u0002 was more concentrated inside the cell. Based on this knowledge, we were able to deduce that the equi- librium potential would be negative if the membrane were selectively permeable to K \u0002 . Let’s consider another example, in which Na \u0002 is more + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – + + – + – + – + – + – + – Equal +,– Cytosol Extracellular fluid Membrane Equal +,– Equal +,– ▲ FIGURE 3.13 The distribution of electrical charge across the membrane. The uneven charges inside and outside the neuron line up along the membrane because of electrostatic attraction across this very thin barrier. Notice that the bulk of the cytosol and extracellular fluid is electri- cally neutral. \n69 CHAPTER 3 THE NEURONAL MEMBRANE AT REST concentrated outside the cell (Figure 3.14). If the membrane contains sodium channels, Na \u0002 would ﬂ ow down the concentration gradient into the cell. The entry of positively charged ions would cause the cytosol on the inner surface of the membrane to acquire a net positive charge. The positively charged interior of the cell membrane would now repel Na \u0002 ions, tending to push them back out through their channels. At a certain potential difference, the electrical force pushing Na \u0002 ions out would exactly counterbalance the force of diffusion pushing them in. In this example, the membrane potential at equilibrium would be positive on the inside. The examples in Figures 3.12 and 3.14 illustrate that if we know the ionic concentration difference across the membrane, we can ﬁ gure out the equilibrium potential for any ion. Prove it to yourself. Assume that Ca 2 \u0002 is more concentrated on the outside of the cell and that the membrane is selectively permeable to Ca 2 \u0002 . See if you can ﬁ gure out whether the inside of the cell would be positive or negative at equilibrium. Try it again, as- suming that the membrane is selectively permeable to Cl \u0003 , and that Cl \u0003 is more concentrated outside the cell. (Pay attention here; note the charge of the ion.) The preceding examples show that each ion has its own equilibrium po- tential—the steady electrical potential that would occur if the membrane were permeable only to that ion. Thus, we can speak of the potassium equilibrium potential, E K ; the sodium equilibrium potential, E Na ; the cal- cium equilibrium potential, E Ca ; and so on. And knowing the electrical charge of the ion and the concentration difference across the membrane, we can easily deduce whether the inside of the cell would be positive or negative at equilibrium. In fact, the exact value of an equilibrium poten- tial in mV can be calculated using an equation derived from the principles of physical chemistry, the Nernst equation , which takes into consider- Na Na + A – A – Na Na + Na + A – A – Na + (a) Inside \"cell\" Outside \"cell\" A – A – Na Na + Na Na + + – + – + – + – + – + – + – + – A – A – Na + Na + (c) A – A – Na Na + Na Na + A – A – Na Na + Na Na + A – Na Na + A – A – Na Na + A – + – + – + – Na + Na + (b) ▲ FIGURE 3.14 Another example of establishing equilibrium in a selectively permeable mem- brane. (a) An impermeable membrane separates two regions: one of high salt concentration (outside) and the other of low salt concentration (inside). (b) Insert- ing a channel that is selectively permeable to Na \u0002 into the membrane initially re- sults in a net movement of Na \u0002 down its concentration gradient, from right to left. (c) A net accumulation of positive charge on the inside and negative charge on the outside retards the movement of positively charged Na \u0002 from the outside to the inside. Equilibrium is established such that there is no net movement of ions across the membrane, leaving a charge difference between the two sides; in this case, the inside of the cell is positively charged with respect to the outside. \n70 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS ation the charge of the ion, the temperature, and the ratio of the external and internal ion concentrations. Using the Nernst equation, we can cal- culate the value of the equilibrium potential for any ion. For example, if K \u0002 is concentrated twentyfold on the inside of a cell, the Nernst equation tells us that E K \u0005 \u0003 80 mV (Box 3.2). The Distribution of Ions Across the Membrane It should now be clear that the neuronal membrane potential depends on the ionic concentrations on both sides of the membrane. Approximate val- ues for these concentrations appear in Figure 3.15. The important point is that K \u0002 is more concentrated on the inside, and Na \u0002 and Ca 2 \u0002 are more concentrated on the outside . How do these concentration gradients arise? Ionic concentration gradients are established by the actions of ion pumps in the neuronal membrane. Two ion pumps are especially important in cellular neuro- physiology: the sodium-potassium pump and the calcium pump. The BOX 3.2 The Nernst Equation T he equilibrium potential for an ion can be calculated using the Nernst equation: E ion \u0005 2.303 RT zF log [ion] o [ion] i where E ion \u0005 ionic equilibrium potential R \u0005 gas constant T \u0005 absolute temperature z \u0005 charge of the ion F \u0005 Faraday’s constant log \u0005 base 10 logarithm [ion] o \u0005 ionic concentration outside the cell [ion] i \u0005 ionic concentration inside the cell The Nernst equation can be derived from the basic prin- ciples of physical chemistry. Let’s see if we can make some sense of it. Remember that equilibrium is the balance of two in- fluences: diffusion, which pushes an ion down its con- centration gradient, and electricity, which causes an ion to be attracted to opposite charges and repelled by like charges. Increasing the thermal energy of each particle increases diffusion and therefore increases the potential difference achieved at equilibrium. Thus, E ion is propor- tional to T. On the other hand, increasing the electrical charge of each particle decreases the potential difference needed to  balance diffusion. Therefore, E ion is inversely proportional to the charge of the ion (z). We need not worry about R and F in the Nernst equation because they are constants. B R A I N  F O O D At body temperature (37°C), the Nernst equation for the important ions—K \u0002 , Na \u0002 , Cl \u0003 , and Ca 2 \u0002 — simpliﬁ es to: E K \u0005 61.54 mV log [K \u0002 ] o [K \u0002 ] i \u0003 E Na \u0005 61.54 mV log [Na \u0002 ] o [Na \u0002 ] i E Cl \u0005 61.54 mV log [Cl \u0003 ] o [Cl \u0003 ] i E Ca \u0005 30.77 mV log [Ca 2 \u0002 ] o [Ca 2 \u0002 ] i Therefore, to calculate the equilibrium potential for a cer- tain type of ion at body temperature, all we need to know is the ionic concentrations on either side of the membrane. For instance, in the example we used in Figure 3.12, we stipulated that K \u0002 was twentyfold more concentrated inside the cell: If [K \u0002 ] o [K \u0002 ] \u0005 1 20 and log 1 20 \u0005 \u0003 1.3 then E K \u0005 61.54 mV \u0006 \u0003 1.3 \u0005 \u0003 80 mV. Notice that there is no term in the Nernst equation for per- meability or ionic conductance. Thus, calculating the value of E ion does not require knowledge of the selectivity or the permeability of the membrane for the ion. There is an equilib- rium potential for each ion in the intracellular and extracellular ﬂ uid. E ion is the membrane potential that would just balance the ion’s concentration gradient, so that no net ionic current would ﬂ ow if the membrane were permeable to that ion. \n71 CHAPTER 3 THE NEURONAL MEMBRANE AT REST K + Na + Ca 2+ Cl – 5 150 2 150 100 15 0.0002 13 1 : 20 10 : 1 10,000 : 1 11.5 : 1 –80 mV 62 mV 123 mV –65 mV Ion Concentration outside (in mM) Concentration inside (in mM) Ratio Out : In E ion (at 37 ∞ C) Inside Outside ▲ FIGURE 3.15 Approximate ion concentrations on either side of a neuronal membrane. E ion is the membrane potential that would be achieved (at body temperature) if the membrane were selectively permeable to that ion. sodium-potassium pump is an enzyme that breaks down ATP in the presence of internal Na \u0002 . The chemical energy released by this reaction drives the pump, which exchanges internal Na \u0002 for external K \u0002 . The ac- tions of this pump ensure that K \u0002 is concentrated inside the neuron and that Na \u0002 is concentrated outside. Notice that the pump pushes these ions across the membrane against their concentration gradients (Figure 3.16). This work requires the expenditure of metabolic energy. Indeed, it has been estimated that the sodium-potassium pump expends as much as 70% of the total amount of ATP utilized by the brain. The calcium pump is also an enzyme that actively transports Ca 2 \u0002 out of the cytosol across the cell membrane. Additional mechanisms decrease intracellular [Ca 2 \u0002 ] to a very low level (0.0002 mM); these in- clude intracellular calcium-binding proteins and organelles, such as mi- tochondria and types of endoplasmic reticulum, which sequester cytosolic calcium ions. Ion pumps are the unsung heroes of cellular neurophysiology. They work in the background to ensure that the ionic concentration gradients \n72 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS are established and maintained. These proteins may lack the glamour of a gated ion channel, but without ion pumps, the resting membrane poten- tial would not exist and the brain would not function. Relative Ion Permeabilities of the Membrane at Rest The pumps establish ionic concentration gradients across the neuronal membrane. With knowledge of these ionic concentrations, we can use the Nernst equation to calculate equilibrium potentials for the different ions (see Figure 3.15). Remember, though, that an equilibrium potential for an ion is the membrane potential that would result if a membrane were selectively permeable to that ion alone. In reality, however, neurons are not permeable to only a single type of ion. How does that affect our understanding? Let’s consider a few scenarios involving K \u0002 and Na \u0002 . If the membrane of a neuron were permeable only to K \u0002 , the membrane potential would equal E K , which, according to Figure 3.15, is \u0003 80 mV. On the other hand, if the membrane of a neuron were permeable only to Na \u0002 , the membrane potential would equal E Na , 62 mV. If the membrane were equally perme- able to K \u0002 and Na \u0002 , however, the resulting membrane potential would be some average of E Na and E K . What if the membrane were 40 times more permeable to K \u0002 than it is to Na \u0002 ? The membrane potential again would be between E Na and E K but much closer to E K than to E Na . This approxi- mates the situation in real neurons. The actual resting membrane poten- tial of \u0003 65 mV approaches, but does not reach, the potassium  equilibrium potential of \u0003 80 mV. This difference arises because, although the mem- brane at rest is highly permeable to K \u0002 , there is also a steady leak of Na \u0002 into the cell. The resting membrane potential can be calculated using the Goldman equation , a mathematical formula that takes into consideration the rel- ative permeability of the membrane to different ions. If we concern our- selves only with K \u0002 and Na \u0002 , use the ionic concentrations in Figure 3.15, and assume that the resting membrane permeability to K \u0002 is fortyfold greater than it is to Na \u0002 , then the Goldman equation predicts a resting membrane potential of \u0003 65 mV, the observed value (Box 3.3).

This ion pump is a membrane-associated protein that transports ions across the membrane against their concentration gradients at the expense of metabolic energy. \n73 CHAPTER 3 THE NEURONAL MEMBRANE AT REST The Wide World of Potassium Channels. As we have seen, the selective permeability of potassium channels is a key determinant of the resting membrane potential and therefore of neuronal function. What is the mo- lecular basis for this ionic selectivity? Selectivity for K \u0002 ions derives from the arrangement of amino acid residues that line the pore regions of the channels. It was a major breakthrough in 1987 when researchers suc- ceeded in determining the amino acid sequences of a family of potassium channels in the fruit ﬂ y Drosophila melanogaster . While these insects may be annoying in the kitchen, they are extremely valuable in the lab because their genes can be studied and manipulated in ways that are not possible in mammals. Normal ﬂ ies, like humans, can be put to sleep with ether vapors. While conducting research on anesthetized insects, investigators discovered that ﬂ ies of one mutant strain responded to the ether by shaking their legs, wings, and abdomen. This strain of ﬂ y was designated Shaker . Detailed studies soon explained the odd behavior by a defect in a particular type of potassium channel (Figure 3.17a). Using molecular biological techniques, it was possible to map the gene that was mutated in Shaker . Knowledge of the DNA sequence of what is now called the Shake r potassium chan- nel enabled researchers to ﬁ nd the genes for other potassium channels based on sequence similarity. This analysis has revealed the existence of a very large number of different potassium channels, including those responsible for maintaining the resting membrane potential in neurons. Most potassium channels have four subunits that are arranged like the staves of a barrel to form a pore (Figure 3.17b). Despite their diversity, the subunits of different potassium channels have common structural features that bestow selectivity for K \u0002 . Of particular interest is a region called the pore loop , which contributes to the selectivity ﬁ lter that makes the channel permeable mostly to K \u0002 (Figure 3.18). In addition to ﬂ ies, the deadly scorpion also made an important contri- bution to the discovery of the pore loop as the selectivity ﬁ lter. In 1988, Brandeis University biologist Chris Miller and his student Roderick MacKinnon observed that scorpion toxin blocks potassium channels BOX 3.3 The Goldman Equation I f the membrane of a real neuron were permeable only to K \u0002 , the resting membrane potential would equal E K , about \u0003 80 mV. But it does not; the measured resting membrane poten- tial of a typical neuron is about \u0003 65 mV. This discrepancy is explained because real neurons at rest are not exclusively per- meable to K \u0002 ; there is also some Na \u0002 permeability. Stated another way, the relative permeability of the resting neuronal membrane is quite high to K \u0002 and low to Na \u0002 . If the relative permeabilities are known, it is possible to calculate the mem- brane potential at equilibrium by using the Goldman equation. Thus, for a membrane permeable only to Na \u0002 and K \u0002 at 37° C: V m \u0005 61.54 mV log P K [K \u0002 ] o \u0002 P Na [Na \u0002 ] o P K [K \u0002 ] i \u0002 P Na [Na \u0002 ] i B R A I N  F O O D where V m is the membrane potential, P K and P Na are the rela- tive permeabilities to K \u0002 and Na \u0002 , respectively, and the other terms are the same as for the Nernst equation. If the resting membrane ion permeability to K \u0002 is 40 times greater than it is to Na \u0002 , then solving the Goldman equation using the concentrations in Figure 3.15 yields: V m \u0005 61.54 mV log 40 (5) \u0002 1 (150) 40 (100) \u0002 1 (15) \u0005 61.54 mV log 350 4015 \u0005 \u0003 65 mV \n74 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS (and poisons its victims) by binding tightly to a site within the channel pore. They used the toxin to identify the precise stretch of amino acids that forms the inside walls and selectivity ﬁ lter of the channel (Box 3.4). MacKinnon went on to solve the three-dimensional atomic structure of a potassium channel. This accomplishment revealed, at long last, the phys- ical basis of ion selectivity and earned MacKinnon the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. It is now understood that mutations involving only a single amino acid in this region can severely disrupt neuronal function. An example of this is seen in a strain of mice called Weaver . These animals have difﬁ culty maintaining posture and moving normally. The defect has been traced to the mutation of a single amino acid in the pore loop of a potassium channel found in speciﬁ c neurons of the cerebellum, a region of the brain important for motor coordination. As a consequence of the mutation, Na \u0002 as well as K \u0002 can pass through the channel. Increased sodium permeability causes the membrane potential of the neurons to become less negative, thus disrupting neuronal function. (Indeed, the absence of the normal negative membrane potential in these cells is be- lieved to be the cause of their untimely death.) In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that many inherited neurological disorders in humans, such as certain forms of epilepsy, are explained by mutations of speciﬁ c potassium channels.

(b) The Shaker potassium channel has four subunits arranged like staves of a barrel to form a pore. Enlargement: The tertiary structure of the protein subunit contains a pore loop, a part of the poly- peptide chain that makes a hairpin turn within the plane of the membrane. The pore loop is a critical part of the filter that makes the channel selectively perme- able to K \u0002 . \n75 CHAPTER 3 THE NEURONAL MEMBRANE AT REST The Importance of Regulating the External Potassium Concentration. Because the neuronal membrane at rest is mostly permeable to K \u0002 , the mem- brane potential is close to E K . Another consequence of high K \u0002 permeability is that the membrane potential is particularly sensitive to changes in the concentration of extracellular potassium. This relationship is shown in Figure 3.19. A tenfold change in the K \u0002 concentration outside the cell, [K \u0002 ] o , from 5 to 50 mM, would change the membrane potential from \u0003 65 to \u0003 17 mV. A change in membrane potential from the normal resting  value ( \u0003 65 mV) to a less negative value is called a depolarization of the membrane. Therefore, increasing extracellular potassium depolarizes neurons . ▲ FIGURE 3.18 A view of the potassium channel pore. The atomic structure of potassium-se- lective ion channels has recently been solved. Here we are looking into the pore from the outside in a three-dimensional model of the atomic structure.

Because the neuronal membrane at rest is mostly permeable to potassium, a tenfold change in [K \u0002 ] o , from 5 to 50 mM, causes a 48 mV depolarization of the membrane. This function was calculated using the Goldman equation (see Box 3.3). \n76 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS F or me, the practice of scientiﬁ c discovery has always been tightly linked to play. The self-indulgent pleasure of just ﬁ ddling around with a problem is what motivated the early stages of every research project I’ve ever engaged in. Only later comes the intense itch scratching, scholarship, and sweat needed to attack—and sometimes solve—the puzzles presented by na- ture. The sandbox I’ve been playing in for the past 40 years contains what are to me the most fascinating of toys: ion chan- nels, the membrane-spanning proteins that literally make the electrical signals of neurons, breathing life into the nervous sys- tem. To the extent that the brain is a computer—an inaccurate but evocative analogy—the ion channels are the transistors. In response to biological dictates, these tiny proteinaceous pores form diffusion pathways for ions such as Na \u0002 , K \u0002 , Ca 2 \u0002 , H \u0002 , and Cl \u0003 , which carry electrical charge across membranes, thereby generating, propagating, and regulating cell voltage sig- nals. I fell in love with these proteins long ago when I acciden- tally stumbled upon an unexpected K \u0002 channel in experiments initially aimed at capturing a completely different sort of beast, a Ca 2 \u0002 -activated enzyme, and over the years that love has only deepened as I’ve wandered around in a teeming electrophysi- ological zoo housing many species of ion channel proteins. An undergraduate background in physics and subsequent experience as a high school math teacher delivered me in the 1970s to graduate school, post-doctoral training, and my own lab at Brandeis with no formal preparation in (and precious little knowledge of) neurobiology or electrophysiol- ogy. Picking up bits and pieces of these subjects from read- ing the literature and osmosing them from my surroundings, I became increasingly fascinated by how ion channels, at that time only just nailed down as proteins, could do their job of producing bioelectricity; in parallel, I grew increasingly horriﬁ ed by what struck me as the overwhelming complexity of living cells and the ambiguity in molecular interpretation that would inevitably accompany experiments done exclusively on cel- lular membranes. This combination of fascination and horror provoked my attraction to simpliﬁ ed “artiﬁ cial membranes” of deﬁ ned composition, developed by Paul Mueller in the 1960s, with which to follow the electrical activities of ion channels isolated from their complex cellular homes. I worked out a method for inserting single channel molecules from excitable cells into these chemically controllable membranes and used it to  record single K \u0002 channels at a time when card-carrying neurobiologists were beginning to observe single channels in native excitable membranes with the then-new cellular patch- recording methods. I confess that my early technique-building experiments were just play. To watch and control individual protein molecules dancing electrically before my eyes in real time was—and still is—an indescribable thrill, regardless of the particular tasks the channels carry out for the cell. P A T H  O F  D I S C O V E R Y BOX 3.4 Feeling Around Inside Ion Channels in the Dark The sensitivity of the membrane potential to [K \u0002 ] o has led to the evolution of mechanisms that tightly regulate extracellular potassium concentrations in the brain. One of these is the blood-brain barrier , a specialization of the walls of brain capillaries that limits the movement of potassium (and other bloodborne substances) into the extracellular ﬂ uid of the brain. Glia, particularly astrocytes, also possess efﬁ cient mechanisms to take up extracellular K \u0002 whenever concentrations rise, as they normally do during periods of neural activity. Remember, astrocytes ﬁ ll most of the space between neurons in the brain. Astrocytes have membrane potassium pumps that concentrate K \u0002 in their cytosol, and they also have potassium channels. When [K \u0002 ] o increases, K \u0002 enters the astro- cyte through the potassium channels, causing the astrocyte membrane to depolarize. The entry of K \u0002 increases the internal potassium concen- tration, [K \u0002 ] i , which is believed to be dissipated over a large area by the extensive network of astrocytic processes. This mechanism for the regulation of [K \u0002 ] o by astrocytes is called potassium spatial buffering (Figure 3.20). \n77 CHAPTER 3 THE NEURONAL MEMBRANE AT REST Eventually, this play led me to compelling problems that could be advantageously attacked with this reductionist ap- proach. By the mid-1980s, my lab was home to a collection of supremely talented post-docs—Gary Yellen, Rod MacKinnon, and Jacques Neyton among them—going after the remarkable ion selectivity of various K \u0002 channels: How do they tell the dif- ference between ions as similar as K \u0002 and Na \u0002 , as they must do if neurons are to ﬁ re action potentials, and if we are to think, feel, and act? Having stumbled, while purposelessly fooling around with natural neurotoxins, on a scorpion venom peptide that blocks K \u0002 channels, we used the power of single-channel analysis to show that this toxin works by plugging up the pro- tein’s K \u0002 -selective pore, just like a cork in a bottle (Figure A). In 1988, Rod took our toxin peptide to a Cold Spring Harbor labo- ratory course he’d signed up for to learn how to express ion channels by recombinant DNA methods. There he made a key discovery: that the toxin also blocks Shaker , the ﬁ rst genetically manipulable K \u0002 channel, cloned the previous year in the lab of Lily and Yuh-Nung Jan. This chance ﬁ nding led us, by making speciﬁ c mutations, to a localized region in the channel’s amino acid sequence that forms the outer entryway of the K \u0002 selec- tive pore, a result immediately applicable to the entire family of voltage-dependent K \u0002 , Na \u0002 , and Ca 2 \u0002 channels. A few years later, Rod and Gary, as newly hatched independent investiga- tors, collaboratively homed in on these pore sequences to ﬁ nd the ion-selectivity hot spots, a result that propelled Rod, 7 years later, to bag the ﬁ rst X-ray crystal structure of a K \u0002 channel and to begin a whole new “structural era” in ion channel studies. Looking back at my wrestling matches with ion channels, it is clear that the greatest joy I’ve derived from this endeavor has arisen from seeing—and being surprised by—new and unexpected elements of beauty and coherence in the natural world. This feeling was described by the great theoretical physi- cist Richard Feynman who, in a riposte to a W.H. Auden poem that dismisses scientiﬁ c motivation as merely utilitarian, asserted that research scientists, like poets, are driven mainly by aesthetic forces: “We want knowledge so we can love Nature more.” Figure A The extracellular opening of a K \u0002 channel with bound scorpion toxin envisioned indirectly in the “pre-structural” days by probing the chan- nel with the toxin of known structure. Points of interaction: site on channel that makes contact with toxin (dark blue circles), key lysine residue on toxin that intrudes into the narrow pore (pale blue circle with \u0002 ), a K \u0002 displaced downward into the pore by binding of toxin (yellow circle with \u0002 ). The yellow scale bar represents 2 nm. (Source: Adapted from Goldstein et al. 1994. Neuron 12:1377–1388.)

When brain [K \u0002 ] o increases as a result of local neural activity, K \u0002 enters astrocytes via membrane chan- nels. The extensive network of astro- cytic processes helps dissipate the K \u0002 over a large area. It is important to recognize that not all excitable cells are protected from increases in potassium. Muscle cells, for example, do not have equivalents to the blood-brain barrier or glial buffering mechanisms. Consequently, although the brain is relatively protected, elevations of [K \u0002 ] in the blood can still have serious consequences on body physiology (Box 3.5). \n78 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS O F  S P E C I A L  I N T E R E S T BOX 3.5 Death by Lethal Injection O n June 4, 1990, Dr. Jack Kevorkian shocked the medical profession by assisting in the suicide of Janet Adkins. Adkins, a 54-year-old, happily married mother of three, had been di- agnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, a progressive brain dis- order that always results in senile dementia and death. Mrs. Adkins had been a member of the Hemlock Society, which advocates euthanasia as an alternative to death by terminal illness. Dr. Kevorkian agreed to help Mrs. Adkins take her own life. In the back of a 1968 Volkswagen van at a camp- site in Oakland County, Michigan, she was hooked to an intravenous line that infused a harmless saline solution. To choose death, Mrs. Adkins switched the solution to one that contained an anesthetic solution, followed automatically by potassium chloride. The anesthetic caused Mrs. Adkins to become unconscious by suppressing the activity of neurons in part of the brain called the reticular formation . Cardiac ar- rest and death were then caused by the KCl injection. The ionic basis of the resting membrane potential explains why the heart stopped beating. Recall that the proper functioning of excitable cells (including those of cardiac muscle) requires that their membranes be main- tained at the appropriate resting potential whenever they are not generating impulses. The negative resting potential is a result of selective ionic permeability to K \u0002 and to the metabolic pumps that concentrate potassium inside the cell. However, as Figure 3.19 shows, membrane potential is very sensitive to changes in the extracellular concentration of potassium. A tenfold rise in extra- cellular K \u0002 would severely diminish the resting potential. Although neurons in the brain are somewhat protected from large changes in [K \u0002 ] o , other excitable cells in the body, such as muscle cells, are not. Without negative resting potentials, cardiac muscle cells can no longer generate the impulses that lead to contraction, and the heart immediately stops beating. Intravenous potassium chloride is, therefore, a lethal injection.

The activity of the sodium-potassium pump produces and maintains a large K \u0002 concen- tration gradient across the membrane. The neuronal membrane at rest is highly permeable to K \u0002 , owing to the presence of membrane potas- sium channels. The movement of K \u0002 ions across the membrane, down their concentration gradient, leaves the inside of the neuronal membrane negatively charged. The electrical potential difference across the membrane can be thought of as a battery whose charge is maintained by the work of the ion pumps. In the next chapter, we see how this battery runs our brain. C O N CL U D ING R E M A R KS \n79 CHAPTER 3 THE NEURONAL MEMBRANE AT REST R E V I E W  Q U E S T I O N S 1.

As we saw in Chapter 3, the inside of the neuronal membrane at rest is negatively charged in relation to the outside. The action potential is a rapid reversal of this situation such that, for an instant, the inside of the membrane becomes positively charged in relation to the outside. The action potential is also often called a spike , a nerve impulse , or a discharge . The action potentials generated by a patch of membrane are all simi- lar in size and duration, and they do not diminish as they are conducted down the axon. Keep in mind the big picture: The frequency and pattern of action potentials constitute the code used by neurons to transfer informa- tion from one location to another. In this chapter, we discuss the mecha- nisms that are responsible for the action potential and how it propagates down the axonal membrane. PROPERTIES OF THE ACTION POTENTIAL Action potentials have certain universal properties, features that are shared by axons in the nervous systems of every animal, from a squid to a college student. Let’s begin by exploring some of these properties. What does the action potential look like? How is it initiated? How rapidly can a neuron generate action potentials? The Ups and Downs of an Action Potential In Chapter 3, we saw that the membrane potential, V m , can be determined by inserting a microelectrode in the cell. A voltmeter is used to measure the electrical potential difference between the tip of this intracellular microelectrode and another placed outside the cell. When the neuronal membrane is at rest, the voltmeter reads a steady potential difference of about \u0002 65 mV. During the action potential, however, the membrane po- tential brieﬂ y becomes positive. Because this occurs so rapidly—100 times faster than the blink of an eye—a special type of voltmeter, called an oscilloscope , is used to study action potentials. The oscilloscope records the voltage as it changes over time (Box 4.1). An action potential, as it would appear on the display of an oscillo- scope, is shown in Figure 4.1. This graph represents a plot of membrane potential versus time. Notice that the action potential has certain identi- ﬁ able parts. The ﬁ rst part, called the rising phase , is characterized by a rapid depolarization of the membrane. This change in membrane poten- tial continues until V m reaches a peak value of about 40 mV. The part of the action potential where the inside of the neuron is positively charged with respect to the outside is called the overshoot . The falling phase of the action potential is a rapid repolarization until the inside of the mem- brane is actually more negative than the resting potential. This last part of the falling phase is called the undershoot , or after-hyperpolariza- tion . Finally, there is a gradual restoration of the resting potential. From beginning to end, the action potential lasts about 2 milliseconds (msec). The Generation of an Action Potential In Chapter 3, we said that breaking of the skin by a thumbtack was sufﬁ - cient to generate action potentials in a sensory nerve. Let’s continue that example to see how an action potential begins. I NT R O D U C TIO N P R O P E R T I E S OF T HE A C TI ON P O TENTI AL \n83 CHAPTER 4 THE ACTION POTENTIAL The perception of sharp pain when a thumbtack enters your foot is caused by the generation of action potentials in certain nerve ﬁ bers in the skin. (We’ll learn more about pain in Chapter 12.) The membrane of these ﬁ bers has a type of gated sodium channel that opens when the nerve end- ing is stretched. The chain of events therefore begins this way: (1) The thumbtack enters the skin, (2) the membrane of the nerve ﬁ bers in the skin is stretched, (3) and Na \u0003 -permeable channels open. Because of the large concentration gradient and the negative charge of the inside of the membrane, Na \u0003 crosses the membrane through these channels. The entry of Na \u0003 depolarizes the membrane; that is, the cytoplasmic (inside) sur- face of the membrane becomes less negative. If this depolarization, called BOX 4.1 Methods of Recording Action Potentials M ethods for studying nerve impulses may be broadly di- vided into two types: intracellular and extracellular (Figure A). Intracellular recording requires impaling the neuron or axon with a microelectrode. The small size of most neurons makes this method challenging, which is why so many early studies of action potentials were performed on the neurons of inver- tebrates, which can be 50–100 times larger than mammalian neurons. Fortunately, recent technical advances have made even the smallest vertebrate neurons accessible to intracel- lular recording methods, and these studies have conﬁ rmed that much of what was learned in invertebrates is directly applicable to humans. The goal of intracellular recording is simple: to measure the potential difference between the tip of the intracellular electrode and another electrode placed in the solution bath- ing the neuron (electrically continuous with the earth, and thus called ground). The intracellular electrode is ﬁ lled with a concentrated salt solution (often KCl) having a high electri- cal conductivity. The electrode is connected to an ampliﬁ er that compares the potential difference between this elec- trode and ground. This potential difference can be displayed using an oscilloscope. Early oscilloscopes worked by sweep- ing a beam of electrons from left to right across a phosphor screen. Vertical deﬂ ections of this beam show changes in voltage. Oscilloscopes today take a digital record of voltage across time, but the principle is the same. It is really just a sophisticated voltmeter that can record rapid changes in volt- age (such as an action potential). As we shall see, the action potential is characterized by a sequence of ionic movements across the neuronal membrane. These electrical currents can be detected, without impaling the neuron, by placing an electrode near the membrane. This is the principle behind extracellular recording . Again, we mea- sure the potential difference between the tip of the record- ing electrode and ground. The electrode can be a ﬁ ne glass capillary ﬁ lled with a salt solution, but it is often simply a thin insulated metal wire. Normally, in the absence of neural activ- ity, the potential difference between the extracellular record- ing electrode and ground is zero. However, when the action potential arrives at the recording position, positive charges ﬂ ow away from the record- ing electrode into the neuron. Then, as the action potential passes by, positive charges ﬂ ow out across the membrane toward the recording electrode. Thus, the extracellular action potential is characterized by a brief, alternating voltage difference between the recording electrode and ground. (Notice the different scale of the voltage changes pro- duced by the action potential recorded with intracellular and extracellular recordings.) These changes in voltage can be seen using an oscilloscope, but they can also be heard by connecting the output of the ampliﬁ er to a loudspeaker. Each impulse makes a dis- tinctive “pop” sound. Indeed, recording the activity of an active sensory nerve sounds just like popping popcorn.

The critical level of depolarization that must be reached in order to trigger an action potential is called threshold . Action potentials are caused by depolarization of the membrane beyond threshold. The depolarization that causes action potentials arises in different ways in different neurons. In our previous example, depolarization was caused by the entry of Na \u0003 through specialized ion channels that were sensitive to membrane stretching. In interneurons, depolarization is usually caused by Na \u0003 entry through channels that are sensitive to neurotransmitters released by other neurons. In addition to these natural routes, neurons can be depo- larized by injecting electrical current through a microelectrode, a method commonly used by neuroscientists to study action potentials in different cells. Generating an action potential by depolarizing a neuron is something like taking a photograph by pressing the shutter button on an old-fashioned camera. Applying pressure on the button has no effect until it increases to the point of crossing a threshold, and then “click”—the shutter opens and one frame of ﬁ lm is exposed. Increasing depolarization of a neuron simi- larly has no effect until it crosses threshold, and then “pop”—one action potential. For this reason, action potentials are said to be “all-or-none.” The Generation of Multiple Action Potentials Earlier we likened the generation of an action potential by depolarization to taking a photograph by pressing the shutter button on a camera. But what if the camera is one of those fancy ones used by fashion and sports photog- raphers where continued pressure on the button causes the camera to shoot frame after frame? The same thing is true for a neuron. If, for example, we pass continuous depolarizing current into a neuron through a microelectrode, we generate not one but many action potentials in succession (Figure 4.2). The rate of action potential generation depends on the magnitude of the continuous depolarizing current. If we pass enough current through a microelectrode to depolarize just to threshold, but not far beyond, we might ﬁ nd that the cell generates action potentials at a rate of something like one per second, or one hertz (1 Hz). If we crank up the current a little bit more, however, we will ﬁ nd that the rate of action potential generation increases, –80 –60 –40 –20 20 40 0 1 2 Time (msec) Membrane potential (mV) 0 mV Overshoot Falling phase (a) (b) Rising phase Resting potential Undershoot 0 ▲ FIGURE 4.1 An action potential.

Thus, the ﬁ ring frequency of action potentials reﬂ ects the magnitude of the depolarizing current. This is one way that stimulation intensity is encoded in the nervous system (Figure 4.3). Although ﬁ ring frequency increases with the amount of depolarizing current, there is a limit to the rate at which a neuron can generate action potentials. The maximum ﬁ ring frequency is about 1000 Hz; once an action potential is initiated, it is impossible to initiate another for about 1 msec. This period of time is called the absolute refractory period .

FIGURE 4.3 The dependence of action potential firing frequency on the level of  depolarization. \n86 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS W hen I returned in 1992 to the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics in Frankfurt, Germany, from my post-doctoral studies at Yale and Rockefeller University, I was mostly inter- ested in the mechanisms that establish ion gradients across cell membranes. Ernst Bamberg, the director of my depart- ment, convinced me to undertake a novel approach in study- ing microbial rhodopsins—proteins that transport ions across membranes when they absorb light energy. We expressed the gene for bacteriorhodopsin in frog eggs (oocytes), and measured its light-activated electrical current with microelec- trodes. In 1995, we demonstrated that illumination of bacteri- orhodopsin triggered proton (H \u0003 ) pumping across the oocyte membrane. We then went on in 1996 to study the light-acti- vated chloride pump halorhodopsin with this new technique. We also received DNA for chlamyopsin-1 and -2, proposed to be photoreceptor proteins in the green alga Chlamydomonas re- inhardtii , from Peter Hegemann at the University of Regensburg. Unfortunately, like all the other labs who received this DNA, we were unable to observe any light-induced electrical signals. Nevertheless, I agreed to test the function of a new presumed rhodopsin from Chlamydomonas when Peter called me, an- nouncing that they had found a “real light-gated calcium chan- nel,” which he wanted to name chlamyrhodopsin-3. Although this new protein had not been puriﬁ ed, “chlamyopsin-3” was de- tected in a data bank of DNA sequences from Chlamydomonas , produced at the research center in Kazusa, Japan, and showed similarities to bacteriorhodopsin. This made it an interesting can- didate for the long-sought rhodopsin in Chlamydomonas . Peter requested the DNA from Japan, and I then expressed it in oo- cytes. Our initial experiments, however, were disappointing be- cause removal or addition of calcium to the oocyte bath solution made no difference to the light-activated electrical current, as would be expected if it actually were a Ca 2 \u0003 permeable channel. The photocurrent itself was rather weak and did not seem to be inﬂ uenced by any change in the ionic concentrations in the bath solution. As I still liked the idea of a directly light-gated ion channel, which most other researchers in the ﬁ eld rejected, I continued to test different bath solutions. One evening, I got a stunningly large inward light-activated current with a solution designed to inhibit calcium currents. It turned out, however, that the solu- tion I used was badly buffered; in fact, it was quite acidic with too much H \u0003 ! But this was a breakthrough as I now had good evidence for an inward-directed light-dependent H \u0003 conduc- tance. Then, by acidifying the oocyte (that is, increasing the H \u0003 concentration of the oocyte interior relative to the out- side), I found I was able to reliably generate outward-directed light-activated currents as well. It soon became clear that we have with chlamyrhodopsin–3 a light-gated proton channel ; therefore, I proposed to my colleagues Peter Hegemann and Ernst Bamberg to call this new protein channelrhodopsin-1. Further experiments revealed that other monovalent cations can also permeate channelrhodopsin-1. The small photocur- rents we observed initially are now understood to be due to poor expression of channelrhodopsin-1 in oocytes. Tantalized by this new ﬁ nding, we prepared a manuscript (published in 2002) and applied for a patent describing the use of light-gated ion channels for noninvasive manipulation of cells and even living organisms. I next studied the closely related algal protein channelrhodopsin-2, and everything be- came so much easier as photocurrents were now really large and easy to analyze.

During this relative refractory period , the amount of current required to depolar- ize the neuron to action potential threshold is elevated above normal. Optogenetics: Controlling Neural Activity with Light. As we have dis- cussed, action potentials are caused by the depolarization of the membrane beyond a threshold value, as occurs naturally in neurons by the opening of ion channels that allow Na \u0003 to cross the membrane. To artiﬁ cially control neuronal ﬁ ring rates, neuroscientists historically have had to use microelectrodes to inject electrical current. This limitation was  recently overcome with a revolutionary new approach called optogenetics , which introduces into neurons foreign genes that express membrane ion chan- nels that open in response to light. \n87 CHAPTER 4 THE ACTION POTENTIAL acids long in its native form, could be shortened to 310 amino acids and attached to yellow ﬂ uorescent protein (YFP) to allow visualization of protein expression. After we published the superior features of chop2 in 2003, requests for the DNA started coming in, and we ourselves looked for collaborations with neurobiologists. One of our ﬁ rst “victims” was Alexander Gottschalk at the nearby University of Frankfurt, as he worked with the small translucent nematode worm Caenorhabditis el- egans (C. elegans) . Unfortunately, I made an error in preparing the DNA such that that the worms, although nicely labeled by YFP, did not react to light. Once I realized my mistake and got chop2–YFP into C. elegans muscle cells, we were amazed how easily these little worms could be induced to contract simply by illumination with blue light. At about the same time (April 2004) Karl Deisseroth at Stanford University asked for the DNA and advice on its use in a collaboration, which I happily accepted. Karl quickly demonstrated the power of channel- rhodopsin-2 in mammalian neurons. His exciting work with Ed Boyden and Feng Zhang attracted a lot of attention, prompting many  requests for the DNA to express this protein in the brain. Many col- leagues from Europe only then realized that chan- nelrhodopsins were ﬁ rst characterized in Frankfurt. The success and ease of application of channelrhodopsin-2 led Karl and Alexander to won- der if there are other rhodopsins that might be used for light-induced inhibition of neuronal activity. We told them about bacteriorhodopsin and halorho- dopsin, the light-activated proton export and chlo- ride import pumps, respectively. Both pumps render the cell interior more negative (i.e., they are light-ac- tivated hyperpolarizers). We recommended halorho- dopsin from the microbe Natronomonas pharaonis as a light-activated hyperpolarizer. We took advan- tage of what we had learned back in 1996: that halorhodopsin had a high afﬁ nity for chloride and that its expression was stable in animal cells. As it turned out, light activation of the chloride pump halorhodopsin is sufﬁ cient to inhibit action potential ﬁ ring in mammalian neurons and to inhibit muscle contraction of the nematode C. elegans . Ironically, these neurobiological exper- iments with halorhodopsin (and the same applies for bacteri- orhodopsin) could have been done several years earlier, but only the discovery and application of channelrhodopsin-2 en- couraged their use and helped create a new ﬁ eld, now called optogenetics. Many neurobiologists are now using these tools, and a few groups, including ourselves, are engaged in further improving and expanding the existing optogenetic tool box.

In Chapter 9, we will discuss how light energy is absorbed by proteins called photopigments to generate the neural responses in our retinas that ultimately give us sight. Of course, sensitivity to light is a property of many organisms. In the course of studying light responses in a green alga, researchers working in Frankfurt, Germany, characterized a photo- pigment they called channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) . By introducing the ChR2 gene into mammalian cells, they showed that it encodes a light- sensitive cation channel that is permeable to Na \u0003 and Ca 2 \u0003 (Box 4.2). The channel opens rapidly in response to blue light, and in neurons the inward ﬂ ow of cations is sufﬁ cient to produce depolarization beyond threshold for action potentials. The enormous potential of optogenet- ics was subsequently demonstrated by researchers in the United States who showed that the behavior of rats and mice could be dramatically inﬂ uenced by shining blue light onto neurons in which the ChR2 gene \n88 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS was introduced (Figure 4.4). Newer additions to the “optogenetic toolkit” available to researchers include halorhodopsin, a protein derived from single-cell microbes that will inhibit neurons in response to yellow light. Understanding how behaviors arise, of course, requires understanding how action potentials arise and propagate through the nervous system. We now take a look at how the movement of ions through the neuron’s own specialized protein channels causes a neural signal with these inter- esting properties. THE ACTION POTENTIAL, IN THEORY The action potential is a dramatic redistribution of electrical charge across the membrane. Depolarization of the cell during the action potential is caused by the inﬂ ux of sodium ions across the membrane, and repolarization is caused by the efﬂ ux of potassium ions . Let’s apply some of the concepts in- troduced in Chapter 3 to help us understand how ions are driven across the membrane, and how these ionic movements affect the membrane potential. Membrane Currents and Conductances Consider the idealized neuron illustrated in Figure 4.5. The membrane of this cell has three types of protein molecules: sodium-potassium pumps, potassium channels, and sodium channels. The pumps work continuously to establish and maintain concentration gradients. As in all our previous examples, we’ll assume that K \u0003 is concentrated twentyfold inside the cell and that Na \u0003 is concentrated tenfold outside the cell. According to the Nernst equation, at 37°C, E K \u0004 \u0002 80 mV and E Na \u0004 62 mV. Let’s use this cell to explore the factors that govern the movement of ions across the membrane. We begin by assuming that both the potassium channels and the sodium channels are closed, and that the membrane potential, V m , is equal to 0 mV (Figure 4.5a). Now let’s open the potassium channels only (Figure 4.5b). As we learned in Chapter 3, K \u0003 will ﬂ ow out of the cell, down the concentration gradient, until the inside becomes negatively charged, and V m \u0004 E K (Figure 4.5c). Here we want to focus our attention on the movement of K \u0003 that took the membrane potential from 0 mV to \u0002 80 mV. Consider these three points: 1. The net movement of K \u0003 across the membrane is an electrical current. We can represent this current using the symbol I K . 2. The number of open potassium channels is proportional to an electrical conductance. We can represent this conductance by the symbol g K . 3. Membrane potassium current, I K , will ﬂ ow only as long as V m \u0002 E K . The driving force on K \u0003 is deﬁ ned as the difference between the real mem- brane potential and the equilibrium potential, which can be written as V m \u0002 E K . There is a simple relationship between the ionic driving force, ionic conductance, and the amount of ionic current that will ﬂ ow. For K \u0003 , this may be written: I K \u0004 g K (V m \u0002 E K ). More generally, we write: I ion \u0004 g ion (V m \u0002 E ion ). If this sounds familiar, that is because it is simply an expression of Ohm’s law, I \u0004 gV, which we learned about in Chapter 3.

Here is an idealized neuron with sodium- potassium pumps (not shown), potassium channels, and sodium channels. The pumps establish ionic concentration gradients so that K \u0003 is concentrated inside the cell and Na \u0003 is concentrated outside the cell. (a) Initially, we assume that all channels are closed and the membrane potential equals 0 mV. (b) Now we open the potassium channels, and K \u0003 flows out of the cell. This movement of K \u0003 is an electrical current, I K , and it flows as long as the membrane conductance to K \u0003 , g K , is greater than zero, and the membrane potential is not equal to the potassium equilibrium potential. (c) At equilib- rium, there is no net potassium current because, although g K \u0005 0, the membrane poten- tial at equilibrium equals E K . At equilibrium, an equal number of K \u0003 enters and leaves. Now let’s take another look at our example. Initially we began with V m \u0004 0 mV and no ionic membrane permeability (see Figure 4.5a). There is a large driving force on K \u0003 because V m \u0002 E K ; in fact, (V m \u0002 E K ) \u0004 80 mV. However, because the membrane is impermeable to K \u0003 , the potassium conductance, g K , equals zero. Consequently, I K \u0004 0. Potassium current ﬂ ows only when the membrane has open potassium channels and  therefore g K \u0005 0. Now K \u0003 ﬂ ows out of the cell—as long as the mem- brane potential differs from the potassium equilibrium potential (see \n90 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS Figure 4.5b). Notice that the current ﬂ ow is in the direction that takes V m toward E K . When V m \u0004 E K , the membrane is at equilibrium, and no net current will ﬂ ow. In this condition, although there is a large potas- sium conductance, g K , there is no longer any net driving force on the K \u0003 (Figure 4.5c). The Ins and Outs of an Action Potential Let’s pick up the action where we left off in the last section. The mem- brane of our ideal neuron is permeable only to K \u0003 , and V m \u0004 E K \u0004 \u0002 80 mV. What’s happening with the Na \u0003 concentrated outside the cell? Because the membrane potential is so negative relative to the sodium equilibrium potential, there is a very large driving force on Na \u0003 ([V m \u0002 E Na ] \u0004 [ \u0002 80 mV \u0002 62 mV] \u0004 \u0002 142 mV). Nonetheless, there can be no net Na \u0003 current as long as the membrane is impermeable to Na \u0003 . But now let’s open the so- dium channels and see what happens to the membrane potential. At the instant we change the ionic permeability of the membrane, g Na is high, and, as we discussed earlier, there is a large driving force pushing on Na \u0003 . Thus, we have what it takes to generate a large sodium current, I Na , across the membrane. Na \u0003 passes through the membrane sodium channels in the direction that takes V m toward E Na ; in this case, the sodium current, I Na , is inward across the membrane. Assuming the membrane permeability is now far greater to sodium than it is to potas- sium, this inﬂ ux of Na \u0003 depolarizes the neuron until V m approaches E Na , 62 mV. Notice that something remarkable happened here. Simply by switch- ing the dominant membrane permeability from K \u0003 to Na \u0003 , we were able to rapidly reverse the membrane potential. In theory, then, the rising phase of the action potential could be explained if, in response to depolar- ization of the membrane beyond threshold, membrane sodium channels opened. This would allow Na \u0003 to enter the neuron, causing a massive depolarization until the membrane potential approached E Na . How could we account for the falling phase of the action potential? Simply assume that sodium channels quickly close and the potassium channels remain open, so the dominant membrane ion permeability switches back from Na \u0003 to K \u0003 . Then K \u0003 would ﬂ ow out of the cell until the membrane potential again equals E K . Our model for the ins and outs, ups and downs of the action potential in an idealized neuron is shown in Figure 4.6. The rising phase of the action potential is explained by an inward sodium current, and the falling phase is explained by an outward potassium current. The action potential therefore could be accounted for simply by the movement of ions through channels that are gated by changes in the membrane potential. If you understand this concept, you understand a lot about the ionic basis of the action potential. What’s left now is to see how this actually happens—in a real neuron. THE ACTION POTENTIAL, IN REALITY Let’s quickly review our theory of the action potential. When the mem- brane is depolarized to threshold, there is a transient increase in g Na . The increase in g Na allows the entry of Na \u0003 , which depolarizes the neuron. And the increase in g Na must be brief in duration to account for the short duration of the action potential. Restoring the negative membrane poten- tial would be further aided by a transient increase in g K during the falling phase, allowing K \u0003 to leave the depolarized neuron faster.

(c) Now we close the sodium channels so that g K \u0005\u0005 g Na . Because the membrane potential is positive, there is a large driving force on K \u0003 .

All one has to do is measure the sodium and potassium conductances of the membrane during the action potential. In practice, however, such a measurement proved to be quite difﬁ cult in real neurons. The key technical break- through came with a device called a voltage clamp , invented by the American physiologist Kenneth C. Cole and used in decisive experiments performed by Cambridge University physiologists Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley around 1950. The voltage clamp enabled Hodgkin and Huxley to “clamp” the membrane potential of an axon at any value they chose. They could then deduce the changes in membrane conductance that occur at different membrane potentials by measuring the currents that ﬂ owed across the membrane. In an elegant series of experiments, Hodgkin and Huxley showed that the rising phase of the action potential was indeed caused by a transient increase in g Na and an inﬂ ux of Na \u0003 , and that the falling phase was associated with an increase in g K and an efﬂ ux of K \u0003 . Their accomplishments were recognized with the Nobel Prize in 1963. To account for the transient changes in g Na , Hodgkin and Huxley pro- posed the existence of sodium “gates” in the axonal membrane. They hypothesized that these gates are “activated” (opened) by depolarization above threshold and “inactivated” (closed and locked) when the membrane acquires a positive membrane potential. These gates are “deinactivated” (unlocked and enabled to be opened again) only after the membrane potential returns to a negative value. It is a tribute to Hodgkin and Huxley that their hypotheses about mem- brane gates came more than 20 years before the direct demonstration of voltage-gated channel proteins in the neuronal membrane. We have a new understanding of gated membrane channels, thanks to two more recent scientiﬁ c breakthroughs. First, new molecular biological techniques have enabled neuroscientists to determine the detailed structure of these pro- teins. Second, new neurophysiological techniques have enabled neurosci- entists to measure the ionic currents that pass through single channels. We will now explore the action potential from the perspective of these membrane ion channels. The Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel The voltage-gated sodium channel is aptly named. The protein forms a pore in the membrane that is highly selective to Na \u0003 , and the pore is opened and closed by changes in membrane voltage. Sodium Channel Structure. The voltage-gated sodium channel is created from a single long polypeptide. The molecule has four distinct domains, numbered I–IV; each domain consists of six transmembrane alpha he- lices, numbered S1–S6 (Figure 4.7). The four domains clump together to form a pore between them. The pore is closed at the negative resting membrane potential. When the membrane is depolarized to threshold, however, the molecule twists into a conﬁ guration that allows the passage of Na \u0003 through the pore (Figure 4.8). Like the potassium channel, the sodium channel has pore loops that are assembled into a selectivity ﬁ lter. This ﬁ lter makes the sodium chan- nel twelve times more permeable to Na \u0003 than it is to K \u0003 . Apparently, the Na \u0003 ions are stripped of most, but not all, of their associated water molecules as they pass into the channel. The retained water serves as a sort of molecular chaperone for the ion, and is necessary for the ion to pass the selectivity ﬁ lter. The ion–water complex can then be used to select Na \u0003 and exclude K \u0003 (Figure 4.9). \n93 CHAPTER 4 THE ACTION POTENTIAL + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + (a) (b) (c) S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 Inside cell N C Outside cell I II III IV Pore loop Gate Voltage sensor Selectivity filter ▲ FIGURE 4.7 The structure of the voltage-gated sodium channel.

(c) A view of the molecule showing how the domains may arrange themselves to form a pore between them. (Source: Adapted from Armstrong and Hille, 1998, Fig. 1.) \n94 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS The sodium channel is gated by a change in voltage across the membrane. It has now been established that the voltage sensor resides in segment S4 of the molecule. In this segment, positively charged amino acid residues are regularly spaced along the coils of the helix. Thus, the entire segment can be forced to move by changing the membrane poten- tial. Depolarization twists S4, and this conformational change in the molecule causes the gate to open. Functional Properties of the Sodium Channel. Research performed around 1980 at the Max Planck Institute in Goettingen, Germany, revealed the func- tional properties of the voltage-gated sodium channel. A new method was used, called the patch clamp , to study the ionic currents passing through individual ion channels (Box 4.3). The patch-clamp method entails sealing the tip of an electrode to a very small patch of neuronal membrane. This patch can then be torn away from the neuron, and the ionic currents across it can be measured as the membrane potential is clamped at any value the experimenter selects. With luck, the patch will contain only a single channel, and the behavior of this channel can be studied. Patch clamping enabled in- vestigation of the functional properties of the voltage-gated sodium channel. Changing the membrane potential of a patch of axonal membrane from \u0002 80 to \u0002 65 mV has little effect on the voltage-gated sodium channels. They remain closed because depolarization of the membrane has not yet reached threshold. Changing the membrane potential from \u0002 65 to \u0002 40 mV, however, causes these channels to pop open. As shown in Figure 4.10, voltage-gated sodium channels have a characteristic pattern of behavior: 1. They open with little delay. 2. They stay open for about 1 msec and then close (inactivate). 3. They cannot be opened again by depolarization until the membrane potential returns to a negative value near threshold. A hypothetical model for how conformational changes in the voltage- gated sodium channel could account for these properties is illustrated in Figure 4.10c. A single channel does not an action potential make. The membrane of an axon may contain thousands of sodium channels per square micrometer ( \u0006 m 2 ), and the concerted action of all these channels is required to gener- ate what we measure as an action potential. Nonetheless, it is interesting to see how many of the properties of the action potential can be explained by the properties of the voltage-gated sodium channel. For example, the fact that single channels do not open until a critical level of membrane depolarization is reached explains the action potential threshold. The rapid opening of the channels in response to depolarization explains why the rising phase of the action potential occurs so quickly.

Water accompanies the ions as they pass through the channel. Hydrated Na \u0003 fits; hydrated K \u0003 does not. (Source: Adapted from Hille, 1992, Figs. 5, 6.) \n95 CHAPTER 4 THE ACTION POTENTIAL time the channels stay open before inactivating (about 1 msec) partly explains why the action potential is so brief. Furthermore, inactivation of the channels can account for the absolute refractory period: Another action potential cannot be generated until the channels are  activated. There are several different sodium channel genes in the human genome. Differences in the expression of these genes among neurons can give rise to subtle but important variations in the properties of the action potential. BOX 4.3 The Patch-Clamp Method T he very existence of voltage-gated channels in the neu- ronal membrane was mere conjecture until methods were developed to study individual channel proteins. A revolu- tionary new method, the patch clamp, was developed by German neuroscientists Bert Sakmann and Erwin Neher in the mid-1970s. In recognition of their contribution, Sakmann and Neher were awarded the 1991 Nobel Prize. Patch clamping enables one to record ionic currents through single channels (Figure A). The ﬁ rst step is gently lowering the ﬁ re-polished tip of a glass recording electrode, 1–5 \u0006 m in diameter, onto the membrane of the neuron (part a), and then applying suction within the electrode tip (part b). A tight seal forms between the walls of the electrode and the underlying patch of membrane. This “gigaohm” seal (so named because of its high electrical resistance: \u0005 10 9 \u0007 ) leaves the ions in the electrode only one path to take, through the  channels in the underlying patch of membrane. If the electrode is then withdrawn from the cell, the membrane patch can be torn away (part c), and ionic currents can be measured as steady voltages are applied across the mem- brane (part d). With a little luck, one can resolve currents ﬂ owing through single channels. If the patch contains a voltage-gated sodium channel, for example, then changing the membrane potential from \u0002 65 to \u0002 40 mV will cause the channel to open, and current (I) will ﬂ ow through it (part e). The amplitude of the measured current at a constant membrane voltage reﬂ ects the channel conductance, and the duration of the current reﬂ ects the time the channel is open. Patch-clamp recordings reveal that most channels ﬂ ip between two conductance states that can be interpreted as open or closed. The time they remain open can vary, but the single-channel conductance value stays the same and is therefore said to be unitary. Ions can pass through single chan- nels at an astonishing rate—well over a million per second.

Epileptic seizures result from explosive, highly synchronous electrical activity in the brain. (Epilepsy is discussed in detail in Chapter 19.) The seizures in this disorder occur in response to fever ( febrile is from the Latin word for “fever”). They usually occur only in early childhood, between 3 months and 5 years of age. Although precisely how the seizures are triggered by an increase in brain temperature is not clear, the  mutations’ effects include slowing the inacti- vation of the sodium channel, prolonging the action potential. Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures is a channelopathy , a human genetic disease caused by alterations in the structure and function of ion  channels. The Effects of Toxins on the Sodium Channel. Researchers at Duke University discovered in the 1960s that a toxin isolated from the ovaries of the puffer ﬁ sh (Figure 4.11) could selectively block the sodium channel. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) clogs the Na \u0003 -permeable pore by binding tightly to a speciﬁ c site on the outside of the channel. TTX blocks all sodium- dependent action potentials and therefore is usually fatal if ingested. Nonetheless, puffer ﬁ sh are considered a delicacy in Japan. Sushi chefs licensed by the government train for years to prepare puffer ﬁ sh in such a way that eating them causes only numbness around the mouth. Talk about adventuresome eating!

(a) This trace shows the electrical potential across a patch of membrane. When the membrane potential is changed from \u0002 65 to \u0002 40 mV, the sodium channels pop open. (b) These traces show how three different channels respond to the voltage step. Each line is a record of the electrical current that flows through a single channel. ➀ At \u0002 65 mV, the channels are closed, so there is no cur- rent. ➁ When the membrane is depolarized to \u0002 40 mV, the channels briefly open and current flows inward, represented by the downward deflection in the current traces. Although there is some variability from chan- nel to channel, all of them open with little delay and stay open for less than 1 msec. Notice that after they have opened once, they close and stay closed as long as the membrane is maintained at a depolarized V m . ➂ The closure of the sodium channel by steady depolarization is called inactivation. ➃ To deinactivate the channels, the mem- brane must be returned to \u0002 65 mV again. (c) A model for how changes in the confor- mation of the sodium channel protein might yield its functional properties. ➀ The closed channel ➁ opens upon membrane depolar- ization. ➂ Inactivation occurs when a globular portion of the protein swings up and occludes the pore. ➃ Deinactivation occurs when the globular portion swings away and the pore closes by movement of the trans- membrane domains. \n97 CHAPTER 4 THE ACTION POTENTIAL TTX is one of a number of natural toxins that interfere with the func- tion of the voltage-gated sodium channel. Another channel-blocking toxin is saxitoxin , produced by dinoﬂ agellates of the genus Gonyaulax . Saxitoxin is concentrated in clams, mussels, and other shellﬁ sh that feed on these marine protozoa. Occasionally the dinoﬂ agellates bloom, causing what is known as a “red tide.” Eating shellﬁ sh at these times can be fatal because of the unusually high concentration of the toxin. In addition to the toxins that block sodium channels, certain com- pounds interfere with nervous system function by causing the channels to open inappropriately. In this category is batrachotoxin , isolated from the skin of a species of Colombian frog. Batrachotoxin causes the channels to open at more negative potentials and to stay open much longer than usual, thus scrambling the information encoded by the action potentials. Toxins produced by lilies ( veratridine ) and buttercups ( aconitine ) have a similar mechanism of action. Sodium channel inactivation is also dis- rupted by toxins from scorpions and sea anemones. What can we learn from these toxins? First, the different toxins disrupt channel function by binding to different sites on the protein. Information about toxin binding and its consequences have helped researchers deduce the three-dimensional structure of the sodium channel. Second, the toxins can be used as experimental tools to study the consequences of blocking action potentials. For example, as we shall see in later chapters, TTX is commonly used in experiments that require blocking impulses in a nerve or muscle. The third and most important lesson from studying toxins? Be careful what you put in your mouth! Voltage-Gated Potassium Channels Hodgkin’s and Huxley’s experiments indicated that the falling phase of the action potential was explained only partly by the inactivation of g Na . ▲ FIGURE 4.11 The puffer fish, source of TTX. (Source: Courtesy of Dr. Toshio Narahashi, Duke University.) \n98 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS They found there was also a transient increase in g K that functioned to speed the restoration of a negative membrane potential after the spike. They proposed the existence of membrane potassium gates that, like sodium gates, open in response to depolarization of the membrane. Unlike sodium gates, however, potassium gates do not open immediately upon depolarization; it takes about 1 msec for them to open. Because of this delay, and because this potassium conductance serves to rectify, or reset, the membrane potential, they called this conductance the delayed rectiﬁ er . We now know that there are many different types of voltage-gated potassium channels . Most of them open when the membrane is depo- larized and function to diminish any further depolarization by giving K \u0003 a path to leave the cell across the membrane. The known voltage-gated potassium channels have a similar structure. The channel proteins con- sist of four separate polypeptide subunits that come together to form a pore between them. Like the sodium channel, these proteins are sensitive to changes in the electrical ﬁ eld across the membrane. When the mem- brane is depolarized, the subunits are believed to twist into a shape that allows K \u0003 to pass through the pore. Putting the Pieces Together We can now use what we’ve learned about ions and channels to explain the key properties of the action potential (Figure 4.12): • Threshold . Threshold is the membrane potential at which enough voltage-gated sodium channels open so that the relative ionic perme- ability of the membrane favors sodium over potassium. • Rising phase . When the inside of the membrane has a negative elec- trical potential, there is a large driving force on Na \u0003 . Therefore, Na \u0003 rushes into the cell through the open sodium channels, causing the membrane to rapidly depolarize. • Overshoot . Because the relative permeability of the membrane greatly favors sodium, the membrane potential goes to a value close to E Na , which is greater than 0 mV. • Falling phase . The behavior of two types of channels contributes to the falling phase. First, the voltage-gated sodium channels inactivate. Second, the voltage-gated potassium channels ﬁ nally open (triggered to do so 1 msec earlier by the depolarization of the membrane). There is a great driving force on K \u0003 when the membrane is strongly depolar- ized. Therefore, K \u0003 rushes out of the cell through the open channels, causing the membrane potential to become negative again. • Undershoot . The open voltage-gated potassium channels add to the resting potassium membrane permeability. Because there is very little sodium permeability, the membrane potential goes toward E K , causing a hyperpolarization relative to the resting membrane potential until the voltage-gated potassium channels close again. • Absolute refractory period . Sodium channels inactivate when the mem- brane becomes strongly depolarized. They cannot be activated again, and another action potential cannot be generated, until the membrane potential becomes sufﬁ ciently negative to deinactivate the channels. • Relative refractory period . The membrane potential stays hyperpolarized until the voltage-gated potassium channels close. Therefore, more depo- larizing current is required to bring the membrane potential to threshold. We’ve seen that channels and the movement of ions through them can explain the properties of the action potential. But it is important to remember that the sodium-potassium pump also is working quietly in the background. Imagine that the entry of Na \u0003 during each action potential is \n99 CHAPTER 4 THE ACTION POTENTIAL (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) Currents through voltage-gated sodium channels Currents through voltage-gated potassium channels Summed K + current through all channels Summed Na + current through all channels K + efflux Na + influx Net transmembrane current Inward current Na + influx K + efflux Outward current Outward current Inward current FIGURE 4.12 The molecular basis of the action potential. (a) The mem- brane potential as it changes in time during an action potential. The rising phase of the action potential is caused by the influx of Na \u0003 through hundreds of voltage-gated sodium channels. The falling phase is caused by sodium channel inactivation and the efflux of K \u0003 through voltage-gated potassium channels. (b) The inward currents through three representative voltage- gated sodium channels. Each channel opens with little delay when the membrane is depolarized to threshold.

The high potassium permeability causes the membrane to hyperpolarize briefly.

(f) The net transmembrane current during the action potential (the sum of parts c and e). like a wave coming over the bow of a boat making way in heavy seas. Like the continuous action of the boat’s bilge pump, the sodium-potassium pump works all the time to transport Na \u0003 back across the membrane. The pump maintains the ionic concentration gradients that drive Na \u0003 and K \u0003 through their channels during the action potential. \n100 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS ACTION POTENTIAL CONDUCTION To transfer information from one point to another in the nervous system, it is necessary that the action potential, once generated, be conducted down the axon. This process is like the burning of a fuse. Imagine you’re holding a ﬁ recracker with a burning match held under the end of the fuse. The fuse ignites when it gets hot enough (beyond some threshold). The tip of the burning fuse heats up the segment of fuse immediately ahead of it until it ignites. In this way, the ﬂ ame steadily works its way down the fuse. Note that the fuse lit at one end only burns in one direction; the ﬂ ame cannot turn back on itself because the combustible material just behind it is spent. Propagation of the action potential along the axon is similar to the propagation of the ﬂ ame along the fuse. When a patch of axonal membrane is depolarized sufﬁ ciently to reach threshold, voltage-gated sodium channels pop open, and the action potential is initiated. The inﬂ ux of positive charge spreads inside the axon to depolarize the adja- cent segment of membrane, and when it reaches threshold, the sodium channels in this patch of membrane also pop open (Figure 4.13). In this way, the action potential works its way down the axon until it reaches the axon terminal, thereby initiating synaptic transmission (the subject of Chapter 5). An action potential initiated at one end of an axon propagates only in one direction; it does not turn back on itself. This is because the mem- brane just behind it is refractory, due to inactivation of the sodium channels. Normally, action potentials conduct only in one direction, from the soma to the axon terminal; this is called orthodromic conduction. But, just like the fuse, an action potential can be generated by depolarization at either end of the axon and can therefore propagate in either direction. Backward propagation, elicited experimentally, is called antidromic con- duction. Note that because the axonal membrane is excitable (capable of generating action potentials) along its entire length, the impulse will A C T I O N P O TE NT IA L C O N D UC T I O N + + + + + + + + + + + + Time zero 1 msec later 2 msec later 3 msec later ▲ FIGURE 4.13 Action potential conduction. The entry of positive charge during the action po- tential causes the membrane just ahead to depolarize to threshold. \n101 CHAPTER 4 THE ACTION POTENTIAL propagate without decrement. The fuse works the same way because it is combustible along its entire length. Unlike the fuse, however, the axon can regenerate its ﬁ ring ability. Action potential conduction velocities vary, but 10 m/sec is a typical rate. Remember, from start to ﬁ nish the action potential lasts about 2 msec. From this, we can calculate the length of membrane that is en- gaged in the action potential at any instant in time: 10 m/sec \b 2 \b 10 \u0002 3 sec \u0004 2 \b 10 \u0002 2 m. Therefore, an action potential traveling at 10 m/sec occurs over a 2 cm length of axon. Factors Inﬂ uencing Conduction Velocity Remember that the inward Na \u0003 current during the action potential depo- larizes the membrane just ahead. When this patch of membrane reaches threshold, the voltage-gated sodium channels will open, and the action potential will “burn” on down the membrane. The speed with which the action potential propagates down the axon depends on how far the depo- larization ahead of the action potential spreads, which in turn depends on certain physical characteristics of the axon. Imagine that the inﬂ ux of positive charge into an axon during the ac- tion potential is like turning on the water to a leaky garden hose. There are two paths the water can take: one, down the inside of the hose; the other, through the perforated wall of the hose. How much water goes along each path depends on their relative resistance; most of the water will take the path of least resistance. If the hose is narrow and the leaks are numerous and large, most of the water will ﬂ ow out through the leaks. If the hose is wide and the leaks are few and tiny, most of the water will ﬂ ow down the inside of the hose. The same principles apply to positive current spreading down the axon ahead of the action potential. There are two paths that positive charge can take: down the inside of the axon, or across the axonal membrane. If the axon is narrow and there are many open membrane pores, most of the current will ﬂ ow out across the membrane. If the axon is wide and there are few open membrane pores, most of the current will ﬂ ow down inside the axon. The farther the current goes down the axon, the farther ahead of the action potential the membrane will be depolarized, and the faster the action potential will propagate. As a rule, therefore, action potential conduction velocity increases with increasing axonal diameter. As a consequence of this relationship between axonal diameter and conduction velocity, neural pathways that are especially important for survival have evolved unusually large axons. An example is the giant axon of the squid, which is part of a pathway that mediates an escape reﬂ ex in response to strong sensory stimulation. The squid giant axon can be 1 mm in diameter, so large that originally it was thought to be part of the animal’s circulatory system. Neuroscience owes a debt to British zoologist J. Z. Young, who in 1939 called attention to the squid giant axon as an experimental preparation for studying the biophysics of the neuro- nal membrane. Hodgkin and Huxley used this preparation to elucidate the ionic basis of the action potential, and the giant axon continues to be used today in a wide range of neurobiological studies. It is interesting to note that axonal size and the number of  voltage-gated channels in the membrane also affect axonal excitability. Smaller axons require greater depolarization to reach action potential threshold and are more sensitive to being blocked by local anesthetics (Box 4.4). \n102 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS O F  S P E C I A L  I N T E R E S T BOX 4.4 Local Anesthesia A lthough you’ve tried to tough it out, you just can’t take it anymore. You ﬁ nally give in to the pain of the toothache and head for the dentist. Fortunately, the worst part of having a cavity ﬁ lled is the pinprick in the gum caused by the injection needle. Then your mouth becomes numb and you daydream while the dentist drills and repairs your tooth. What was in- jected, and how did it work? Local anesthetics are drugs that temporarily block action potentials in axons. They are called “local” because they are in- jected directly into the tissue where anesthesia—the absence of sensation—is desired. Small axons, ﬁ ring a lot of action poten- tials, are most sensitive to conduction block by local anesthetics. The ﬁ rst local anesthetic introduced into medical  practice was cocaine. The chemical was isolated from the leaves of the coca plant in 1860 by the German physician Albert Niemann. According to the custom of the pharmacologists of his day, Niemann tasted the new compound and discovered that it caused his tongue to go numb. It was soon learned that cocaine also had toxic and addictive properties. (The mind- altering effect of cocaine was studied by another  well-known physician of that era, Sigmund Freud. Cocaine alters mood by a mechanism distinct from its local anesthetic action, as we shall see in Chapter 15.) The search for a suitable synthetic anesthetic as a substi- tute for cocaine led to the development of lidocaine, which is now the most widely used local anesthetic. Lidocaine can be dissolved into a jelly and smeared onto the mucous membranes of the mouth (and elsewhere) to numb the nerve endings (called topical anesthesia) ; it can be injected directly into a tissue ( inﬁ ltration  anesthesia ) or a nerve ( nerve block ); it can even be infused into the cerebrospinal ﬂ uid bathing the spinal cord ( spinal anesthesia ), where it can numb large parts of the body. Lidocaine and other local anesthetics prevent action potentials by binding to the voltage-gated sodium channels. The binding site for lidocaine has been identiﬁ ed as the S6 alpha helix of domain IV of the protein (Figure A). Lidocaine cannot gain access to this site from the outside. The anes- thetic ﬁ rst must cross the axonal membrane and then pass through the open gate of the channel to ﬁ nd its binding site inside the pore. This explains why active nerves are blocked faster (the sodium channel gates are open more often). The bound lidocaine interferes with the ﬂ ow of Na \u0003 that normally results from depolarizing the channel. Smaller axons are affected by local anesthetics before larger axons because their action potentials have less of a safety margin; more of the voltage-gated sodium channels must function to ensure that the action potential doesn’t ﬁ zzle out as it conducts down the axon. This increased  sensitivity of small axons to local anesthetics is fortuitous in clinical practice. As we will discover in Chapter 12, it is the smaller ﬁ bers that convey information about painful stimuli—like a toothache.

If all the axons in your brain were the diameter of a squid giant axon, your head would be too big to ﬁ t through a barn door. Fortunately, verte- brates evolved another solution for increasing action potential conduction velocity: wrapping the axon with insulation called myelin (see Chapter 2). The myelin sheath consists of many layers of membrane provided by glial support cells—Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (outside the brain and spinal cord) and oligodendroglia in the central nervous system. Just as wrapping a leaky garden hose with duct tape facilitates water ﬂ ow down the inside of the hose, myelin facilitates current ﬂ ow down the inside of the axon, thereby increasing action potential conduc- tion velocity (Box 4.5). The myelin sheath does not extend continuously along the entire length of the axon. There are breaks in the insulation where ions cross the membrane to generate action potentials. Recall from Chapter 2 that these breaks in the myelin sheath are the nodes of Ranvier (Figure 4.14). Voltage-gated sodium channels are concentrated in the membrane of the nodes. The distance between nodes is usually 0.2 \u0002 2.0 mm, depending on the size of the axon (fatter axons have larger inter- nodal distances). Imagine that the action potential traveling along the axon membrane is like you traveling down a sidewalk. Action potential conduction with- out myelin is like walking down the sidewalk in small steps, heel-to-toe, using every inch of the sidewalk to creep along. Conduction with  myelin, O F  S P E C I A L  I N T E R E S T BOX 4.5 Multiple Sclerosis, a Demyelinating Disease T he critical importance of myelin for the normal transfer of information in the human nervous system is revealed by the neurological disorder known as multiple sclerosis (MS). Victims of MS often complain of weakness, lack of coordina- tion, and impaired vision and speech. The disease is capri- cious, usually marked by remissions and relapses that occur over a period of many years. Although the precise cause of MS is still poorly understood, the cause of the sensory and motor disturbances is now quite clear. MS attacks the myelin sheaths of bundles of axons in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. The word sclerosis is derived from the Greek word for “hardening,” which describes the lesions that de- velop around bundles of axons, and the sclerosis is multiple because the disease attacks many sites in the nervous sys- tem at the same time. Lesions in the brain can now be viewed noninvasively using new methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, neurologists have been able to diagnose MS for many years by taking advantage of the fact that  myelin serves the nervous system by increasing the velocity of axonal conduction. One simple test involves stimulating the eye with a checkerboard pattern and measuring the elapsed time until an electrical response is noted at the scalp over the part of the brain that is a target of the optic nerve. People who have MS characteristically have a marked slowing of the conduction velocity of their optic nerve. Another demyelinating disease called Guillain–Barré syn- drome attacks the myelin of the  peripheral nerves that inner- vate muscle and skin. This disease may follow minor infec- tious illnesses and inoculations, and it appears to result from an anomalous immunological response against one’s own myelin. The symptoms stem directly from the slowing and/ or failure of action potential conduction in the axons that in- nervate the muscles. This conduction deﬁ cit can be demon- strated clinically by stimulating peripheral nerves electrically through the skin and measuring the time it takes to evoke a response (a twitch of a muscle, for instance). Both MS and Guillain–Barré syndrome are characterized by a profound slowing of the response time because saltatory conduction is disrupted. \n104 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS in contrast, is like skipping down the sidewalk. In myelinated axons, action potentials skip from node to node (Figure 4.15). This type of action potential propagation is called saltatory conduction (from the Latin meaning “to leap”). ACTION POTENTIALS, AXONS, AND DENDRITES Action potentials of the type discussed in this chapter are a feature mainly of axons. As a rule, the membranes of dendrites and neuro- nal cell bodies do not generate sodium-dependent action potentials A C T I O N P O TE NT IA LS , AX O NS , A N D DEN DR ITES Axon Node of Ranvier Myelin sheath ▲ FIGURE 4.14 The myelin sheath and node of Ranvier.

Compare this figure with Figure 4.12. \n105 CHAPTER 4 THE ACTION POTENTIAL because they have very few voltage-gated sodium channels. Only membrane that contains these specialized protein molecules is ca- pable of generating  action potentials, and this type of excitable mem- brane is usually found only in axons. Therefore, the part of the neu- ron where an axon originates from the soma, the axon hillock, is often also called the spike-initiation zone . In a  typical neuron in the brain or spinal cord, the depolarization of the dendrites and soma caused by synaptic input from other neurons leads to the generation of action potentials if the membrane of the axon hillock is depolarized beyond threshold (Figure 4.16a). In most sensory neurons, however, the spike-initiation zone occurs near the sensory nerve endings ,  where the depolarization caused by sensory stimulation leads to the gen- eration of action  potentials that propagate along the sensory nerves (Figure 4.16b). In Chapter 2, we learned that axons and dendrites differ in their morphology. We now see that they are functionally different, and that this difference in function is specified at the molecular level by the type of protein in the neuronal membrane. Differences in the types and density of membrane ion channels can also account for the  characteristic electrical properties of different types of neurons (Box 4.6).

Membrane  proteins specify the function of different parts of the neuron. Depicted here are (a) a  cortical pyramidal neuron and (b) a primary sensory neuron. Despite the diversity of neuronal structure, the axonal membrane can be identified at the molecular level by its high density of voltage-gated sodium channels. This molecular distinction enables axons to generate and conduct action  potentials. The region of membrane where action potentials are normally generated is called the spike-initiation zone. The arrows indicate the normal direction of action  potential propagation in these two types of neuron. \n106 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS O F  S P E C I A L  I N T E R E S T BOX 4.6 The Eclectic Electric Behavior of Neurons N eurons are not all alike; they vary in shape, size, gene expression, and connections. Neurons also differ from one another in their electrical properties. A few examples of the diverse behavior of neurons are shown in Figure A. The cerebral cortex has two major types of neurons as de- ﬁ ned by morphology: aspinous stellate cells and spiny  pyramidal cells. A stellate cell typically responds to a steady depolarizing current injected into its soma by ﬁ ring action  potentials at a relatively steady frequency throughout the  stimulus (part a). However, most pyramidal cells cannot sustain a steady ﬁ ring rate. Instead, they ﬁ re rapidly at the beginning of the stimulus and then slow down, even if the stimulus remains strong (part b). This slowing over time is called adaptation , a very common property among excitable cells. Another ﬁ ring pattern is the burst, a rapid cluster of action potentials followed by a brief pause. Some cells, including a particular subtype of large py- ramidal neuron in the cortex, respond to a steady input with rhythmic, repetitive bursts (part c). Variability of ﬁ ring patterns (a) 25 msec V m Depolarizing injected current (b) 50 msec (c) 50 msec Figure A The diverse behavior of neurons. (Source: Adapted from Agmon and Connors, 1992.) is not unique in the cerebral cortex. Surveys of many areas of the brain suggest that neurons have as large an assortment of electrical behaviors as morphologies. What accounts for the diverse behavior of different types of neurons? Ultimately, each neuron’s physiology is deter- mined by the properties and numbers of ion channels in its membrane. There are many more types of ion channels than the few described in this chapter, and each has distinctive properties. For example, some potassium channels activate only very slowly. A neuron with a high density of these will show adaptation because during a prolonged stimulus, more and more of the slow potassium channels will open, and the outward currents they progressively generate will tend to hyperpolarize the membrane. When you realize that a single neuron may have more than a dozen types of ion channels, the source of diverse ﬁ ring behavior becomes clear. It is the complex interactions among multiple ion channels that create the eclectic electric signature of each class of neuron. \n107 CHAPTER 4 THE ACTION POTENTIAL K E Y  T E R M S Properties of the Action Potential rising phase (p. 82) overshoot (p. 82) falling phase (p. 82) undershoot (p. 82) after-hyperpolarization (p. 82) threshold (p. 84) absolute refractory period (p. 85) relative refractory period (p. 86) optogenetics (p. 86) channelrhodopsin-2, ChR2 (p. 87) The Action Potential, in Reality voltage clamp (p. 92) voltage-gated sodium channel (p. 92) patch clamp (p. 94) channelopathy (p. 96) tetrodotoxin (TTX) (p. 96) voltage-gated potassium channel (p. 98) Action Potential Conduction saltatory conduction (p. 104) Action Potentials, Axons, and Dendrites spike-initiation zone (p. 105) CONCLUDING REMARKS Let’s return brieﬂ y to the example in Chapter 3 of stepping on a thumbtack. The breaking of the skin caused by the tack stretches the sensory nerve endings of the foot. Special ion channels that are sensitive to the stretching of the membrane open and allow positively charged sodium ions to enter the ends of the axons in the skin. This inﬂ ux of positive charge  depolarizes the membrane to threshold, and the action potential is generated. The positive charge that enters during the rising phase of the action potential spreads along the axon and depolarizes the membrane ahead to threshold. In this way, the action potential is continuously regenerated as it sweeps like a wave along the sensory axon. We now come to the step where this information is distributed to and integrated by other neurons in the central nervous system. This transfer of information from one neuron to another is called synaptic transmission , the subject of the next two chapters. It should come as no surprise that synaptic transmission, like the action potential, depends on specialized proteins in the neuronal membrane. Thus, a picture begins to emerge of the brain as a complicated mesh of interacting neuronal membranes. Consider that a typical neuron with all its neurites has a membrane surface area of about 250,000 \u0006 m 2 . The surface area of the 85 billion neurons that make up the human brain comes to 21,250 m 2 — roughly the size of three soccer ﬁ elds. This expanse of membrane, with its myriad specialized protein molecules, constitutes the fabric of our minds. C O N C L U D I NG R E M A R KS 1.

First, specialized ion channels of the sensory nerve endings allow positive charge to enter the axon. If this depolarization reaches threshold, then action potentials are generated. Because the axonal membrane is excitable and has voltage-gated sodium channels, action potentials can propagate with- out decrement up the long sensory nerves. For this information to be pro- cessed by the rest of the nervous system, however, these neural signals must be passed on to other neurons—for example, the motor neurons that control muscle contraction, as well as neurons in the brain and spinal cord that lead to a coordinated reﬂ ex response. By the end of the nineteenth cen- tury, it was recognized that this transfer of information from one neuron to another occurs at specialized sites of contact. In 1897, English physiologist Charles Sherrington gave these sites their name: synapses. The process of information transfer at a synapse is called synaptic transmission . The physical nature of synaptic transmission was debated for almost a century. One attractive hypothesis, which nicely explained the speed of synaptic transmission, was that it was simply electrical current ﬂ owing from one neuron to the next. The existence of such electrical synapses was ﬁ nally proven in the late 1950s by Edwin Furshpan and David Potter, American physiologists who were studying the nervous system of crayﬁ sh at University College London, and Akira Watanabe, who was studying the neurons of lobster at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University. We now know that electrical synapses are common in the brains of invertebrates and vertebrates, including mammals. An alternative hypothesis about the nature of synaptic transmission, also dating back to the 1800s, was that chemical neurotransmitters trans- fer information from one neuron to another at the synapse. Solid support for the concept of chemical synapses was provided in 1921 by Otto Loewi, then the head of the Pharmacology Department at the University of Graz in Austria. Loewi showed that electrical stimulation of axons innervating the frog’s heart caused the release of a chemical that could mimic the effects of neuron stimulation on the heartbeat (Box 5.1). Later, Bernard Katz and his colleagues at University College London conclusively demonstrated that fast transmission at the synapse between a motor neuron axon and skeletal muscle was chemically mediated. By 1951, John Eccles of the Australian National University was studying the physiology of synaptic transmission within the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) using a new tool, the glass microelectrode. These experiments indicated that many CNS syn- apses also use a chemical transmitter; in fact, chemical synapses comprise the majority of synapses in the brain. During the last decade, new methods of studying the molecules involved in synaptic transmission have revealed that synapses are far more complex than most neuroscientists anticipated. Synaptic transmission is a large and fascinating topic. The actions of psy- choactive drugs, the causes of mental disorders, the neural bases of learning and memory—indeed, all the operations of the nervous system—cannot be understood without knowledge of synaptic transmission. Therefore, we’ve devoted several chapters to this topic, mainly focusing on chemical synapses. In this chapter, we begin by exploring the basic mechanisms of synaptic transmission. What do different types of synapse look like? How are neu- rotransmitters synthesized and stored, and how are they released in response to an action potential in the axon terminal? How do neurotransmitters act on the postsynaptic membrane? How do single neurons integrate the inputs provided by the thousands of synapses that impinge upon them? I NT R O D U C TIO N \n111 CHAPTER 5 SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION O F  S P E C I A L  I N T E R E S T BOX 5.1 Otto Loewi’s Dream O ne of the more colorful stories in the history of neuro- science comes from Otto Loewi, who, working in Austria in the 1920s, showed deﬁ nitively that synaptic transmission between nerves and the heart is chemically mediated. The heart has two types of innervation; one type speeds the beating of the heart, and the other slows it. The latter type of innervation is supplied by the vagus nerve. Loewi isolated a frog heart with the vagal innervation still intact, stimulated the nerve electrically, and observed the expected effect: the slowing of the heartbeat. The critical demonstration that this effect was chemically mediated came when he applied the solution that had bathed this heart to a second isolated frog heart and found that the beating of this one also slowed. The idea for this experiment had actually come to Loewi in a dream. Below is his own account: In the night of Easter Sunday, 1921, I awoke, turned on the light, and jotted down a few notes on a tiny slip of paper. Then, I fell asleep again. It occurred to me at six o’clock in the morning that during the night I had written down something most important, but I was unable to deci- pher the scrawl. That Sunday was the most desperate day in my whole scientiﬁ c life. During the next night, however, I awoke again, at three o’clock, and I remembered what it was. This time I did not take any risk; I got up imme- diately, went to the laboratory, made the experiment on the frog’s heart, described above, and at ﬁ ve o’clock the chemical transmission of the nervous impulse was conclu- sively proved. . . Careful consideration in daytime would undoubtedly have rejected the kind of experiment I per- formed, because it would have seemed most unlikely that if a nervous impulse released a transmitting agent, it would do so not just in sufﬁ cient quantity to inﬂ uence the effec- tor organ, in my case the heart, but indeed in such an ex- cess that it could partly escape into the ﬂ uid which ﬁ lled the heart, and could therefore be detected. Yet the whole nocturnal concept of the experiment was based on this eventuality, and the result proved to be positive, contrary to expectation. (Loewi, 1953, pp. 33–34.) The active compound, which Loewi called vagusstoff (literally “vagus substance” in German), turned out to be acetylcholine. As we see in this chapter, acetylcholine is also a transmitter at the synapse between nerve and skeletal muscle. Unlike at the heart, acetylcholine applied to skeletal muscle causes excitation and contraction. TYPES OF SYNAPSES We introduced the synapse in Chapter 2. A synapse is the specialized junction where one part of a neuron contacts and communicates with an- other neuron or cell type (such as a muscle or glandular cell). Information generally ﬂ ows in one direction, from a neuron to its target cell. The ﬁ rst neuron is said to be presynaptic , and the target cell is said to be postsynaptic . Let’s take a closer look at the different types of synapse. Electrical Synapses Electrical synapses are relatively simple in structure and function, and they allow the direct transfer of ionic current from one cell to the next. Electrical synapses occur at specialized sites called gap junctions . Gap junctions occur between cells in nearly every part of the body and interconnect many non-neural cells, including epithelial cells, smooth and cardiac muscle cells, liver cells, some glandular cells, and glia. When gap junctions interconnect neurons, they can function as electri- cal synapses. At a gap junction, the membranes of two cells are separated by only about 3 nm, and this narrow gap is spanned by clusters of special proteins called connexins . There are about 20 different subtypes of con- nexins, about half of which occur in the brain. Six connexin subunits com- bine to form a channel called a connexon , and two connexons (one from each cell) meet and combine to form a gap junction channel (Figure 5.1). The channel allows ions to pass directly from the cytoplasm of one cell T Y P E S O F S Y NA P S ES \n112 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS to the cytoplasm of the other. The pore of most gap junction channels is relatively large. Its diameter is about 1–2 nm, big enough for all the major cellular ions and many small organic molecules to pass through. Most gap junctions allow ionic current to pass equally well in both directions; therefore, unlike the vast majority of chemical synapses, elec- trical synapses are bidirectional. Because electrical current (in the form of ions) can pass through these channels, cells connected by gap junctions are said to be electrically coupled . Transmission at electrical synapses is very fast and, if the synapse is large, nearly fail-safe. Thus, an action potential in the presynaptic neuron can produce, with very little delay, an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron. In invertebrate species, such as the crayﬁ sh, electrical synapses are sometimes found between sensory and motor neurons in neural pathways mediating escape reﬂ exes. This mechanism enables an animal to beat a hasty retreat when faced with a dangerous situation. Studies in recent years have revealed that electrical synapses are common in every part of the mammalian CNS (Figure 5.2a). When two neurons are electrically coupled, an action potential in the presynaptic neuron causes a small amount of ionic current to ﬂ ow across the gap junc- tion channels into the other neuron. This current causes an electrically mediated postsynaptic potential (PSP) in the second neuron (Figure 5.2b). Note that, because most electrical synapses are bidirectional, when that second neuron generates an action potential, it will in turn induce a PSP in the ﬁ rst neuron. The PSP generated by a single electrical syn- apse in the mammalian brain is usually small—about 1 mV or less at its peak—and may not, by itself, be large enough to trigger an action (a) Cell 2 Cell 1 Gap junction Cell 1 cytoplasm Cell 2 cytoplasm Ions and small molecules Channel formed by pores in each membrane (b) (c) 3.5 nm 20 nm Gap junction channels Gap junction Connexon Connexin ▼ FIGURE 5.1 A gap junction.

Ions and small molecules can pass in both directions through these channels. (c) Six connexin subunits comprise one connexon, two connexons comprise one gap junction channel, and many gap junction channels comprise one gap junction. \n113 CHAPTER 5 SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION potential in the postsynaptic cell. One neuron usually makes electrical synapses with many other neurons, however, so several PSPs occurring simultaneously may strongly excite a neuron. This is an example of syn- aptic integration, which is discussed later in the chapter. The precise roles of electrical synapses vary from one brain region to another. They are often found where normal function requires that the activity of neighboring neurons be highly synchronized. For example, neu- rons in a brain stem nucleus called the inferior olive can generate both small oscillations of membrane voltage and, more occasionally, action po- tentials. These cells send axons to the cerebellum and are important in motor control. They also make gap junctions with one another. Current that ﬂ ows through gap junctions during membrane oscillations and ac- tion potentials serves to coordinate and synchronize the activity of inferior olivary neurons (Figure 5.3a), and this in turn may help to control the ﬁ ne timing of motor control. Michael Long and Barry Connors, working at Brown University, found that genetic deletion of a critical gap junction protein called connexin36 (Cx36) did not alter the neurons’ ability to gen- erate oscillations and action potentials but did abolish the synchrony of these events because of the loss of functional gap junctions (Figure 5.3b). Gap junctions between neurons and other cells are particularly com- mon early in development. Evidence suggests that during prenatal and postnatal brain development, gap junctions allow neighboring cells to share both electrical and chemical signals that may help coordinate their growth and maturation. Chemical Synapses Most synaptic transmission in the mature human nervous system is chemical, so the remainder of this chapter and the next will now focus exclusively on chemical synapses.

(Source: Part a from Sloper and Powell, 1978.) \n114 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS chemical synapses, let’s take a look at some of their universal character- istics (Figure 5.4). The presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes at chemical synapses are separated by a synaptic cleft that is 20–50 nm wide, 10 times the width of the separation at gap junctions. The cleft is ﬁ lled with a matrix of ﬁ brous extracellular protein. One function of this matrix is to serve as a “glue” that binds the pre- and postsynaptic membranes together. The presynaptic side of the synapse, also called the presynaptic element , is usually an axon terminal. The terminal typically contains dozens of small membrane-enclosed spheres, each about 50 nm in diameter, called synaptic vesicles (Figure 5.5a). These vesicles store neurotransmitter, the chemical used to communicate with the postsynaptic neuron. Many axon terminals also contain larger vesicles, each about 100 nm in diameter, called secretory granules . Secretory granules contain soluble protein that appears dark in the electron microscope, so they are sometimes called large, dense-core vesicles (Figure 5.5b).

On the presynaptic side, proteins jutting into the cytoplasm of the terminal along the intracellular face of the mem- brane sometimes look like a ﬁ eld of tiny pyramids. The pyramids, and the membrane associated with them, are the actual sites of neurotrans- mitter release, called active zones . Synaptic vesicles are clustered in the cytoplasm adjacent to the active zones (see Figure 5.4). The protein thickly accumulated in and just under the postsynaptic membrane is called the postsynaptic density . The postsynaptic density contains the neurotransmitter receptors, which convert the intercellular chemical signal (i.e., neurotransmitter) into an intracellular signal (i.e., a change in membrane potential or a chemical change) in the postsynaptic cell. As we shall see, the nature of this postsynaptic response can be quite varied, depending on the type of protein receptor that is activated by the neurotransmitter. CNS Chemical Synapses. In the CNS, different types of synapse may be distinguished by which part of the neuron is postsynaptic to the axon terminal. If the postsynaptic membrane is on a dendrite, the synapse is said to be axodendritic . If the postsynaptic membrane is on the cell body, the synapse is said to be axosomatic . In some cases, the postsynaptic membrane is on another axon, and these synapses are called axoaxonic (Figure 5.6). When a presynaptic axon contacts a postsynaptic dendritic spine, it is called axospinous (Figure 5.7a). In certain specialized neu- rons, dendrites actually form synapses with one another; these are called Axon terminal (presynaptic element) Active zone Membrane differentiations Postsynaptic density Receptors Synaptic vesicles Mitochondria Secretory granules Synaptic cleft P o s t s y n a p t i c d e n d r i t e ▲ FIGURE 5.4 The components of a chemical synapse. \n116 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS Mitochondria Active zone Dense-core vesicles Synaptic vesicles (a) (b) Presynaptic terminal Postsynaptic cell ▲ FIGURE 5.5 Chemical synapses, as seen with the electron microscope.

The sizes and shapes of CNS synapses also vary widely (Figure 5.7a-d). The ﬁ nest details of synaptic structure can be studied only under the powerful magniﬁ cation of the electron microscope (Box 5.2). CNS synapses may be further classiﬁ ed into two general categories based on the appearance of their presynaptic and postsynaptic membrane differentiations. Synapses in which the membrane differentiation on the postsynaptic side is thicker than that on the presynaptic side are called asymmetrical synapses , or Gray’s type I synapses ; those in which the mem- brane differentiations are of similar thickness are called symmetrical Postsynaptic elements Presynaptic terminals Active zones Presynaptic terminals Axon Axons Postsynaptic dendritic spine (a) (a) (b) (c) (d) Axon Axon ▲ FIGURE 5.7 Various shapes and sizes of CNS synapses.

Notice that larger synapses have more active zones. \n118 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS T he ﬁ rst time I looked through the microscope and saw a dendritic spine, it was love at ﬁ rst sight, and the affair has simply never ended. I was a graduate student in the new neu- robiology and behavior program at the University of Illinois, and it was indeed an exciting time in neuroscience. The 1979 Society for Neuroscience meeting had only about 5,000 at- tendees (attendance is now about 25,000), and the member number I obtained during my ﬁ rst year of graduate school was and remains 2500. I had hoped to discover what a “learned” dendritic spine looks like by training animals and then using the Golgi stain- ing method to quantify changes in spine number and shape. Eagerly, I developed a high-throughput project, preparing the brains from many rats at once, sectioning through the whole brains, checking that the silver staining had worked, and then storing the tissue sections in butanol while engaging under- graduates to help mount them on microscope slides. To our dismay, we found several months later that all the silver had been dissolved out of the cells. There were no cells to see, and the project died an untimely death. I was fortunate, however, to meet Professor Timothy Teyler at a Gordon Research Conference. He had recently brought the hippocampal slice preparation to the United States from Norway and was moving his lab from Harvard to a new medi- cal school in Rootstown, Ohio. I was completely enamored by the experimental control that brain slices might offer, so I de- veloped a Golgi-slice procedure and moved to complete my PhD with Teyler. This time, I prepared one slice at a time, and as can be seen in Figure A, the spines were exquisitely visible. Unfortunately, accurate counts and shape measurements of the tiny spines were just beyond the resolution of light microscopy. While I was a graduate student, I talked my way into the esteemed summer course in neurobiology at the Marine Biological Laboratories in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. There I ﬁ rst learned serial-section three-dimensional electron microscopy (3DEM). I was truly hooked. With 3DEM, one could reconstruct dendrites, axons, and glia, and not only measure and count dendritic spines but also see where syn- apses formed, what was inside them, and how glia asso- ciated with synapses (Figure B). The 3DEM platform offers enormous possibilities for discovery. My life continues to be devoted to uncovering the processes of synapse formation and plasticity during learning and memory in the brain. Early in my career, while the revolution of molecular biology was sweeping the ﬁ eld, only a rare student or fellow scien- tist shared my enthusiasm for 3DEM. That bias has shifted dramatically as neuroscientists have come to recognize the importance of understanding how molecules work in consort with intracellular organelles in small spaces like dendrites and spines. Furthermore, all maps of neural circuitry must include synapses. These endeavors have drawn scientists from nearly every ﬁ eld, making 3DEM even more exciting as many of the imaging and reconstruction processes previously done man- ually are being automated. Figure C shows a recent 3DEM rendering, with color-coding of organelles and synaptic com- ponents. It is indeed thrilling to be part of this growth. New ﬁ ndings abound regarding the plasticity of synapse structure during normal changes in brain function and as altered by diseases that tragically affect who we are as human beings.

As we shall see later in the chapter, these structural differences reveal functional differences. Gray’s type I synapses are usually excitatory, while Gray’s type II syn- apses are usually inhibitory. The Neuromuscular Junction. Synaptic junctions also exist outside the CNS. For example, axons of the autonomic nervous system innervate glands, smooth muscle, and the heart. Chemical synapses also occur between the axons of motor neurons of the spinal cord and skeletal muscle. Such a synapse is called a neuromuscular junction , and it has many of the structural features of chemical synapses in the CNS (Figure 5.9). Neuromuscular synaptic transmission is fast and reliable. An action potential in the motor axon always causes an action potential in the mus- cle cell it innervates. This reliability is accounted for, in part, by struc- tural specializations of the neuromuscular junction. Its most important specialization is its size—it is one of the largest synapses in the body. The presynaptic terminal also contains a large number of active zones. In  addition, the postsynaptic membrane, also called the motor end- plate , contains a series of shallow folds. The presynaptic active zones are precisely aligned with these junctional folds, and the postsynaptic membrane of the folds is packed with neurotransmitter receptors. This structure ensures that many neurotransmitter molecules are focally released onto a large surface of chemically sensitive membrane. Because neuromuscular junctions are more accessible to researchers than CNS synapses, much of what we know about the mechanisms of synaptic transmission was ﬁ rst established here. Neuromuscular junc- tions are also of considerable clinical signiﬁ cance; diseases, drugs, and poisons that interfere with this chemical synapse have direct effects on vital bodily functions. PRINCIPLES OF CHEMICAL SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION Consider the basic requirements of chemical synaptic transmission. There must be a mechanism for synthesizing neurotransmitter and packing it into the synaptic vesicles, a mechanism for causing vesicles to spill their contents into the synaptic cleft in response to a presynaptic action poten- tial, a mechanism for producing an electrical or biochemical response to neurotransmitter in the postsynaptic neuron, and a mechanism for remov- ing neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft. And, to be useful for sensa- tion, perception, and the control of movement, all these things must often occur very rapidly, within milliseconds. No wonder physiologists were ini- tially skeptical about the existence of chemical synapses in the brain! Fortunately, thanks to several decades of research on the topic, we now understand how many of these aspects of synaptic transmission are so efﬁ ciently carried out. Here we’ll present a general survey of the basic principles. In Chapter 6, we will take a more detailed look at the indi- vidual neurotransmitters and their modes of postsynaptic action. Neurotransmitters Since the discovery of chemical synaptic transmission, researchers have been identifying neurotransmitters in the brain.

The postsynaptic membrane, known as the motor end-plate, contains junctional folds with numerous neurotransmitter receptors. categories: (1) amino acids , (2) amines , and (3) peptides (Table 5.1). Some representatives of these categories are shown in Figure 5.10. The amino acid and amine neurotransmitters are all small organic molecules containing at least one nitrogen atom, and they are stored in and released from synaptic vesicles. Peptide neurotransmitters are large molecules—chains of amino acids—stored in and released from secretory granules. As discussed ear- lier, secretory granules and synaptic vesicles are frequently observed in \n121 CHAPTER 5 SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION TABLE 5.1 The Major Neurotransmitters Amino Acids Amines Peptides Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) Glutamate (Glu) Glycine (Gly) Acetylcholine (ACh) Dopamine (DA) Epinephrine Histamine Norepinephrine (NE) Serotonin (5-HT) Cholecystokinin (CCK) Dynorphin Enkephalins (Enk) N -acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) Neuropeptide Y Somatostatin Substance P Thyrotropin-releasing hormone Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) CH 2 CH COOH NH 2 CH 2 COOH CH 2 CH NH 2 CH 2 COOH CH COOH NH 2 2 Glu GABA Gly Carbon Oxygen Nitrogen Hydrogen Sulfur ACh Substance P NE Arg Pro Lys Pro Gln Gln Phe Phe Gly Leu Met (a) (b) (c) O N + O OH CH 3 CH 2 CH 3 CH 3 CH 3 CH 2 C HO HO CH 2 NH 2 CH ▲ FIGURE 5.10 Representative neurotransmitters.

(For the abbreviations and chemical structures of amino acids in substance P, see Figure 3.4b.) \n122 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS the same axon terminals. Consistent with this observation, peptides often exist in the same axon terminals that contain amine or amino acid neu- rotransmitters. As we’ll discuss in a moment, these different neurotrans- mitters are released under different conditions. Different neurons in the brain release different neurotransmitters. The speed of synaptic transmission varies widely. Fast forms of synaptic transmission last from about 10–100 msec, and at most CNS synapses are mediated by the amino acids glutamate (Glu) , gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) , or glycine (Gly) . The amine acetylcholine (ACh) medi- ates fast synaptic transmission at all neuromuscular junctions. Slower forms of synaptic transmission may last from hundreds of milliseconds to minutes; they can occur in the CNS and in the periphery and are medi- ated by transmitters from all three chemical categories. Neurotransmitter Synthesis and Storage Chemical synaptic transmission requires that neurotransmitters be synthe- sized and ready for release. Different neurotransmitters are synthesized in different ways. For example, glutamate and glycine are among the 20 amino acids that are the building blocks of protein (see Figure 3.4b); consequently, they are abundant in all cells of the body, including neurons. In contrast, GABA and the amines are made primarily by the neurons that release them. These neurons contain speciﬁ c enzymes that synthesize the neurotransmit- ters from various metabolic precursors. The synthesizing enzymes for both amino acid and amine neurotransmitters are transported to the axon termi- nal, where they locally and rapidly direct transmitter synthesis. Once synthesized in the cytosol of the axon terminal, the amino acid and amine neurotransmitters must be taken up by the synaptic vesicles. Concentrating these neurotransmitters inside the vesicle is the job of transporters , special proteins embedded in the vesicle membrane. Quite different mechanisms are used to synthesize and store peptides in secretory granules. As we learned in Chapters 2 and 3, peptides are formed when amino acids are strung together by the ribosomes of the cell body. In the case of peptide neurotransmitters, this occurs in the rough ER. Generally, a long peptide synthesized in the rough ER is split in the Golgi apparatus, and one of the smaller peptide fragments is the active neurotransmitter. Secretory granules containing the peptide neurotransmitter bud off from the Golgi apparatus and are carried to the axon terminal by axoplasmic transport. Figure 5.11 compares the synthesis and storage of amine and amino acid neurotransmitters with that of peptide neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitter Release Neurotransmitter release is triggered by the arrival of an action poten- tial in the axon terminal. The depolarization of the terminal membrane causes voltage-gated calcium channels in the active zones to open. These membrane channels are very similar to the sodium channels we discussed in Chapter 4, except they are permeable to Ca 2 \u0002 instead of Na \u0002 . There is a large inward driving force on Ca 2 \u0002 . Remember that the internal calcium ion concentration—[Ca 2 \u0002 ] i —at rest is very low, only 0.0002 mM; therefore, Ca 2 \u0002 will ﬂ ood the cytoplasm of the axon terminal as long as the calcium channels are open. The resulting elevation in [Ca 2 \u0002 ] i is the signal that causes neurotransmitter to be released from synaptic vesicles. The vesicles release their contents by a process called exocytosis . The membrane of the synaptic vesicle fuses to the presynaptic membrane at the active zone, allowing the contents of the vesicle to spill out into the synaptic cleft (Figure 5.12). Studies of a giant synapse in the squid nervous \n123 CHAPTER 5 SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION 3 (a) (b) 2 3 4 Rough ER Secretory granules Precursor molecule Transporter protein Synthesizing enzyme Synaptic vesicle Neurotransmitter molecule Synaptic vesicles Golgi apparatus Active peptide neurotransmitter Precursor peptide Nucleus 1 Ribosome 1 2 ▲ FIGURE 5.11 The synthesis and storage of different types of neurotransmitter.

Synapses in mammals, which gener- ally occur at higher temperatures, are even faster. Exocytosis is quick be- cause Ca 2 \u0002 enters at the active zone precisely where synaptic vesicles are ready and waiting to release their contents. In this local  “microdomain” around the active zone, calcium can achieve relatively high concentra- tions (greater than about 0.01 mM). The mechanism by which [Ca 2 \u0002 ] i stimulates exocytosis has been under intensive investigation. The speed of neurotransmitter release suggests that the vesicles involved are those already “docked” at the active zones. Docking is believed to involve interactions between proteins in the synap- tic vesicle membrane and the presynaptic cell membrane under the active zone (Box 5.3). In the presence of high [Ca 2 \u0002 ] i , these proteins alter their conformation so that the lipid bilayers of the vesicle and presynaptic mem- branes fuse, forming a pore that allows the neurotransmitter to escape into the cleft. The mouth of this exocytotic fusion pore continues to expand until the membrane of the vesicle is fully incorporated into the presynaptic mem- brane (Figure 5.13). The vesicle membrane is later recovered by the process of endocytosis , and the recycled vesicle is reﬁ lled with neurotransmitter (see Figure 5.12). During periods of prolonged stimulation, vesicles are mo- bilized from a “reserve pool” that is bound to the cytoskeleton of the axon terminal. The release of these vesicles from the cytoskeleton, and their docking to the active zone, is also triggered by elevations of [Ca 2 \u0002 ] i . Secretory granules also release peptide neurotransmitters by exo- cytosis, in a calcium-dependent fashion, but typically not at the active zones. Because the sites of granule exocytosis occur at a distance from the sites of Ca 2 \u0002 entry, peptide neurotransmitters are usually not released in response to every action potential invading the terminal. Instead, the release of peptides generally requires high-frequency trains of action potentials, so that the [Ca 2 \u0002 ] i throughout the terminal can build to the level required to trigger release away from the active zones. Unlike the fast release of amino acid and amine neurotransmitters, the release of peptides is a leisurely process, taking 50 msec or more. Neurotransmitter Receptors and Effectors Neurotransmitters released into the synaptic cleft affect the postsynaptic neuron by binding to speciﬁ c receptor proteins that are embedded in the postsynaptic density. The binding of neurotransmitter to the receptor is like inserting a key in a lock; this causes conformational changes in the protein such that the protein can then function differently. Although there are well over 100 different neurotransmitter receptors, they can be classiﬁ ed into two types: transmitter-gated ion channels and G-protein-coupled receptors. Transmitter-Gated Ion Channels. Receptors known as transmitter-gated ion channels are membrane-spanning proteins consisting of four or ﬁ ve subunits that come together to form a pore between them (Figure 5.14). In the absence of neurotransmitter, the pore is usually closed. When neu- rotransmitter binds to speciﬁ c sites on the extracellular region of the channel, it induces a conformational change—just a slight twist of the subunits—which within microseconds causes the pore to open. The func- tional consequence of this depends on which ions can pass through the pore. Transmitter-gated channels generally do not show the same degree of ion selectivity as do voltage-gated channels. For example, the ACh-gated ion channels at the neuromuscular junction are permeable to both Na \u0002 and K \u0002 . Nonetheless, as a rule, if the open channels are permeable to \n125 CHAPTER 5 SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION BOX 5.3 How to SNARE a Vesicle Y easts are single-cell organisms valued for their abil- ity to make dough rise and grape juice ferment into wine. Remarkably, the humble yeasts have some close similarities to the chemical synapses in our brain. Recent research has shown that the proteins controlling secretion in both yeast cells and synapses have only minor differences. Apparently, these molecules are so generally useful that they have been conserved across more than a billion years of evolution, and they are found in all eukaryotic cells. The trick to fast synaptic function is to deliver neurotrans- mitter-ﬁ lled vesicles to just the right place—the presynaptic membrane—and then cause them to fuse at just the right time, when an action potential delivers a pulse of high Ca 2 \u0002 concen- tration to the cytosol. This process of exocytosis is a special case of a more general cellular problem, membrane trafﬁ cking . Cells have many types of membranes, including those enclos- ing the whole cell, the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and various types of vesicles. To avoid intracellular chaos, each of these membranes needs to be moved and deliv- ered to speciﬁ c locations within the cell. After delivery, one type of membrane often has to fuse with another type. A common molecular machinery has evolved for the delivery and fusion of all these membranes, and small variations in these molecules determine how and when membrane trafﬁ cking takes place. The speciﬁ c binding and fusion of membranes seem to depend on the SNARE family of proteins, which were ﬁ rst found in yeast cells. SNARE is an acronym too convoluted to deﬁ ne here, but the name perfectly deﬁ nes the function of these proteins: SNAREs allow one membrane to snare an- other. Each SNARE peptide has a lipid-loving end that em- beds itself within the membrane and a longer tail that projects into the cytosol. Vesicles have “v-SNAREs,” and the outer membrane has “t-SNAREs” (for target membrane). The cy- tosolic ends of these two complementary types of SNAREs can bind very tightly to one another, allowing a vesicle to “dock” very close to a presynaptic membrane and nowhere else (Figure A). Although complexes of v-SNAREs and t-SNAREs form the main connection between vesicle membrane and target membrane, a large and bewildering array of other presyn- aptic proteins stick to this SNARE complex. We still don’t understand the functions of all of them, but synaptotagmin , a vesicle protein, is the critical Ca 2 \u0002 sensor that rapidly trig- gers vesicle fusion and thus transmitter release. On the pre- synaptic membrane side, calcium channels may form part of the docking complex. As the calcium channels are very close to the docked vesicles, inﬂ owing Ca 2 \u0002 can trigger transmit- ter release with astonishing speed—within about 60 \u0003 sec in a mammalian synapse at body temperature. The brain has several varieties of synaptotagmins, including one that is spe- cialized for exceptionally fast synaptic transmission. We have a way to go before we understand all the mol- ecules involved in synaptic transmission. In the meantime, we can count on yeasts to provide delightful brain food (and drink) for thought.

Because it tends to bring the mem- brane potential toward threshold for generating action potentials, this effect is said to be excitatory . A transient postsynaptic membrane depo- larization caused by the presynaptic release of neurotransmitter is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) (Figure 5.15). Synaptic activation of ACh-gated and glutamate-gated ion channels causes EPSPs. If the transmitter-gated channels are permeable to Cl \u0004 , the usual net effect will be to hyperpolarize the postsynaptic cell from the resting mem- brane potential (because the chloride equilibrium potential is usually neg- ative; see Chapter 3). Because it tends to bring the membrane potential away from threshold for generating action potentials, this effect is said to be inhibitory . A transient hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic mem- brane potential caused by the presynaptic release of neurotransmitter is called an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) (Figure 5.16). Synaptic activation of glycine-gated or GABA-gated ion channels cause an IPSP. We’ll discuss EPSPs and IPSPs in more detail shortly when we explore the principles of synaptic integration. G-Protein-Coupled Receptors. Fast chemical synaptic transmission is mediated by amino acid and amine neurotransmitters acting on trans- mitter-gated ion channels. However, all three types of neurotransmitter, acting on G-protein-coupled receptors , can also have slower, longer lasting, and much more diverse postsynaptic actions. This type of trans- mitter action involves three steps: 1. Neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptor proteins embedded in the postsynaptic membrane.

(b) Top view of the channel, showing the pore at the center of the five subunits. \n127 CHAPTER 5 SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION BOX 5.4 Reversal Potentials I n Chapter 4, we saw that when the membrane voltage- gated sodium channels open during an action potential, Na \u0002 enters the cell, causing the membrane potential to rapidly depolarize until it approaches the sodium equilibrium poten- tial, E Na , about 40 mV. Unlike the voltage-gated channels, however, many transmitter-gated ion channels are not per- meable to a single type of ion. For example, the ACh-gated ion channel at the neuromuscular junction is permeable to both Na \u0002 and K \u0002 . Let’s explore the functional consequence of activating these channels. In Chapter 3, we learned that the membrane potential, V m , can be calculated using the Goldman equation, which takes into account the relative permeability of the membrane to different ions (see Box 3.3). If the membrane were equally permeable to Na \u0002 and K \u0002 , as it would be if many ACh- or glutamate-gated channels were open, then V m would have a value between E Na and E K , around 0 mV. Therefore, ionic current would ﬂ ow through the channels in a direction that brings the membrane potential toward 0 mV. If the mem- brane  potential were \u0005 0 mV before ACh was applied, as is usually the case, the direction of net current ﬂ ow through the  ACh-gated ion channels would be inward , causing a depolarization. However, if the membrane potential were \u0006 0 mV before ACh was applied, the direction of net current ﬂ ow through the ACh-gated ion channels would be outward , causing the membrane potential to become less positive. Ionic current ﬂ ow at different membrane voltages can be graphed, as shown in Figure A. Such a graph is called an I-V plot (I: current; V: voltage). The critical value of membrane potential at which the direction of current ﬂ ow reverses is called the reversal potential . In this case, the reversal  potential would be 0 mV. The experimental determination of a rever- sal potential, therefore, helps tell us which types of ions the membrane is permeable to. If, by changing the relative permeability of the membrane to different ions, a neurotransmitter causes V m to move to- ward a value that is more positive than the action potential threshold, the neurotransmitter action would be termed excitatory. As a rule, neurotransmitters that open a chan- nel permeable to Na \u0002 are excitatory. If a neurotransmitter causes V m to take on a value that is more negative than the action potential threshold, the neurotransmitter action would be termed inhibitory. Neurotransmitters that open a channel permeable to Cl \u0004 tend to be inhibitory, as are neurotransmit- ters that open a channel permeable only to K \u0002 .

The receptor proteins activate small proteins, called G-proteins , which are free to move along the intracellular face of the postsynaptic membrane. 3. The activated G-proteins activate “effector” proteins. Effector proteins can be G-protein-gated ion channels in the membrane (Figure 5.17a), or they can be enzymes that synthesize molecules called second messengers that diffuse away in the cytosol (Figure 5.17b). Second messengers can activate additional enzymes in the cytosol that can regulate ion channel function and alter cellular metabolism. Because G-protein-coupled receptors can trigger widespread metabolic effects, they are often referred to as metabotropic receptors . \n128 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS We’ll discuss the different neurotransmitters, their receptors, and their effectors in more detail in Chapter 6. However, you should be aware that the same neurotransmitter can have different postsynaptic actions, de- pending on what receptors it binds to. An example is the effect of ACh on the heart and on skeletal muscles. ACh slows the rhythmic contractions of the heart by causing a slow hyperpolarization of the cardiac muscle cells. In contrast, in skeletal muscle, ACh induces contraction by caus- ing a rapid depolarization of the muscle ﬁ bers. These different actions are explained by the different receptors involved. In the heart, a metabo- tropic ACh receptor is coupled by a G-protein to a potassium channel. The opening of the potassium channel hyperpolarizes the cardiac muscle ﬁ bers and reduces the rate at which it ﬁ res action potentials. In skeletal muscle, the receptor is a transmitter-gated ion channel, speciﬁ cally an ACh-gated ion channel, permeable to Na \u0002 . The opening of this channel depolarizes the muscle ﬁ bers and makes them more excitable. Autoreceptors. Besides being a part of the postsynaptic density, neu- rotransmitter receptors are also commonly found in the membrane of the presynaptic axon terminal.

The binding of neurotrans- mitter to the receptor leads to the activation of G-proteins. Activated G-proteins activate effector proteins, which may be (a) ion channels or (b) enzymes that generate intracellular second messengers. \n130 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS neurotransmitter released by the presynaptic terminal are called auto- receptors . Typically, autoreceptors are G-protein-coupled receptors that stimulate second messenger formation. The consequences of activating these receptors vary, but a common effect is inhibition of neurotransmit- ter release and, in some cases, neurotransmitter synthesis. This allows a presynaptic terminal to regulate itself. Autoreceptors appear to function as a sort of safety valve to reduce release when the concentration of neu- rotransmitter around the presynaptic terminal gets too high. Neurotransmitter Recovery and Degradation Once the released neurotransmitter has interacted with postsynaptic receptors, it must be cleared from the synaptic cleft to allow another round of synaptic transmission. One way this happens is by simple diffu- sion of the transmitter molecules through the extracellular ﬂ uid and away from the synapse. For most of the amino acid and amine neurotransmit- ters, however, diffusion is aided by their reuptake into the presynaptic axon terminal. Reuptake occurs by the action of speciﬁ c neurotransmitter transporter proteins located in the presynaptic membrane. Once inside the cytosol of the terminal, the transmitters may be reloaded into syn- aptic vesicles or enzymatically degraded and their breakdown products recycled. Neurotransmitter transporters also exist in the membranes of glia surrounding the synapse, which assist in the removal of neurotrans- mitter from the cleft. Neurotransmitter action can also be terminated by enzymatic destruc- tion in the synaptic cleft itself. This is how ACh is removed at the neuro- muscular junction, for example. The enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is deposited in the cleft by the muscle cells. AChE cleaves the ACh mol- ecule, rendering it inactive at the ACh receptors. The importance of transmitter removal from the cleft should not be un- derestimated. At the neuromuscular junction, for example, uninterrupted exposure to high concentrations of ACh after several seconds leads to a process called desensitization , in which, despite the continued presence of ACh, the transmitter-gated channels close. This desensitized state can persist for many seconds even after the neurotransmitter is removed. The rapid destruction of ACh by AChE normally prevents  desensitization from occurring. However, if the AChE is inhibited, as it is by various nerve gases used as chemical weapons, the ACh receptors will become desensitized and neuromuscular transmission will fail. Neuropharmacology Each of the steps of synaptic transmission we have discussed so far—neu- rotransmitter synthesis, loading into synaptic vesicles, exocytosis, bind- ing and activation of receptors, reuptake, and degradation—is chemical, and therefore these steps can be affected by speciﬁ c drugs and toxins (Box 5.5). The study of the effects of drugs on nervous system tissue is called neuropharmacology . Earlier, we mentioned that nerve gases can interfere with synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by inhibiting the enzyme AChE. This interference represents one class of drug action, which is to inhibit the normal function of speciﬁ c proteins involved in synaptic trans- mission; such drugs are called inhibitors . Inhibitors of neurotransmitter receptors, called receptor antagonists , bind to the receptors and block (antagonize) the normal action of the transmitter. An example of a recep- tor antagonist is curare, an arrow-tip poison traditionally used by South American natives to paralyze their prey. Curare binds tightly to the ACh \n131 CHAPTER 5 SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION receptors on skeletal muscle cells and blocks the actions of ACh, thereby preventing muscle contraction. Other drugs bind to receptors, but instead of inhibiting them, they mimic the actions of the naturally occurring neurotransmitter. These drugs are called receptor agonists . An example of a receptor agonist is nicotine, derived from the tobacco plant. Nicotine binds to and activates the ACh receptors in skeletal muscle. In fact, the ACh-gated ion channels in muscle are also called nicotinic ACh receptors , to distinguish them from other types of ACh receptors, such as those in the heart, that are not activated by nicotine. There are also nicotinic ACh receptors in the CNS, and these are involved in the addictive effects of tobacco use. The immense chemical complexity of synaptic transmission makes it especially susceptible to the medical corollary of Murphy’s law, which O F  S P E C I A L  I N T E R E S T BOX 5.5 Bacteria, Spiders, Snakes, and People W hat do the bacteria Clostridium botulinum , black widow spiders, cobras, and humans have in common? They all produce toxins that attack the chemical synaptic transmis- sion that occurs at the neuromuscular junction. Botulism is caused by several kinds of botulinum neurotoxins that are produced by the growth of C. botulinum in improperly canned foods. (The name comes from the Latin word for “sausage” because of the early association of the disease with poorly preserved meat.) Botulinum toxins are very potent blockers of neuromuscular transmission; it has been estimated that as few as 10 molecules of the toxins are enough to inhibit a cholinergic synapse. Botulinum toxins are extraordinarily speciﬁ c enzymes that destroy certain of the SNARE proteins in the presynaptic terminals, which are critical for transmitter release (see Box 5.3). This speciﬁ c action of the toxins made them important tools in the early research on SNAREs. Although its mechanism of action is different, black widow spider venom also exerts deadly effects by affecting transmit- ter release (Figure A). The venom contains latrotoxin, which ﬁ rst increases, and then eliminates, ACh release at the neu- romuscular junction. Electron microscopic examination of synapses poisoned with black widow spider venom reveals that the axon terminals are swollen and the synaptic vesicles are missing. The action of latrotoxin, a protein molecule, is not entirely understood. Venom binds with proteins on the outside of the presynaptic membrane and forms a membrane pore that depolarizes the terminal and allows Ca 2 \u0002 to enter and trigger rapid and total depletion of transmitter. In some cases, the venom can induce transmitter release even with- out the need for Ca 2 \u0002 , perhaps by interacting directly with neurotransmitter release proteins. The bite of the Taiwanese cobra also results in the block- ade of neuromuscular transmission in its victim, by yet an- other mechanism. One of the active compounds in the snake’s venom, called \u0002 -bungarotoxin , is a peptide that binds so tightly to the postsynaptic nicotinic ACh receptors that it takes days to be removed. Often, there is not time for its re- moval, however, because cobra toxin prevents the activation of nicotinic receptors by ACh, thereby paralyzing the respira- tory muscles of its victims. We humans have synthesized a large number of chemi- cals that poison synaptic transmission at the neuromuscu- lar junction. Originally motivated by the search for chemical warfare agents, this effort led to the development of a new class of compounds called organophosphates . These are irreversible inhibitors of AChE. By preventing the degradation of ACh, they cause it to accumulate and probably kill victims by causing a desensitization of ACh receptors. The organo- phosphates used today as insecticides, like parathion, are toxic to humans only in high doses. Figure A Black widow spiders.

When chemical synaptic transmission goes wrong, the nervous system malfunc- tions. Defective neurotransmission is believed to be the root cause of a large number of neurological and psychiatric disorders. The good news is that, thanks to our growing knowledge of the neuropharmacology of syn- aptic transmission, clinicians have new and increasingly effective thera- peutic drugs for treating these disorders. We’ll discuss the synaptic basis of some psychiatric disorders, and their neuropharmacological treatment, in Chapter 22. PRINCIPLES OF SYNAPTIC INTEGRATION Most CNS neurons receive thousands of synaptic inputs that activate different combinations of transmitter-gated ion channels and G-protein- coupled receptors. The postsynaptic neuron integrates all these complex ionic and chemical signals to produce a simple form of output: action po- tentials. The transformation of many synaptic inputs to a single neuronal output constitutes a neural computation. The brain performs billions of neural computations every second we are alive. As a ﬁ rst step toward un- derstanding how neural computations are performed, let’s explore some basic principles of synaptic integration. Synaptic integration is the process by which multiple synaptic potentials combine within one post- synaptic neuron. The Integration of EPSPs The most elementary postsynaptic response is the opening of a single transmitter-gated channel (Figure 5.18). Inward current through these channels depolarizes the postsynaptic membrane, causing the EPSP. The postsynaptic membrane of one synapse may have from a few tens to several thousands of transmitter-gated channels; how many of these are activated during synaptic transmission depends mainly on how much neurotransmitter is released. Quantal Analysis of EPSPs. The elementary unit of neurotransmitter release is the contents of a single synaptic vesicle. Vesicles each contain about the same number of transmitter molecules (several thousand); the total amount of transmitter released is some multiple of this number. P R I N C IP L E S O F S Y NA P T IC IN T E G RATIO N 20 msec Channels closed Channels open Application of neurotransmitter to membrane patch Inward current flowing No current flowing ▲ FIGURE 5.18 A patch-clamp recording from a transmitter-gated ion channel. Ionic current passes through the channels when the channels are open. In the presence of neurotransmitter, they rapidly alternate between open and closed states. (Source: Adapted from Neher and Sakmann, 1992.) \n133 CHAPTER 5 SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION Consequently, the amplitude of the postsynaptic EPSP is some multiple of the response to the contents of a single vesicle. Stated another way, post- synaptic EPSPs at a given synapse are quantized ; they are multiples of an indivisible unit, the quantum , which reﬂ ects the number of transmit- ter molecules in a single synaptic vesicle and the number of postsynaptic receptors available at the synapse. At many synapses, exocytosis of vesicles occurs at some very low rate in the absence of presynaptic stimulation. The size of the postsynaptic re- sponse to this spontaneously released neurotransmitter can be measured electrophysiologically. This tiny response is a miniature postsynaptic potential , often called simply a mini . Each mini is generated by the transmitter contents of one vesicle. The amplitude of the postsynaptic EPSP evoked by a presynaptic action potential, then, is simply an integer multiple (i.e., 1 \u0007 , 2 \u0007 , 3 \u0007 , etc.) of the mini amplitude. Quantal analysis , a method of comparing the amplitudes of minia- ture and evoked PSPs, can be used to determine how many vesicles re- lease neurotransmitter during normal synaptic transmission. Quantal analysis of transmission at the neuromuscular junction reveals that a single action potential in the presynaptic terminal triggers the exocytosis of about 200 synaptic vesicles, causing an EPSP of 40 mV or more. At many CNS synapses, in striking contrast, the contents of only a single vesicle are released in response to a presynaptic action potential, causing an EPSP of only a few tenths of a millivolt. EPSP Summation. The difference between excitatory transmission at neuromuscular junctions and CNS synapses is not surprising. The neu- romuscular junction has evolved to be fail-safe; it needs to work every time, and the best way to ensure this is to generate an EPSP of a huge size. On the other hand, if every CNS synapse were, by itself, capable of triggering an action potential in its postsynaptic cell (as the neuromuscu- lar junction can), then a neuron would be little more than a simple relay station. Instead, most neurons perform more sophisticated computations, requiring that many EPSPs add together to produce a signiﬁ cant post- synaptic depolarization. This is what is meant by integration of EPSPs. EPSP summation represents the simplest form of synaptic integra- tion in the CNS. There are two types of summation: spatial and tem- poral. Spatial summation is the adding together of EPSPs generated simultaneously at many different synapses on a dendrite. Temporal summation is the adding together of EPSPs generated at the same synapse if they occur in rapid succession, within about 1–15 msec of one another (Figure 5.19). The Contribution of Dendritic Properties to Synaptic Integration Even with the summation of several EPSPs on a dendrite, the depolar- ization still may not be enough to cause the neuron to ﬁ re an action po- tential. The current entering at the sites of synaptic contact must spread down the dendrite and through the soma and cause the membrane of the spike-initiation zone to be depolarized beyond threshold, before an action potential can be generated. The effectiveness of an excitatory synapse in triggering an action potential, therefore, depends on how far the synapse is from the spike-initiation zone and on the properties of the dendritic membrane. Dendritic Cable Properties. To simplify the analysis of how dendritic properties contribute to synaptic integration, let’s assume that dendrites \n134 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS function as cylindrical cables that are electrically passive, that is, lack- ing voltage-gated ion channels (in contrast, of course, with axons). Using an analogy introduced in Chapter 4, imagine that the inﬂ ux of positive charge at a synapse is like turning on the water that will ﬂ ow down a leaky garden hose (the dendrite). There are two paths the water can take: down the inside of the hose or through the leaks. By the same token, there are two paths that synaptic current can take: down the inside of the den- drite or across the dendritic membrane. As the current proceeds down the dendrite and farther from the synapse, the EPSP amplitude will dimin- ish because of the leakage of ionic current through membrane channels. At some distance from the site of current inﬂ ux, the EPSP amplitude may eventually approach zero. The decrease in depolarization as a function of distance along a den- dritic cable is plotted in Figure 5.20. In order to simplify the math- ematics, in this example, we’ll assume the dendrite is inﬁ nitely long, unbranched, and uniform in diameter. We will also use a microelec- trode to inject a long, steady pulse of current to induce a membrane depolarization. Notice that the amount of depolarization falls off ex- ponentially with increasing distance. Depolarization of the membrane at a given distance (V x ) can be described by the equation V x \b V o /e x/ , where V o is depolarization at the origin (just under the microelectrode), e ( \b 2.718 . . .) is the base of natural logarithms, x is distance from the synapse, and is a constant that depends on the properties of the dendrite. Notice that when x \b , then V x \b V o /e. Put another way, V \b 0.37 (V o ). This distance , where the depolarization is about 37% of that at the origin, is called the dendritic length constant .

The length constant is an index of how far depolarization can spread down a dendrite or axon. The longer the length constant, the more likely it is that EPSPs generated at distant synapses will depolarize the membrane at the axon hillock. The value of in our idealized, elec- trically passive dendrite depends on two factors: (1) the resistance to current ﬂ owing longitudinally down the dendrite, called the internal resistance (r i ); and (2) the resistance to current ﬂ owing across the membrane, called the membrane resistance (r m ). Most current will take the path of least resistance; therefore, the value of will increase as membrane resistance increases because more depolarizing current will ﬂ ow down the inside of the dendrite rather than “leaking” out the membrane. The value of will decrease as internal resistance increases because more current will then ﬂ ow across the membrane. Just as water will ﬂ ow farther down a wide hose with few leaks, synaptic current will ﬂ ow farther down a wide dendrite (low r i ) with few open membrane channels (high r m ). The internal resistance depends only on the diameter of the dendrite and the electrical properties of the cytoplasm; consequently, it is rela- tively constant in a mature neuron. The membrane resistance, in con- trast, depends on the number of open ion channels, which changes from moment to moment depending on what other synapses are active. The dendritic length constant, therefore, is not constant at all! As we will see in a moment, ﬂ uctuations in the value of are an important factor in synaptic integration.

(b) A plot of membrane depolarization as a function of distance along the dendrite. At the distance , one length constant, the membrane depolarization (V ), is 37% of that at the origin. \n136 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS Excitable Dendrites. Our analysis of dendritic cable properties made another important assumption: The dendrite’s membrane is electrically passive, which means it lacks voltage-gated channels. Some dendrites in the brain have nearly passive and inexcitable membranes and thus do follow the simple cable equations. The dendrites of spinal motor neu- rons, for example, are very close to passive. However, most dendrites are decidedly not passive. A variety of neurons have dendrites with signiﬁ - cant numbers of voltage-gated sodium, calcium, and potassium channels. Dendrites rarely have enough ion channels to generate fully propagating action potentials, as axons can. But the voltage-gated channels in den- drites can act as important ampliﬁ ers of small PSPs generated far out on dendrites. EPSPs that would diminish to near nothingness in a long, passive dendrite may nevertheless be large enough to trigger the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels, which in turn add current to boost the synaptic signal along toward the soma. Paradoxically, in some cells, dendritic sodium channels may also carry electrical signals in the other direction, from the soma outward along dendrites. This may be a mechanism by which synapses on dendrites are informed that a spike occurred in the soma, and it has relevance for hypotheses about the cellular mechanisms of learning that will be dis- cussed in Chapter 25. Inhibition So far, we’ve seen that whether or not an EPSP contributes to the action potential output of a neuron depends on several factors, including the number of coactive excitatory synapses, the distance the synapse is from the spike-initiation zone, and the properties of the dendritic membrane. Of course, not all synapses in the brain are excitatory. The action of some synapses is to take the membrane potential away from action potential threshold; these are called inhibitory synapses . Inhibitory synapses exert a powerful control over a neuron’s output (Box 5.6). IPSPs and Shunting Inhibition. The postsynaptic receptors under most inhibitory synapses are very similar to those under excitatory synapses; they’re transmitter-gated ion channels. The only important differences are that they bind different neurotransmitters (either GABA or glycine) and that they allow different ions to pass through their channels. The transmitter-gated channels of most inhibitory synapses are permeable to only one natural ion, Cl \u0004 . Opening of the chloride channel allows Cl \u0004 to cross the membrane in a direction that brings the membrane potential toward the chloride equilibrium potential, E Cl , about \u0004 65 mV. If the membrane potential were less negative than \u0004 65 mV when the transmit- ter was released, activation of these channels would cause a hyperpolar- izing IPSP. Notice that if the resting membrane potential were already \u0004 65 mV, no IPSP would be visible after chloride channel activation because the value of the membrane potential would already equal E Cl (i.e., the rever- sal potential for that synapse; see Box 5.4). If there is no visible IPSP, is the neuron really inhibited? The answer is yes. Consider the situation illustrated in Figure 5.21, with an excitatory synapse on a distal seg- ment of dendrite and an inhibitory synapse on a proximal segment of dendrite, near the soma. Activation of the excitatory synapse leads to the inﬂ ux of positive charge into the dendrite. This current depolarizes the membrane as it ﬂ ows toward the soma. At the site of the active inhibi- tory synapse, however, the membrane potential is approximately equal to \n137 CHAPTER 5 SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION E Cl , \u0004 65 mV. Positive current, therefore, ﬂ ows outward across the mem- brane at this site to bring V m to \u0004 65 mV. This synapse acts as an electri- cal shunt, preventing the current from ﬂ owing through the soma to the axon hillock. This type of inhibition is called shunting inhibition . The actual  physical basis of shunting inhibition is the inward movement of negatively charged chloride ions, which is formally equivalent to outward positive current ﬂ ow. Shunting inhibition is like cutting a big hole in the leaky garden hose—more of the water ﬂ ows down this path of least resis- tance, out of the hose, before it gets to the nozzle where it can “activate” the ﬂ owers in your garden. Thus, you can see that the action of inhibitory synapses also  contributes to synaptic integration. The IPSPs reduce the size of EPSPs, making the postsynaptic neuron less likely to ﬁ re action potentials. In addition, shunting inhibition acts to drastically reduce r m and consequently , thus allowing positive current to ﬂ ow out across the membrane instead of internally down the dendrite toward the spike-initiation zone. O F  S P E C I A L  I N T E R E S T BOX 5.6 Startling Mutations and Poisons A ﬂ ash of lightning . . . a thunderclap . . . a tap on the shoulder when you think you’re alone! If you are not expect- ing them, any of these stimuli can make you jump, grimace, hunch your shoulders, and breathe faster. We all know the brief but  dramatic nature of the startle response. Luckily, when lightning strikes twice or a friend taps our shoulder again, we tend to be much less startled the sec- ond time. We quickly habituate and relax. However, for an unfortunate minority of mice, cows, dogs, horses, and peo- ple, life is a succession of exaggerated startle responses. Even normally benign stimuli, such as hands clapping or a touch to the nose, may trigger an uncontrollable stiffening of the body, an involuntary shout, ﬂ exion of the arms and legs, and a fall to the ground. Worse yet, these overreactions don’t adapt when the stimuli are repeated. The clinical term for startle disease is hyperekplexia , and the ﬁ rst recorded cases were members of a community of French–Canadian lumberjacks in 1878. Hyperekplexia is an inherited condition occurring worldwide, and its sufferers are known by colorful local names: the “Jumping Frenchmen of Maine” (Quebec), “myriachit” (Siberia), “latah” (Malaysia), and “Ragin’ Cajuns” (Louisiana). We now know the molecular basis for two general types of startle diseases. Remarkably, both involve defects of in- hibitory glycine receptors. The ﬁ rst type, identiﬁ ed in humans and in a mutant mouse called spasmodic , is caused by a mutation of a gene for the glycine receptor. The change is the smallest one possible—the abnormal receptors have only one amino acid (out of more than 400) coded wrong—but the result is a chloride channel that opens less frequently when exposed to the neurotransmitter glycine. The second type of startle disease is seen in the mutant mouse spastic and in a strain of cattle. In these animals, normal glycine receptors are expressed but in fewer than normal numbers. The two forms of startle disease thus take different routes to the same unfortunate end: The transmitter glycine is less effective at inhibiting neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem. Most neural circuits depend on a delicate balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition for normal functioning. If  excitation is increased or inhibition reduced, then a turbu- lent and hyperexcitable state may result. An impairment of glycine function yields exaggerated startles; reduced GABA function can lead to the seizures of epilepsy (as discussed in Chapter 19). How can such diseases be treated? There is often a clear and simple logic. Drugs that enhance inhibition can be very helpful. The genetic mutations of the glycine system resemble strychnine poisoning. Strychnine is a powerful toxin found in the seeds and bark of certain trees and shrubs of the genus Strychnos . It was ﬁ rst isolated and identiﬁ ed chemically in the early nineteenth century. Strychnine has traditionally been used by farmers to eradicate pesky rodents and by murder- ers. It has a simple mechanism of action: It is an antagonist of glycine at its receptor. Mild strychnine poisoning enhances startle and other reﬂ exes and resembles hyperekplexia. High doses nearly eliminate glycine-mediated inhibition in circuits of the spinal cord and brain stem. This leads to uncontrollable seizures and unchecked muscular contractions, spasm and paralysis of the respiratory muscles, and ultimately, death from asphyxiation. It is a painful, agonizing way to die. Since glycine is not a transmitter in the higher centers of the brain, strych- nine itself does not impair cognitive or sensory functions. \n138 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS The Geometry of Excitatory and Inhibitory Synapses. Inhibitory syn- apses in the brain that use GABA or glycine as a neurotransmitter have a morphology characteristic of Gray’s type II (see Figure 5.8b). This struc- ture contrasts with excitatory synapses that use glutamate, which have a Gray’s type I morphology. This correlation between structure and function has been useful for working out the geometric relationships among excit- atory and inhibitory synapses on individual neurons. In addition to being spread over the dendrites, inhibitory synapses on many neurons are found clustered on the soma and near the axon hillock, where they are in an espe- cially powerful position to inﬂ uence the activity of the postsynaptic neuron. Modulation Most of the postsynaptic mechanisms we’ve discussed so far involve trans- mitter receptors that are, themselves, ion channels. To be sure, synapses with transmitter-gated channels carry the bulk of the speciﬁ c information V m of dendrite V m of soma (a) (b) EPSP Dendrite Dendrite Record V m Record V m Record V m Record V m Excitatory synapse (active) Inhibitory synapse (inactive) Excitatory synapse (active) Inhibitory synapse (active) Axon hillock Soma Axon hillock Soma V m of dendrite V m of soma EPSP ▲ FIGURE 5.21 Shunting inhibition.

(b) When the inhibi- tory and excitatory inputs are stimulated together, the depolarizing current leaks out before it reaches the soma. \n139 CHAPTER 5 SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION that is processed by the nervous system. However, there are many synapses with G-protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptors that are not directly associated with an ion channel. Synaptic activation of these receptors does not directly evoke EPSPs and IPSPs but instead modiﬁ es the effectiveness of EPSPs generated by other synapses with transmitter-gated channels. This type of synaptic transmission is called modulation . We’ll give you a taste for how modulation inﬂ uences synaptic integration by exploring the effects of activating one type of G-protein-coupled receptor in the brain, the norepinephrine beta ( ) receptor. The binding of the amine neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) to the receptor triggers a cascade of biochemical events within the cell. In short, the receptor activates a G-protein that, in turn, activates an ef- fector protein, the intracellular enzyme adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl  cyclase catalyzes the chemical reaction that converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the product of oxidative metabolism in the mitochondria, into a compound called cyclic adenosine monophosphate , or cAMP , that is free to diffuse within the cytosol. Thus, the ﬁ rst chemical message of synaptic transmis- sion (the release of NE into the synaptic cleft) is converted by the receptor into a second message (cAMP); cAMP is an example of a second messenger. The effect of cAMP is to stimulate another enzyme known as a protein kinase. Protein kinases catalyze a chemical reaction called phosphorylation , the transfer of phosphate groups (PO 3 ) from ATP to speciﬁ c sites on cell proteins (Figure 5.22). The signiﬁ cance of phosphory- lation is that it can change the conformation of a protein, thereby chang- ing that protein’s activity. In some neurons, one of the proteins that is phosphorylated when cAMP concentration rises is a particular type of potassium channel in the dendritic membrane. Phosphorylation causes this channel to close, thereby reducing the membrane K \u0002 conductance. By itself, this does not cause any dramatic effects on the neuron. But consider the wider conse- quence: Decreasing the K \u0002 conductance increases the dendritic membrane resistance and therefore increases the length constant. It is like wrapping the leaky garden hose in duct tape; more water can ﬂ ow down the inside of the hose and less leaks out the sides. As a consequence of increasing , distant or weak excitatory synapses will become more effective in depolar- izing the spike-initiation zone beyond threshold; the cell will become more excitable . Thus, the binding of NE to receptors produces little change in membrane potential but greatly increases the response produced by another neurotransmitter at an excitatory synapse. Because this effect G-protein NE Adenylyl cyclase Potassium channel \u0002 receptor Protein kinase 1 2 3 4 5 FIGURE 5.22 Modulation by the NE \u0002 receptor. ➀ The binding of NE to the receptor activates a G-protein in the membrane. ➁ The G-protein activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. ➂ Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP into the second messenger cAMP. ➃ cAMP activates a protein kinase. ➄ The protein kinase causes a potassium channel to close by attaching a phosphate group to it. \n140 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS involves several biochemical intermediaries, it can last far longer than the presence of the modulatory transmitter itself. We have described one particular G-protein-coupled receptor and the con- sequences of activating it in one type of neuron. But it is important to recog- nize that other types of receptors can lead to the formation of other types of second messenger molecules. Activation of each of these receptor types will initiate a distinct cascade of biochemical reactions in the postsynaptic neu- ron that do not always include phosphorylation and decreases in membrane conductance. In fact, cAMP in a different cell type with different enzymes may produce functionally opposite changes in the excitability of cells. In Chapter 6, we will describe more examples of synaptic modulation and their mechanisms. However, you can already see that modulatory forms of synaptic transmission offer an almost limitless number of ways that information encoded by presynaptic impulse activity can be trans- formed and used by the postsynaptic neuron. CONCLUDING REMARKS This chapter has covered the basic principles of chemical synaptic trans- mission. The action potential that arose in the sensory nerve when you stepped on that thumbtack in Chapter 3, and that swept along the axon in Chapter 4, has now reached the axon terminal in the spinal cord. The depolarization of the terminal triggered the presynaptic entry of Ca 2 \u0002 through voltage-gated calcium channels, which then stimulated exocy- tosis of the contents of synaptic vesicles. Liberated neurotransmitter dif- fused across the synaptic cleft and attached to speciﬁ c receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. The transmitter (probably glutamate) caused transmitter-gated channels to open, which allowed positive charge to enter the postsynaptic dendrite. Because the sensory nerve was ﬁ ring action potentials at a high rate, and because many synapses were acti- vated at the same time, the EPSPs summed to bring the spike-initiation zone of the postsynaptic neuron to threshold, and this cell then generated action potentials. If the postsynaptic cell is a motor neuron, this activity will cause the release of ACh at the neuromuscular junction and muscle contraction to jerk your foot away from the tack. If the postsynaptic cell is an interneuron that uses GABA as a neurotransmitter, the activity of the cell will result in inhibition of its synaptic targets. If this cell uses a mod- ulatory transmitter such as NE, the activity could cause lasting changes in the excitability or metabolism of its synaptic targets. It is this rich diversity of chemical synaptic interactions that allows complex  behaviors (such as shrieking with pain as you jerk up your foot) to emerge from simple stimuli (such as stepping on a thumbtack). Although we surveyed chemical synaptic transmission in this  chapter, we did not cover the chemistry of synaptic transmission in any detail. In Chapter 6, we’ll take a closer look at the chemical “nuts and bolts” of different neurotransmitter systems. In Chapter 15, after we’ve examined the sensory and motor systems in Part II, we’ll explore the contributions of several different neurotransmitters to nervous system function and be- havior. You’ll see that the chemistry of synaptic transmission warrants all this attention because defective neurotransmission is the basis for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. And virtually all psychoactive drugs, both therapeutic and illicit, exert their effects at chemical synapses. In addition to explaining aspects of neural information processing and the effects of drugs, chemical synaptic transmission is also the key to understanding the neural basis of learning and memory.

This chapter suggests possible sites of modiﬁ cation, ranging from changes in presynaptic Ca 2 \u0002 entry and neu- rotransmitter release to alterations in postsynaptic receptors or excit- ability. As we shall see in Chapter 25, all of these changes are likely to contribute to the storage of information by the nervous system.

As we have seen, some of the brain’s most important chemi- cal reactions are those associated with synaptic transmission. Chapter 5 introduced the general principles of chemical synaptic transmission, using a few speciﬁ c neurotransmitters as examples. In this chapter, we will explore in more depth the variety and elegance of the major neurotrans- mitter systems. Neurotransmitter systems begin with neurotransmitters. In Chapter 5, we discussed the three major classes of neurotransmitters: amino acids , amines , and peptides . Even a partial list of the known transmitters, such as that appearing in Table 5.1, has more than 20 different molecules. Each of these molecules can deﬁ ne a particular transmitter system. In addition to the molecule itself, a neurotransmitter system includes all the molecular machinery responsible for transmitter synthesis, vesicular packaging, reuptake and degradation, and transmitter action (Figure 6.1). The ﬁ rst molecule positively identiﬁ ed as a neurotransmitter by Otto Loewi in the 1920s was acetylcholine, or ACh (see Box 5.1). To describe the cells that produce and release ACh, British pharmacologist Henry Dale introduced the term cholinergic . (Dale shared the 1936 Nobel Prize with Loewi in recognition of his neuropharmacological studies of synaptic transmission.) Dale termed the neurons that use the amine neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) noradrenergic . (NE is known as noradrenaline in United Kingdom.) The convention of using the sufﬁ x -ergic continued when additional transmitters were identiﬁ ed. I NT R O D U C TIO N FIGURE 6.1 Elements of neurotransmitter systems.

These adjectives are also used to iden- tify the various neurotransmitter systems. For example, ACh and all the molecular machinery associated with it are collectively called the cholinergic system . With this terminology in hand, we can begin our exploration of the neurotransmitter systems. We start with a discussion of the experimen- tal strategies that have been used to study transmitter systems. Then we will look at the synthesis and metabolism of speciﬁ c neurotransmit- ters and explore how these molecules exert their postsynaptic effects. In Chapter 15, after we have learned more about the structural and functional organization of the nervous system, we’ll take another look at  speciﬁ c neurotransmitter systems in the context of their individual contributions to the regulation of brain function and behavior. STUDYING NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS The ﬁ rst step in studying a neurotransmitter system is usually identi- fying the neurotransmitter. This is no simple task; the brain contains uncountable different chemicals. How can we decide which few chemicals are used as transmitters? Over the years, neuroscientists have established certain criteria that must be met for a molecule to be considered a neurotransmitter: 1. The molecule must be synthesized and stored in the presynaptic neuron. 2. The molecule must be released by the presynaptic axon terminal upon stimulation. 3. The molecule, when experimentally applied, must produce a response in the postsynaptic cell that mimics the response produced by the release of neurotransmitter from the presynaptic neuron. Let’s start by exploring some of the strategies and methods that are used to satisfy these criteria. Localization of Transmitters and Transmitter- Synthesizing Enzymes The scientist often begins with little more than a hunch that a particular molecule may be a neurotransmitter. This idea may be based on observing that the molecule is concentrated in brain tissue or that the application of the molecule to certain neurons alters their action potential ﬁ ring rate. Whatever the inspiration, the ﬁ rst step in conﬁ rming the hypothesis is to show that the molecule is, in fact, localized in, and synthesized by, par- ticular neurons. Many methods have been used to satisfy this criterion for different neurotransmitters. Two of the most important techniques used today are immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. Immunocytochemistry. The method of immunocytochemistry is used to anatomically localize particular molecules to particular cells. When the same technique is applied to thin sections of tissue, including brain, it is often referred to as immunohistochemistry . The principle behind the method is quite simple (Figure 6.2). Once the neurotransmitter candidate has been chemically puriﬁ ed, it is injected under the skin or into the blood- stream of an animal where it stimulates an immune response. (Often, to evoke or enhance the immune response, the molecule is  chemically S T U D Y I N G NE U R O TR A N SM IT T E R SYST EM S \n146 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS coupled to a larger molecule.) One feature of the immune response is the generation of large proteins called antibodies . Antibodies can bind tightly to speciﬁ c sites on the foreign molecule, also known as the antigen —in this case, the transmitter candidate. The best antibodies for immunocy- tochemistry bind very tightly to the transmitter of interest and bind very little or not at all to other chemicals in the brain. These speciﬁ c antibody molecules can be recovered from a blood sample of the immunized ani- mal and chemically tagged with a colorful marker that can be seen with a microscope. When these labeled antibodies are applied to a section of brain tissue, they will color just those cells that contain the transmit- ter candidate (Figure 6.3a). By using several different antibodies, each labeled with a different marker color, it is possible to distinguish several types of cells in the same region of the brain (Figure 6.3b). Immunocytochemistry can be used to localize any molecule for which a speciﬁ c antibody can be generated, including the synthesizing enzymes for transmitter candidates. Demonstration that the transmitter candi- date and its synthesizing enzyme are contained in the same neuron—or better yet, in the same axon terminal—can help satisfy the criterion that the molecule be localized in, and synthesized by, a particular neuron. In Situ Hybridization. The method known as in situ hybridization is also useful for conﬁ rming that a cell synthesizes a particular protein or peptide. Recall from Chapter 2 that proteins are assembled by the ribo- somes according to instructions from speciﬁ c mRNA molecules. There is a unique mRNA molecule for every polypeptide synthesized by a neu- ron. The mRNA transcript consists of the four different nucleic acids linked together in various sequences to form a long strand.

This method uses labeled antibodies to identify the location of molecules within cells.

(b) Blood is withdrawn from the animal, and the antibodies are isolated from the serum. (c) The antibodies are tagged with a visible marker and applied to sections of brain tissue. The antibodies label only those cells that contain the neurotransmitter candidate. (d) A close-up of the complex that includes the neurotransmitter candidates, an antibody, and its visible marker. \n147 CHAPTER 6 NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS acid has the unusual property that it will bind most tightly to one other complementary nucleic acid. Thus, if the sequence of nucleic acids in a strand of mRNA is known, it is possible to construct in the lab a com- plementary strand that will stick, like a strip of Velcro, to the mRNA molecule. The complementary strand is called a probe , and the process by which the probe bonds to the mRNA molecule is called hybridization (Figure 6.4). In order to see if the mRNA for a particular peptide is local- ized in a neuron, we chemically label the appropriate probe so it can be detected, apply it to a section of brain tissue, allow time for the probes to stick to any complementary mRNA strands, then wash away all the extra probes that have not stuck. Finally, we search for neurons that contain the label. To visualize labeled cells after in situ hybridization, the probes can be chemically tagged in several ways. A common approach is to make them radioactive. Because we cannot see radioactivity, hybridized probes are detected by laying the brain tissue on a sheet of special ﬁ lm that is sensitive to radioactive emissions. After exposure to the tissue, the ﬁ lm is developed like a photograph, and negative images of the ra- dioactive cells are visible as clusters of small white dots (Figure 6.5). It is also possible to use digital electronic imaging devices to detect the radioactivity. This technique for viewing the distribution of radioactivity is called autoradiography . An alternative is to label the probes with brightly colorful ﬂ uorescent molecules that can viewed directly with an appropriate microscope. Fluorescence in situ hybridization is also known as FISH. In summary, immunocytochemistry is a method for viewing the loca- tion of speciﬁ c molecules, including proteins, in sections of brain tissue. In situ hybridization is a method for localizing speciﬁ c mRNA transcripts for proteins. Together, these methods enable us to see whether a neuron contains and synthesizes a transmitter candidate and molecules associ- ated with that transmitter.

Strands of mRNA consist of nucleotides arranged in a spe- cific sequence. Each nucleotide will stick to one other complementary nucleotide. In the method of in situ hybridization, a synthetic probe is constructed contain- ing a sequence of complementary nucle- otides that will allow it to stick to the mRNA. If the probe is labeled, the loca- tion of cells containing the mRNA will be revealed. Brain tissue section Strand of mRNA in neuron Radioactively labeled probe with proper sequence of complementary nucleic acids \n148 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS Studying Transmitter Release Once we are satisﬁ ed that a transmitter candidate is synthesized by a neuron and localized to the presynaptic terminal, we must show that it is actually released upon stimulation. In some cases, a speciﬁ c set of cells or axons can be stimulated while taking samples of the ﬂ uids bathing their synaptic targets. The biological activity of the sample can then be tested to see if it mimics the effect of the intact synapses, and then the sample can be chemically analyzed to reveal the structure of the active molecule. This general approach helped Loewi and Dale identify ACh as a transmit- ter at many peripheral synapses. Unlike the peripheral nervous system (PNS), the nervous system out- side the brain and spinal cord studied by Loewi and Dale, most regions of the central nervous system (CNS) contain a diverse mixture of inter- mingled synapses using different neurotransmitters. Until recently, this often made it impossible to stimulate a single population of synapses con- taining only a single neurotransmitter. Researchers had to be content with stimulating many synapses in a region of the brain and collecting and measuring all the chemicals that were released. One way to do this is to use brain slices that are kept alive in vitro . To stimulate release, the slices are bathed in a solution containing a high K \u0002 concentration. This treatment causes a large membrane depolarization (see Figure 3.19), thereby stimulating transmitter release from the axon terminals in the tissue. Because transmitter release requires the entry of Ca 2 \u0002 into the axon terminal, it must also be shown that the release of the neurotrans- mitter candidate from the tissue slice after depolarization occurs only when Ca 2 \u0002 ions are present in the bathing solution. New methods such as optogenetics (see Box 4.2) now make it possible to activate just one speciﬁ c type of synapse at a time. Genetic methods are used to induce one particular population of neurons to express light-sensitive proteins, and then those neurons can be stimulated with brief ﬂ ashes of light that have no effect on the surrounding cells. Any transmitters released are likely to have come from the optogenetically selected type of synapse. Even when it has been shown that a transmitter candidate is released upon depolarization in a calcium-dependent manner, we still cannot be sure that the molecules collected in the ﬂ uids were released from the axon terminals; they may have been released as a secondary con- sequence of synaptic activation. These technical difﬁ culties make the second  criterion—that a transmitter candidate must be released by the presynaptic axon terminal upon stimulation—the most difﬁ cult to satisfy unequivocally in the CNS. Studying Synaptic Mimicry Establishing that a molecule is localized in, synthesized by, and released from a neuron is still not sufﬁ cient to qualify it as a neurotransmitter. A third criterion must be met: The molecule must evoke the same response as that produced by the release of the naturally occurring neurotransmit- ter from the presynaptic neuron. To assess the postsynaptic actions of a transmitter candidate, a method called microiontophoresis is sometimes used. Most neurotransmitter candidates can be dissolved in solutions that will cause them to acquire a net electrical charge. A glass pipette with a very ﬁ ne tip, just a few micrometers across, is ﬁ lled with the ionized solution. The tip of the pipette is carefully positioned next to the postsynaptic membrane of the neuron, and the trans- mitter candidate is ejected in very small amounts by passing electrical cur- rent through the pipette. Neurotransmitter candidates can also be ejected ▲ FIGURE 6.5 In situ hybridization of the mRNA for a peptide neurotransmitter in neurons, visualized with autoradiography. Only neurons with the proper mRNA are labeled, visible here as clusters of white dots. (Source: Courtesy of Dr. S. H. C. Hendry.) \n149 CHAPTER 6 NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS from ﬁ ne pipettes with pulses of high pressure. A microelectrode in the postsynaptic neuron can be used to measure the effects of the transmitter candidate on the membrane potential (Figure 6.6). If iontophoretic or pressure application of the molecule causes elec- trophysiological changes that mimic the effects of transmitter released at the synapse, and if the other criteria of localization, synthesis, and release are met, then the molecule and the transmitter are usually con- sidered to be the same chemical. Studying Receptors Each neurotransmitter exerts its postsynaptic effects by binding to spe- ciﬁ c receptors. As a rule, no two neurotransmitters bind to the same receptor; however, one neurotransmitter can bind to many different receptors. Each of the different receptors a neurotransmitter binds to is called a receptor subtype . For example, in Chapter 5, we learned that ACh acts on two different cholinergic receptor subtypes : One type is pres- ent in skeletal muscle, and the other is in heart muscle. Both subtypes are also present in many other organs and within the CNS. Researchers have tried almost every method of biological and chemical analysis to study the different receptor subtypes of the various neurotrans- mitter systems. Three approaches have proved to be particularly useful: neuropharmacological analysis of synaptic transmission,  ligand-binding methods, and molecular analysis of receptor proteins. Neuropharmacological Analysis. Much of what we know about recep- tor subtypes was ﬁ rst learned using neuropharmacological analysis. For instance, skeletal muscle and heart muscle respond differently to various cholinergic drugs. Nicotine , derived from the tobacco plant, is a receptor Apply drug by passing electrical current through the micropipette Drug-containing micropipette Stimulate axon Presynaptic terminal Postsynaptic dendrite Record V m with microelectrode ▲ FIGURE 6.6 Microiontophoresis. This method enables a researcher to apply drugs or neurotrans- mitter candidates in very small amounts to the surface of neurons. The responses generated by the drug can be compared to those generated by synaptic stimulation. \n150 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS agonist in skeletal muscle but has no effect in the heart. On the other hand, muscarine , derived from a poisonous species of mushroom, has little or no effect on skeletal muscle but is an agonist at the cholinergic recep- tor subtype in the heart. (Recall that ACh slows the heart rate; muscarine is poisonous because it causes a precipitous drop in heart rate and blood pressure.) Thus, two ACh receptor subtypes can be distinguished by the ac- tions of different drugs. In fact, the receptors were given the names of their agonists: nicotinic ACh receptors in skeletal muscle and muscarinic ACh receptors in the heart. Nicotinic and muscarinic receptors also exist in the brain, and some neurons have both types of receptors. Another way to distinguish receptor subtypes is to use selective antag- onists. The South American arrow-tip poison curare inhibits the action of ACh at nicotinic receptors (thereby causing paralysis), and atropine , derived from belladonna plants (also known as deadly nightshade), an- tagonizes ACh at muscarinic receptors (Figure 6.7). (The eye drops an ophthalmologist uses to dilate your pupils are related to atropine.) Different drugs were also used to distinguish several subtypes of gluta- mate receptors, which mediate much of the synaptic excitation in the CNS. Three subtypes are AMPA receptors , NMDA receptors , and kainate receptors , each named for a different chemical agonist. (AMPA stands for \u0003 -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate, and NMDA stands for N -methyl- D -aspartate.) The neurotransmitter glutamate activates all three receptor subtypes, but AMPA acts only at the AMPA receptor, NMDA acts only at the NMDA receptor, and so on (Figure 6.8).

There are three main subtypes of glutamate receptors, each of which binds glutamate and each of which is activated selectively by a  different agonist. \n151 CHAPTER 6 NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS TABLE 6.1 Neurotransmitters, Some Receptors, and Their Pharmacology Neurotransmitter Receptor Subtype Agonist Antagonist Acetylcholine (ACh) Nicotinic receptor Nicotine Curare Muscarinic receptor Muscarine Atropine Norepinephrine (NE) \u0003 receptor Phenylephrine Phenoxybenzamine \u0004 receptor Isoproterenol Propranolol Glutamate (Glu) AMPA AMPA CNQX NMDA NMDA AP5 GABA GABA A Muscimol Bicuculline GABA B Baclofen Phaclofen ATP Adenosine P2X A type ATP Adenosine Suramin Caffeine Similar pharmacological analyses were used to split the NE receptors into two subtypes, \u0003 and \u0004 , and to divide GABA receptors into GABA A and GABA B subtypes. The same can be said for virtually all the neu- rotransmitter systems. Thus, selective drugs have been extremely useful for categorizing receptor subclasses (Table 6.1). In addition, neurophar- macological analysis has been invaluable for assessing the contributions of neurotransmitter systems to brain function. Ligand-Binding Methods. As we said, the ﬁ rst step in studying a neu- rotransmitter system is usually identifying the neurotransmitter. However, with the discovery in the 1970s that many drugs interact selectively with neurotransmitter receptors, researchers realized that they could use these compounds to begin analyzing receptors even before the neurotransmit- ter itself had been identiﬁ ed. The pioneers of this approach were Solomon Snyder and his then student Candace Pert at Johns Hopkins University, who were interested in studying compounds called opiates (Box 6.1). Opiates are a class of drugs, derived from the opium poppy, that are both medically important and commonly abused. Opioids are the broader class of opiate-like chemicals, both natural and synthetic. Their effects include pain relief, euphoria, depressed breathing, and constipation. The question Snyder and Pert originally set out to answer was how heroin, morphine, and other opiates exert their effects on the brain. They and others hypothesized that opiates might be agonists at speciﬁ c receptors in neuronal membranes. To test this idea, they radioactively labeled opiate compounds and applied them in small quantities to neuro- nal membranes that had been isolated from different parts of the brain. If appropriate receptors existed in the membrane, the labeled opiates should bind tightly to them. This is just what they found. The radioactive drugs labeled speciﬁ c sites on the membranes of some, but not all, neu- rons in the brain (Figure 6.9). Following the discovery of opioid recep- tors, the search was on to identify endogenous opioids, or endorphins , the naturally occurring neurotransmitters that act on these receptors. Two peptides called enkephalins were soon isolated from the brain, and they eventually proved to be opioid neurotransmitters. Any chemical compound that binds to a speciﬁ c site on a receptor is called a ligand for that receptor (from the Latin meaning “to bind”). The technique of studying receptors using radioactively or nonradioactively labeled ligands is called the ligand-binding method . Notice that a ligand for a receptor can be an agonist, an antagonist, or the chemical neurotransmitter itself. Speciﬁ c ligands were invaluable for isolating neurotransmitter receptors and determining their chemical structure. ▲ FIGURE 6.9 Opiate receptor binding to a slice of rat brain. Special film was exposed to a brain section that had radioactive opiate receptor ligands bound to it. The dark regions contain more receptors. (Source: Snyder, 1986, p. 44.) \n152 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS L ike so many events in science, identifying the opiate re- ceptors was not simply an intellectual feat accomplished in an ethereal pursuit of pure knowledge. Instead, it all began with President Nixon and his “war on drugs” in 1971, at the height of very well-publicized use of heroin by hundreds of thou- sands of American soldiers in Vietnam. To combat all this, Nixon appointed as czar of drug abuse research Dr. Jerome Jaffe, a psychiatrist who had pioneered in methadone treat- ment for heroin addicts. Jaffe was to coordinate the sev- eral billions of federal dollars in agencies ranging from the Department of Defense to the National Institutes of Health. Jerry, a good friend, pestered me to direct our research toward the “poor soldiers” in Vietnam. So I began wondering how opiates act. The notion that drugs act at receptors, spe- ciﬁ c recognition sites, had been appreciated since the turn of the century. In principle, one could identify such recep- tors simply by measuring the binding of radioactive drugs to tissue membranes. However, countless researchers had ap- plied this strategy to opiates with no success. About this time, a new Johns Hopkins faculty member, Pedro Cuatrecasas, located his laboratory adjacent to mine, and we became fast friends. Pedro had recently attained fame for his discovery of receptors for insulin. His success depended upon seemingly simple but important technical advances. Past efforts to identify receptors for hormones had failed because hormones can bind to many nonspeciﬁ c sites, comprising proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. The numbers of these nonspeciﬁ c sites would likely be millions of times greater than the number of speciﬁ c receptors. To identify the “signal” of insulin receptors binding above the “noise” of nonspeciﬁ c interactions, Pedro developed a simple ﬁ ltration assay. Since insulin should adhere more tightly to its recep- tors than to nonspeciﬁ c sites, he incubated liver membranes with radioactive insulin and poured the mixture over ﬁ lters at- tached to a vacuum that rapidly sucked away the incubation ﬂ uid, leaving the membrane with attached insulin stuck to the ﬁ lters. He then “washed” the ﬁ lters with large volumes of saline, but did this very rapidly so as to preserve insulin bound to receptors while washing away nonspeciﬁ c binding. Despite Pedro’s proximity, it did not immediately occur to me that the insulin success could be transferred to the opi- ate receptor problem. Instead, I had read a paper on nerve growth factor, showing that its amino acid sequence closely resembled that of insulin. Pedro and I soon collaborated in a successful search for the nerve growth factor receptor. Only then did I marshal the courage to extend this approach from proteins such as insulin and nerve growth factor to much smaller molecules such as opiates. Candace Pert, a gradu- ate student in my laboratory, was eager to take on a new research project. We obtained a radioactive drug and moni- tored its binding to brain membranes using Pedro’s magic ﬁ lter machine. The very ﬁ rst experiment, which took only about two hours, was successful. Within a few months, we were able to characterize many features of opiate receptors. Knowing the exact sites where receptors are concentrated in the brain explained all the major actions of opiates, such as euphoria, pain relief, depression of breathing, and pupillary constriction. The properties of opiate receptors resembled very much what one would expect for neurotransmitters. Accordingly, we used similar approaches to search for receptors for neurotransmitters in the brain, and within a few years had identiﬁ ed receptors for most of them. These ﬁ ndings raised an obvious question: Why do opi- ate receptors exist? Humans were not born with morphine in them. Might the opiate receptor be a receptor for a new transmitter that regulates pain perception and emotional states? We and other groups attempted to isolate the hypoth- esized, normally occurring, morphine-like neurotransmitters. John Hughes and Hans Kosterlitz in Aberdeen, Scotland, were the ﬁ rst to succeed. They isolated and obtained the chemical structures of the ﬁ rst “endorphins,” which are called the enkephalins . In our own laboratory, Rabi Simantov and I obtained the structure of the enkephalins soon after the pub- lished success of the Scottish group. From the ﬁ rst experiments identifying opiate receptors until the isolation of the enkephalins, only three years elapsed—an interval of frantic, exhilarating work that changed profoundly how we think about drugs and the brain. P A T H  O F  D I S C O V E R Y BOX 6.1 Finding Opiate Receptors Ligand-binding  methods have been enormously important for mapping the anatomical distribution of different neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. Molecular Analysis. There has been an explosion of information about neurotransmitter receptors in recent decades, thanks to modern methods \n153 CHAPTER 6 NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS for studying protein molecules. Information obtained with these methods has enabled us to divide the neurotransmitter receptor proteins into two groups: transmitter-gated ion channels and G-protein-coupled (metabo- tropic) receptors (see Chapter 5). Molecular neurobiologists have determined the structure of the poly- peptides that make up many proteins, and these studies have led to some startling conclusions. Receptor subtype diversity was expected from the actions of different drugs, but the breadth of the diversity was not ap- preciated until researchers determined how many different polypeptides could serve as subunits of functional receptors. Consider as an example the GABA A receptor, a transmitter-gated chloride channel. Each channel requires ﬁ ve subunits (similar to the ACh-gated ion channel, Figure 5.14), and there are ﬁ ve major classes of subunit proteins, designated \u0003 , \u0004 , \u0005 , \u0006 , and \u0007 . At least six different polypeptides (designated \u0003 1–6) can substitute for one another as an \u0003 subunit. Four different polypeptides (designated \u0004 1–4) can substitute as a \u0004 subunit, and four different polypeptides ( \u0005 1–4) can be used as a \u0005 sub- unit. Although this is not the complete tally, let’s make an interesting cal- culation. If it takes ﬁ ve subunits to form a GABA A receptor-gated channel and there are 15 possible subunits to choose from, then there are 151,887 possible combinations and arrangements of subunits. This means there are at least 151,887 potential subtypes of GABA A receptors! It is important to recognize that the vast majority of the possible sub- unit combinations are never manufactured by neurons, and even if they were, they would not work properly. Nonetheless, it is clear that receptor classiﬁ cations like those appearing in Table 6.1, while still useful, seri- ously underestimate the diversity of receptor subtypes in the brain. NEUROTRANSMITTER CHEMISTRY Research using methods such as those discussed previously has led to the conclusion that the major neurotransmitters are amino acids, amines, and peptides. Evolution is conservative and opportunistic, and it often puts common and familiar things to new uses. This also seems true about the evolution of neurotransmitters. For the most part, they are similar or identical to the basic chemicals of life, the same substances that cells in all species, from bacteria to giraffes, use for metabolism. Amino acids, the building blocks of protein, are essential to life. Most of the known neurotransmitter molecules are either (1) amino acids, (2) amines derived from amino acids, or (3) peptides constructed from amino acids. ACh is one exception, but it is derived from acetyl CoA, a ubiquitous product of cellular respiration in mitochondria, and choline, which is important for fat metabolism throughout the body. Amino acid and amine transmitters are generally each stored in and released by different sets of neurons. The convention established by Dale classiﬁ es neurons into mutually exclusive groups by  neurotransmitter (cholinergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and so on). The idea that a neuron has only one neurotransmitter is often called Dale’s principle . Many peptide-containing neurons violate Dale’s principle because these cells usually release more than one neurotransmitter: an amino acid or amine and a peptide. When two or more transmitters are released from one nerve terminal, they are called co-transmitters . Many examples of neurons with co-transmitters have been identiﬁ ed in recent years, including some that release two small transmitters (e.g., GABA and gly- cine). Nonetheless, most neurons seem to release only a single amino acid N E U R O T R A N SM I T TE R C HE M IS T R Y \n154 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS or amine neurotransmitter, which can be used to assign them to distinct, nonoverlapping classes. Let’s take a look at the biochemical mechanisms that differentiate these neurons. Cholinergic Neurons Acetylcholine (ACh) is the neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction and is therefore synthesized by all the motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem. Other cholinergic cells contribute to the func- tions of speciﬁ c circuits in the PNS and CNS, as we will see in Chapter 15. ACh synthesis requires a speciﬁ c enzyme, choline acetyltransferase ( ChAT ) (Figure 6.10). Like nearly all presynaptic proteins, ChAT is manufactured in the soma and transported to the axon terminal. Only cholinergic neurons contain ChAT, so this enzyme is a good marker for cells that use ACh as a neurotransmitter. Immunohistochemistry with ChAT-speciﬁ c antibodies, for example, can be used to identify cholinergic neurons. ChAT synthesizes ACh in the cytosol of the axon terminal, and the neurotransmitter is concentrated in synaptic vesicles by the actions of a vesicular ACh transporter (Box 6.2). ChAT transfers an acetyl group from acetyl CoA to choline (Figure 6.11a). The source of choline is the extracellular ﬂ uid, where BOX 6.2 Pumping Ions and Transmitters N eurotransmitters may lead an exciting life, but the most mundane part would seem to be the steps that recycle them back from the synaptic cleft and eventually into a vesicle. Where synapses are concerned, the exotic proteins of exo- cytosis and the innumerable transmitter receptors get most of the publicity. Yet, the neurotransmitter transporters are very interesting for at least two reasons: They succeed at an extraordinarily difﬁ cult job, and they are the molecular site at which many important psychoactive drugs act. The hard job of transporters is to pump transmitter mol- ecules across membranes so effectively that they become highly concentrated in very small places. There are two gen- eral types of neurotransmitter transporters. One type, the neuronal membrane transporter, shuttles transmitter from the extracellular ﬂ uid, including the synaptic cleft, and con- centrates it up to 10,000 times higher within the cytosol of the presynaptic terminal. A second type, the vesicular trans- porter , then crams transmitter into vesicles at concentrations that may be 100,000 times higher than in the cytosol. Inside cholinergic vesicles, for example, ACh may reach the incred- ible concentration of 1000 mM, or 1 molar—in other words, about twice the concentration of salt in seawater! How do transporters achieve such dramatic feats of con- centration? Concentrating a chemical is like carrying a weight uphill; both are extremely unlikely to occur unless energy is applied to the task. Recall from Chapter 3 that ion pumps in the plasma membrane use ATP as their source of energy to transport Na \u0002 , K \u0002 , and Ca 2 \u0002 against their concentration B R A I N  F O O D gradients. These ion gradients are essential for setting the resting potential and for powering the ionic currents that un- derlie action and synaptic potentials. Similarly, membranes of synaptic vesicles have pumps that use ATP to fuel the transport of H \u0002 into vesicles. Notice that once ionic gradi- ents are established across a membrane, they can them- selves be tapped as sources of energy. Just as the energy spent in pulling up the weights on a cuckoo clock can be reclaimed to turn the gears and hands of the clock (as the weights slowly fall down again), transporters use transmem- brane gradients of Na \u0002 or H \u0002 as an energy source for moving transmitter molecules up steep concentration gradients. The transporter lets one transmembrane gradient, that of Na \u0002 or H \u0002 , run down a bit in order to build up another gradient, that of the  transmitter. The transporters themselves are large proteins that span membranes. There can be several transporters for one trans- mitter (e.g., at least four subtypes are known for GABA). Figure A shows how they work. Plasma membrane trans- porters use a cotransport mechanism, carrying two Na \u0002 ions along with one transmitter molecule. By contrast, vesicular membrane transporters use a countertransport mechanism that trades a transmitter molecule from the cytosol for a H \u0002 from inside the vesicle. Vesicle membranes have ATP-driven H \u0002 pumps that keep their contents very acidic, or high in pro- tons (i.e., H \u0002 ions). What is the relevance of all this to drugs and disease? Many psychoactive drugs, such as amphetamines and \n155 CHAPTER 6 NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS Presynaptic: GABAergic Postsynaptic membrane Vesicular GABA transporter GABA transporter Glutamate transporter Vesicular glutamate transporter GABA H + 2 2 Presynaptic: Glutamatergic H + Glu Glu GABA Figure A Neurotransmitter transporters. cocaine, potently block certain transporters. By altering the normal recycling process of various transmitters, the drugs lead to chemical imbalances in the brain that can have pro- found effects on mood and behavior. It is also possible that defects in transporters can lead to psychiatric or  neurological disease; certainly, some of the drugs that are therapeuti- cally useful in psychiatry work by blocking transporters. The numerous links between transmitters, drugs, disease, and treatment are tantalizing but complex, and will be discussed further in Chapters 15 and 22. Ach Presynaptic cell Choline transporter ACh transporter Postsynaptic cell ACh receptors ChAT Choline Acetyl CoA Choline + Acetic acid Vesicle ACh ACh AChE + ACh FIGURE 6.10 The life cycle of ACh. \n156 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS it  exists in low  micromolar concentrations. Choline is taken up by the cholinergic axon terminals via a speciﬁ c transporter that requires the cotransport of Na \u0002 to power the movement of choline (see Box 6.2). Because the availability of choline limits how much ACh can be synthe- sized in the axon terminal, the transport of choline into the neuron is said to be the rate-limiting step in ACh synthesis. For certain diseases in which a deﬁ cit in cholinergic synaptic transmission has been noted, dietary supplements of choline are sometimes prescribed to boost ACh levels in the brain. Cholinergic neurons also manufacture the ACh degradative enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) . AChE is secreted into the synaptic cleft and is associated with cholinergic axon terminal membranes. However, AChE is also manufactured by some noncholinergic neurons, so this enzyme is not as useful a marker for cholinergic synapses as ChAT. AChE degrades ACh into choline and acetic acid (Figure 6.11b). This happens very quickly because AChE has one of the fastest catalytic rates among all known enzymes. Much of the resulting choline is taken up by the cholinergic axon terminal via a choline transporter and reused for ACh synthesis (see the red arrow in Figure 6.10). In Chapter 5, we mentioned that AChE is the target of many nerve gases and insecticides. Inhibition of AChE prevents the breakdown of ACh, disrupting transmis- sion at cholinergic synapses on skeletal muscle and heart muscle. Acute effects include marked decreases in heart rate and blood pressure; how- ever, death from the irreversible inhibition of AChE typically results from respiratory paralysis. Catecholaminergic Neurons The amino acid tyrosine is the precursor for three different amine neu- rotransmitters that contain a chemical structure called a catechol (Figure 6.12a). These neurotransmitters are collectively called catechol- amines . The catecholamine neurotransmitters are dopamine (DA) , norepinephrine (NE) , and epinephrine , also called adrenaline (Figure 6.12b). Catecholaminergic neurons are found in regions of the + + + ACh ACh Acetyl CoA Acetic acid O CoA CoA CH 3 C HOCH 2 CH 2 + N(CH 3 ) 3 HOCH 2 CH 2 + N(CH 3 ) 3 OCH 2 CH 2 + N(CH 3 ) 3 Choline Choline Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) Acetylcholinesterase O CH 3 C O CH 3 C OH OCH 2 CH 2 + N(CH 3 ) 3 O CH 3 C (a) (b) ▲ FIGURE 6.11 Acetylcholine.

All catecholaminergic neurons contain the enzyme tyrosine hydroxy- lase (TH) , which catalyzes the ﬁ rst step in catecholamine synthesis, the conversion of tyrosine to a compound called dopa ( L -dihydroxyphenyl- alanine) (Figure 6.13a). The activity of TH is rate limiting for catechol- amine synthesis. The enzyme’s activity is regulated by various signals in the cytosol of the axon terminal. For example, decreased catecholamine release by the axon terminal causes the catecholamine concentration in the cytosol to rise, thereby inhibiting TH. This type of regulation is called end-product inhibition. On the other hand, during periods when catechol- amines are released at a high rate, the elevation in [Ca 2 \u0002 ] i that accom- panies neurotransmitter release triggers an increase in the activity of TH, so transmitter supply keeps up with demand. In addition, prolonged periods of stimulation actually cause the synthesis of more mRNA that codes for the enzyme. Dopa is converted into the neurotransmitter DA by the enzyme dopa decarboxylase (Figure 6.13b). Dopa decarboxylase is abundant in ▲ FIGURE 6.13 The synthesis of catecholamines from tyrosine.

In the movement disorder known as Parkinson’s disease, dopaminergic neurons in the brain slowly degenerate and eventually die. One strategy for treating Parkinson’s disease is the administration of dopa, which causes an increase in DA synthesis in the surviving neurons, increasing the amount of DA avail- able for release. (We will learn more about dopamine and movement in Chapter 14.) Neurons that use NE as a neurotransmitter contain, in addition to TH and dopa decarboxylase, the enzyme dopamine \u0004 -hydroxylase (DBH) , which converts DA to NE (Figure 6.13c). Interestingly, DBH is not found in the cytosol but instead is located within the synaptic vesicles. Thus, in noradrenergic axon terminals, DA is transported from the cytosol to the synaptic vesicles, and there it is made into NE. The last in the line of catecholamine neurotransmitters is epineph- rine (adrenaline). Adrenergic neurons contain the enzyme phentol- amine N -methyltransferase (PNMT) , which converts NE to epinephrine (Figure 6.13d). Curiously, PNMT is in the cytosol of adrenergic axon ter- minals. Thus, NE must ﬁ rst be synthesized in the vesicles and released into the cytosol for conversion into epinephrine, and then the epinephrine must again be transported into vesicles for release. In addition to serving as a neurotransmitter in the brain, epinephrine acts as a hormone when it is released by the adrenal gland into the bloodstream. As we shall see in Chapter 15, circulating epinephrine acts at receptors throughout the body to produce a coordinated visceral response. The catecholamine systems have no fast extracellular degradative enzyme analogous to AChE. Instead, the actions of catecholamines in the synaptic cleft are terminated by selective uptake of the neurotransmitters back into the axon terminal via Na \u0002 -dependent transporters. This step is sensitive to a number of different drugs. For example, amphetamine and cocaine block catecholamine uptake and therefore prolong the actions of the neurotransmitter in the cleft. Once inside the axon terminal, the cat- echolamines may be reloaded into synaptic vesicles for reuse, or they may be enzymatically destroyed by the action of monoamine oxidase (MAO) , an enzyme found on the outer membrane of mitochondria. Serotonergic Neurons The amine neurotransmitter serotonin , also called 5-hydroxytrypta- mine and abbreviated 5-HT , is derived from the amino acid tryptophan. Serotonergic neurons are relatively few in number, but, as we shall see in Part III, they appear to play an important role in the brain systems that regulate mood, emotional behavior, and sleep. The synthesis of serotonin occurs in two steps, just like the synthesis of DA (Figure 6.14). Tryptophan is converted ﬁ rst into an intermediary called 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxy- lase . The 5-HTP is then converted to 5-HT by the enzyme 5-HTP decar- boxylase . Serotonin synthesis appears to be limited by the availability of tryptophan in the extracellular ﬂ uid bathing neurons. The source of brain tryptophan is the blood, and the source of blood tryptophan is the diet (grains, meat, dairy products, and chocolate are particularly rich in tryptophan). Following release from the axon terminal, 5-HT is removed from the synaptic cleft by the action of a speciﬁ c transporter. The process of sero- tonin reuptake, like catecholamine reuptake, is sensitive to a number of different drugs. For example, numerous clinically useful antidepressant \n159 CHAPTER 6 NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS and antianxiety drugs, including ﬂ uoxetine (trade name Prozac), are se- lective inhibitors of serotonin reuptake. Once it is back in the cytosol of the serotonergic axon terminal, the transmitter is either reloaded into synaptic vesicles or degraded by MAO. Amino Acidergic Neurons The amino acids glutamate (Glu) , glycine (Gly) , and gamma-amino- butyric acid (GABA) serve as neurotransmitters at most CNS synapses (Figure 6.15). Of these, only GABA is unique to those neurons that use it as a neurotransmitter; the others are among the 20 amino acids that make up proteins. Glutamate and glycine are synthesized from glucose and other precur- sors by the action of enzymes that exist in all cells. Differences among neurons in the synthesis of these amino acids are therefore quantitative rather than qualitative. For example, the average glutamate concentra- tion in the cytosol of glutamatergic axon terminals has been estimated to be about 20 mM, two or three times higher than that in nonglutamatergic cells. The more important distinction between glutamatergic and nonglu- tamatergic neurons, however, is the transporter that loads the synaptic vesicles. In glutamatergic axon terminals, but not in other types, gluta- mate transporters concentrate glutamate until it reaches a value of about 50 mM in the synaptic vesicles. Because GABA is not one of the 20 amino acids used to construct proteins, it is synthesized in large quantities only by the neurons that use it as a neurotransmitter. The precursor for GABA is glutamate, and the key synthesizing enzyme is glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) (Figure 6.16). GAD, therefore, is a good marker for GABAergic neurons. Immunocytochemical studies have shown that GABAergic neurons are distributed widely in the brain. GABAergic neurons are the major source of synaptic inhibition in the nervous system. Therefore, remarkably, in one chemical step, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain is converted into the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain! The synaptic actions of the amino acid neurotransmitters are termi- nated by selective uptake into the presynaptic terminals and glia, once HO HO Tryptophan CH 2 CHNH 2 Tryptophan hydroxylase 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) 5-Hydroxytryptamine (Serotonin, 5-HT) CH 2 CH 2 NH 2 5-HTP decarboxylase N N COOH COOH CH 2 CHNH 2 N ▲ FIGURE 6.14 The synthesis of serotonin from tryptophan.

Inside the terminal or glial cell, GABA is metabolized by the enzyme GABA transaminase . Other Neurotransmitter Candidates and Intercellular Messengers In addition to the amines and amino acids, a few other small molecules serve as chemical messengers between neurons. One of the most common is adenosine triphosphate (ATP) , a key molecule in cellular metabo- lism (see Figure 2.13). ATP is also a neurotransmitter. It is concentrated in all synaptic vesicles in the CNS and PNS, and it is released into the cleft by presynaptic spikes in a Ca 2 \u0002 -dependent manner, just as the clas- sic transmitters are. ATP is often packaged in vesicles along with another classic transmitter. For example, catecholamine-containing vesicles may have 100 mM of ATP, an enormous quantity, in addition to 400 mM of the catecholamine itself. In this case, the catecholamine and ATP are co-transmitters. ATP also occurs as a co-transmitter with GABA, gluta- mate, ACh, DA, and peptide transmitters in various specialized types of neurons. ATP directly excites some neurons by gating cation channels. In this sense, some of the neurotransmitter functions of ATP are similar to those of glutamate and ACh. ATP binds to purinergic receptors , some of which are transmitter-gated ion channels. There is also a large class of G-protein-coupled purinergic receptors. Following its release from syn- apses, ATP is degraded by extracellular enzymes, yielding adenosine. Adenosine itself does not meet the standard deﬁ nition of a neurotrans- mitter because it is not packaged in vesicles, but it does activate several adenosine-selective receptors. The most interesting discovery about neurotransmitters in the past few years is that small lipid molecules, called endocannabinoids ( endogenous cannabinoids), can be released from postsynaptic neurons and act on presynaptic terminals (Box 6.3). Communication in this direction, from “post” to “pre,” is called retrograde signaling ; thus,  endocannabinoids are retrograde messengers . Retrograde messengers serve as a kind of feed- back system to regulate the conventional forms of synaptic transmission, which of course go from “pre” to “post.” The details about endocannabi- noid signaling are still emerging, but one basic mechanism is now clear (Figure 6.17). Vigorous ﬁ ring of action potentials in the postsynaptic neu- ron causes voltage-gated calcium channels to open, Ca 2 \u0002 enters the cell in large quantities, and intracellular [Ca 2 \u0002 ] rises. The elevated [Ca 2 \u0002 ] then stimulates the synthesis of endocannabinoid molecules from membrane lipids by somehow activating endocannabinoid-synthesizing enzymes. There are several unusual qualities about endocannabinoids: 1. They are not packaged in vesicles like most other neurotransmitters; instead, they are manufactured rapidly and on demand. 2. They are small and membrane permeable; once synthesized, they can diffuse rapidly across the membrane of their cell of origin to contact neighboring cells. 3. They bind selectively to the CB1 type of cannabinoid receptor, which is mainly located on certain presynaptic terminals. CB1 receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors, and their main effect is often to reduce the opening of presynaptic calcium channels. With its cal- cium channels inhibited, the ability of the presynaptic terminal to release its neurotransmitter (usually GABA or glutamate) is impaired. Thus, when a postsynaptic neuron is very active, it releases endocannabinoids, \n161 CHAPTER 6 NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS O F  S P E C I A L  I N T E R E S T BOX 6.3 This Is Your Brain on Endocannabinoids M ost neurotransmitters were discovered long before their receptors, but modern techniques have tended to reverse this tradition. In this story, the receptors were discovered before their transmitters. Cannabis sativa is the botanical name for hemp, a ﬁ brous plant used through the ages for making rope and cloth. These days, cannabis is much more popular as dope than rope. It is widely, and usually illegally, sold as marijuana or hash- ish, although medical uses of cannabis-related compounds are slowly being recognized, and medical or recreational use is being legalized in some states and other parts of the world. The Chinese ﬁ rst recognized the potent psychoactive properties of cannabis 4000 years ago, but Western society learned of its intoxicating properties only in the nineteenth century, when Napoleon III’s troops returned to France with Egyptian hashish. As a member of Napoleon’s Commission of Sciences and Arts reported in 1810, “For the Egyptians, hemp is the plant par excellence, not for the uses they make of it in Europe and many other countries, but for its peculiar effects. The hemp cultivated in Egypt is indeed intoxicating and narcotic” (cited in Piomelli, 2003, p. 873). At low doses, the effects of cannabis can be euphoria, feelings of calm and relaxation, altered sensations, reduced pain, increased laughter, talkativeness, hunger, and light- headedness, as well as decreased problem-solving ability, short-term memory, and psychomotor performance (i.e., the skills necessary for driving). High doses of cannabis can cause profound personality changes and even hal- lucinations. In recent years, forms of cannabis have been approved for limited medicinal use in the United States, primarily to treat nausea and vomiting in cancer patients un- dergoing chemotherapy and to stimulate appetite in some AIDS patients. The active ingredient in cannabis is an oily chemical called \u0002 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol , or THC . During the late 1980s, it became apparent that THC can bind to speciﬁ c G-protein- coupled “cannabinoid” receptors in the brain, particularly in motor control areas, the cerebral cortex, and pain pathways. At about the same time, a group at the National Institute of Mental Health cloned the gene for an unknown (or “orphan”) G-protein-coupled receptor. Further work showed that the mystery receptor was a cannabinoid (CB) receptor. Two types of cannabinoid receptors are known: CB1 receptors are in the brain, and CB2 receptors are mainly in immune tis- sues elsewhere in the body. Remarkably, the brain has more CB1 receptors than any other G-protein-coupled receptor. What are they doing there? We are quite certain they did not evolve to bind the THC from hemp. The natural ligand for a receptor is never the synthetic drug, plant toxin, or snake venom that might have helped us identify that receptor in the ﬁ rst place. It is much more likely that the cannabinoid receptors exist to bind some signaling molecule made naturally by the brain: THC-like neurotransmitters called endocannabinoids . Research has identiﬁ ed two major endocannabinoids: anandamide (from ananda , the Sanskrit word for “internal bliss”) and arachidon- oylglycerol (2-AG). Anandamide and 2-AG are both small lipid molecules (Figure A), quite different from any other known neurotransmitter. As the search for new transmitters continues, the hunt is also on for more selective compounds that bind to the CB receptors. Cannabinoids are potentially useful for relieving nausea, suppressing pain, relaxing muscles, treating sei- zures, and decreasing the intraocular pressure of glaucoma. Antagonists of CB1 receptors have recently been tested as appetite suppressants, but they cause unfortunate side effects. Cannabinoid therapies might be more practical if new drugs can be developed that retain the therapeutic beneﬁ ts without causing psychoactive and other side effects.

This general endocannabinoid mechanism is used throughout the CNS, for a wide range of functions that we don’t completely understand. One of the more exotic chemical messengers to be proposed for inter- cellular communication is actually a gaseous molecule, nitric oxide (NO) . The gases carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulﬁ de (H 2 S) have also been suggested to be messengers in the brain, although evidence for “gasotransmitter” functions is still sparse. These are the same NO, car- bon monoxide, and hydrogen sulﬁ de that are often major air pollutants. NO is synthesized from the amino acid arginine by many cells of the body and has powerful biological effects, particularly in the regulation of blood ﬂ ow. In the nervous system, NO may be another example of a retrograde messenger. Because NO is small and membrane permeable, similar to endocannabinoids, it can diffuse much more freely than most other trans- mitter molecules, even penetrating through one cell to affect another be- yond it. Its inﬂ uence may spread throughout a small region of local tissue, rather than being conﬁ ned to the site of the cells that released it. On the other hand, NO is evanescent and breaks down very rapidly. The functions of gaseous transmitters are being extensively studied and hotly debated.

A chemical may serve dual purposes, mediating communication in the nervous system but doing something entirely different elsewhere. Amino acids, of course, are used to make proteins throughout the body. ATP is the energy source for all cells. NO is released from endothelial cells and causes the smooth muscle of blood vessels to relax. (One consequence in males is penile erection.) The cells with the highest levels of ACh are not in the brain but in the cornea of the eye, where there are no ACh re- ceptors. Likewise, the highest serotonin levels are not in neurons but in blood platelets. These observations underscore the importance of rigorous analysis before a chemical is assigned a neurotransmitter role. The operation of a neurotransmitter system is like a play with two acts. Act I is presynaptic and culminates in the transient elevation of neurotransmitter concentration in the synaptic cleft. We are now ready to move on to Act II, the generation of electrical and biochemical signals in the postsynaptic neuron. The main players are transmitter-gated chan- nels and G-protein-coupled receptors. TRANSMITTER-GATED CHANNELS In Chapter 5, we learned that ACh and the amino acid neurotransmitters mediate fast synaptic transmission by acting on transmitter-gated ion channels. These channels are magniﬁ cent minuscule machines. A single channel can be a sensitive detector of chemicals and voltage, it can regu- late the ﬂ ow of surprisingly large currents with great precision, it can sift and select between very similar ions, and it can be regulated by other receptor systems. Yet each channel is only about 11 nm long, just barely visible with the best computer-enhanced electron microscopic methods. The Basic Structure of Transmitter-Gated Channels The most thoroughly studied transmitter-gated ion channel is the nico- tinic ACh receptor at the neuromuscular junction in skeletal muscle. It is a pentamer, an amalgam of ﬁ ve protein subunits arranged like the staves of a barrel to form a single pore through the membrane (Figure 6.18a). Four different types of polypeptides are used as subunits for the nicotinic receptor, designated \u0003 , \u0004 , \u0005 , and \u0006 . A complete mature channel is made from two \u0003 subunits, and one each of \u0004 , \u0005 , and \u0006 (abbreviated \u0003 2 \u0004 \u0005 \u0006 ). There is one ACh binding site on each of the \u0003 subunits; the simulta- neous binding of ACh to both sites is required for the channel to open (Figure 6.18b). The nicotinic ACh receptor on neurons is also a pentamer, but, unlike the muscle receptor, most of these receptors are composed of \u0003 and \u0004 subunits only (in a ratio of \u0003 3 \u0004 2 ). Although each type of receptor subunit has a different primary struc- ture, there are stretches where the different polypeptide chains have a similar sequence of amino acids. For example, each subunit polypep- tide has four separate segments that will coil into alpha helices (see Figure 6.18a). Because the amino acid residues of these segments are hy- drophobic, the four alpha helices are believed to be where the polypeptide is threaded back and forth across the membrane, similar to the pore loops of potassium and sodium channels (see Chapters 3 and 4). The primary structures of the subunits of other transmitter-gated channels in the brain are also known, and there are obvious similarities T R A N S M I T T E R- G A TE D C HA N N E L S \n164 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS (Figure 6.19). Most contain the four hydrophobic segments that span the membrane in subunits of the nicotinic ACh receptor, the GABA A recep- tor, and the glycine receptor. These three neurotransmitter receptors are all pentameric complexes of subunits (Figure 6.19b). The glutamate-gated channels are slightly different. Glutamate receptors are tetramers, having four subunits that comprise a functional channel. The M2 region of the glu- tamate subunits does not span the membrane but instead forms a hairpin that both enters and exits from the inside of the membrane (Figure 6.19c). The structure of the glutamate receptors resembles that of some potas- sium channels (see Figure 3.17), and this has inspired the surprising hy- pothesis that glutamate receptors and potassium channels evolved from a common ancestral ion channel. The purinergic (ATP) receptors also have an unusual structure. Each subunit has only two membrane-spanning segments, and three subunits make up a complete  receptor. The most interesting variations among channel structures are the ones that account for their differences. Different transmitter binding sites let one channel respond to Glu while another responds to GABA; certain amino acids around the narrow ion pore allow only Na \u0002 and K \u0002 to ﬂ ow through some channels, Ca 2 \u0002 through others, and only Cl \b through yet others. Amino Acid-Gated Channels Amino acid-gated channels mediate most of the fast synaptic transmis- sion in the CNS. Let’s take a closer look at their functions because they are central to topics as diverse as sensory systems, memory, and disease. Several properties of these channels distinguish them from one another and deﬁ ne their functions within the brain. • The pharmacology of their binding sites describes which transmitters affect them and how drugs interact with them. • The kinetics of the transmitter binding process and channel gating determine the duration of their effect.

All of these properties are a direct result of the molecular structure of the channels. Glutamate-Gated Channels. As we discussed previously, three gluta- mate receptor subtypes bear the names of their selective agonists: AMPA, NMDA, and kainate. Each of these is a glutamate-gated ion channel. The AMPA-gated and NMDA-gated channels mediate the bulk of fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain.

They have in common the four regions called M1 to M4 , which are segments where the polypeptides will coil into alpha helices to span the membrane.

AMPA-gated channels are permeable to both Na \u0002 and K \u0002 , and most of them are not permeable to Ca 2 \u0002 . The net effect of activating them at nor- mal, negative membrane potentials is to admit an excess of cations into the cell (i.e., more Na \u0002 enters than K \u0002 leaves), causing a rapid and large depolarization. Thus, AMPA receptors at CNS synapses mediate excit- atory transmission in much the same way as nicotinic receptors mediate synaptic excitation at neuromuscular junctions. AMPA receptors coexist with NMDA receptors at many synapses in the brain, so most glutamate-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) have components contributed by both (Figure 6.20). NMDA- gated channels also cause excitation of a cell by admitting an excess of Na \u0002 , but they differ from AMPA receptors in two very important ways: (1) NMDA-gated channels are permeable to Ca 2 \u0002 , and (2) inward ionic cur- rent through NMDA-gated channels is voltage dependent. We’ll discuss each of these properties in turn. It is hard to overstate the importance of intracellular Ca 2 \u0002 to cell func- tions. We have already seen that Ca 2 \u0002 can trigger presynaptic neurotrans- mitter release. Postsynaptically, Ca 2 \u0002 can also activate many enzymes, regulate the opening of a variety of channels, and affect gene expression; in excessive amounts, Ca 2 \u0002 can even trigger the death of a cell (Box 6.4). Thus, activation of NMDA receptors can, in principle, cause widespread and lasting changes in the postsynaptic neuron. Indeed, as we will see in Chapter 25, Ca 2 \u0002 entry through NMDA-gated channels may cause the changes that lead to long-term memory.

One of the fascinating ironies of neuronal life and death is that glutamate, the most essential neurotransmitter in the brain, is also a common killer of neurons. A large percentage of the brain’s synapses release glutamate, which is stored in large quantities. Even the cytosol of nonglutamatergic neu- rons has a very high glutamate concentration, greater than 3 mM. An ominous observation is that when you apply this same amount of glutamate to the outside of isolated neurons, they die within minutes. Mae West once said, “Too much of a good thing can be wonderful,” but apparently she wasn’t talking about glutamate. The voracious metabolic rate of the brain demands a con- tinuous supply of oxygen and glucose. If blood ﬂ ow ceases, as in cardiac arrest, neural activity will stop within seconds, and permanent damage will result within a few minutes. Disease states such as cardiac arrest, stroke, brain trauma, seizures, and oxygen deﬁ ciency can initiate a vicious cycle of excess glutamate release. Whenever neurons cannot gener- ate enough ATP to keep their ion pumps working hard, mem- branes depolarize, and Ca 2 \u0002 leaks into cells. The entry of Ca 2 \u0002 triggers the synaptic release of glutamate. Glutamate further depolarizes neurons, which further raises intracellular Ca 2 \u0002 and causes still more glutamate to be released. At this point, there may even be a reversal of the glutamate transporter, further contributing to the cellular leakage of glutamate. When glutamate reaches high concentrations, it kills neu- rons by overexciting them, a process called excitotoxicity . Glutamate simply activates its several types of receptors, which allow excessive amounts of Na \u0002 , K \u0002 , and Ca 2 \u0002 to ﬂ ow across the membrane. The NMDA subtype of the glutamate- gated channel is a critical player in excitotoxicity because it is the main route for Ca 2 \u0002 entry. Neuron damage or death occurs because of swelling resulting from water uptake and stimula- tion by Ca 2 \u0002 of intracellular enzymes that degrade proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Neurons literally digest themselves. Excitotoxicity has been implicated in several progressive neurodegenerative human diseases such as amyotrophic lat- eral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig disease), in which spinal motor neurons slowly die, and Alzheimer’s dis- ease , in which brain neurons slowly die. The effects of various environmental toxins mimic aspects of these diseases. Eating large quantities of a certain type of chickpea can cause lath- yrism, a degeneration of motor neurons. The pea contains an excitotoxin called \u0003 -oxalylaminoalanine , which activates glutamate receptors. A toxin called domoic acid , found in contaminated shellﬁ sh, is also a glutamate receptor agonist. Ingesting small amounts of domoic acid causes seizures and brain damage. And another plant excitotoxin, \u0004 -methylami- noalanine, may cause a hideous condition that combines signs of ALS, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease in individual patients on the island of Guam. As researchers sort out the tangled web of excitotoxins, receptors, enzymes, and neurological disease, new strate- gies for treatment emerge. Glutamate receptor antagonists that can obstruct these excitotoxic cascades and minimize neuronal suicide have shown some clinical promise. Genetic manipulations may eventually thwart neurodegenerative con- ditions in susceptible people. When the NMDA-gated channel opens, Ca 2 \u0002 and Na \u0002 enter the cell (and K \u0002 leaves), but the magnitude of this inward ionic current depends on the postsynaptic membrane potential in an unusual way, for an un- usual reason. When glutamate binds to the NMDA receptor, the pore opens as usual. However, at normal negative resting membrane poten- tials, the channel becomes clogged by Mg 2 \u0002 ions, and this “magnesium block” prevents other ions from passing freely through the NMDA chan- nel. Mg 2 \u0002 pops out of the pore only when the membrane is depolarized, which usually follows the activation of AMPA channels at the same and neighboring synapses. Thus, inward ionic current through the NMDA channel is voltage dependent , in addition to being transmitter gated. Both glutamate and depolarization must coincide before the channel will pass current (Figure 6.21). This property has a signiﬁ cant impact on synaptic integration at many locations in the CNS. GABA-Gated and Glycine-Gated Channels. GABA mediates most syn- aptic inhibition in the CNS, and glycine mediates most of the rest. Both the GABA A receptor and the glycine receptor gate a chloride channel. \n168 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS GABA-gated Cl – channel (GABA A receptor) Benzodiazepine Ethanol Barbiturate Neurosteroids GABA FIGURE 6.22 The binding of drugs to the GABA A receptor.

(b) Depolar- ization of the membrane relieves the Mg 2 \u0002 block and allows Na \u0002 and Ca 2 \u0002 to enter. Surprisingly, inhibitory GABA A and glycine receptors have a structure very similar to that of excitatory nicotinic ACh receptors, despite the fact that the ﬁ rst two are selective for anions while the last is selective for cat- ions. Each receptor has \u0003 subunits that bind the transmitter and \u0004 sub- units that do not. Synaptic inhibition must be tightly regulated in the brain. Too much causes a loss of consciousness and coma; too little leads to a seizure. The need to control inhibition may explain why the GABA A receptor has, in addition to its GABA binding site, several other sites where chemicals can dramatically modulate its function. For example, two classes of drugs, ben- zodiazepines (such as the tranquilizer diazepam, with the trade name Valium) and barbiturates (including phenobarbital and other sedatives and anticonvulsants), each bind to their own distinct site on the outside face of the GABA A channel (Figure 6.22). By themselves, these drugs do very little to the channel. But when GABA is present, benzodiazepines in- crease the frequency of channel openings, while barbiturates increase the duration of channel openings. The result in each case is more inhibitory Cl \b current, stronger inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), and the behavioral consequences of enhanced inhibition. The actions of benzodiaze- pines and barbiturates are selective for the GABA A receptor, and the drugs have no effect on glycine receptor function. Some of this selectivity can be understood in molecular terms; only receptors with the \u0005 type of GABA A subunit, in addition to \u0003 and \u0004 subunits, respond to benzodiazepines. Another popular drug that strongly enhances the function of the GABA A receptor is ethanol, the form of alcohol imbibed in beverages. Ethanol has complex actions that include effects on NMDA, glycine, nico- tinic ACh, and serotonin receptors. Its effects on GABA A channels depend on their speciﬁ c structure. Evidence indicates that particular \u0003 , \u0004 , and \u0005 subunits are necessary for constructing an ethanol-sensitive GABA A receptor, similar to the structure that is benzodiazepine sensitive. This explains why ethanol enhances inhibition in some brain areas but not others. By understanding this molecular and anatomical speciﬁ city, we can begin to appreciate how drugs like ethanol lead to such powerful, and addictive, effects on behavior. These myriad drug effects present an interesting paradox. Surely, the GABA A receptor did not evolve modulatory binding sites just for the beneﬁ t of our modern drugs. The paradox has motivated researchers to search for endogenous ligands, natural chemicals that might bind to ben- zodiazepine and barbiturate sites and serve as regulators of inhibition. \n169 CHAPTER 6 NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS Substantial evidence indicates that natural benzodiazepine-like ligands exist, although identifying them and understanding their functions are proving difﬁ cult. Other good candidates as natural modulators of GABA A receptors are the neurosteroids , natural metabolites of steroid hormones that are synthesized from cholesterol primarily in the gonads and adrenal glands, but also in glial cells of the brain. Some neurosteroids enhance inhibitory function while others suppress it, and they seem to do both by binding to their own sites on the GABA A receptor (see Figure 6.22), distinct from those of the other drugs we’ve mentioned. The functions of natural neurosteroids are also obscure, but they suggest a means by which brain and body physiology could be regulated in parallel by the same chemicals. G-PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS AND EFFECTORS There are multiple subtypes of G-protein-coupled receptors in every known neurotransmitter system. In Chapter 5, we learned that trans- mission at these receptors involves three steps: (1) binding of the neu- rotransmitter to the receptor protein, (2) activation of G-proteins, and (3)  activation of effector systems. Let’s focus on each of these steps. The Basic Structure of G-Protein-Coupled Receptors Most G-protein-coupled receptors are simple variations on a common plan, consisting of a single polypeptide containing seven membrane-spanning alpha helices (Figure 6.23). Two of the extracellular loops of the polypep- tide form the transmitter binding sites. Structural variations in this re- gion determine which neurotransmitters, agonists, and antagonists bind to the receptor. Two of the intracellular loops can bind to and activate G-proteins. Structural variations here determine which G-proteins and, consequently, which effector systems are activated in response to trans- mitter binding. A very partial list of G-protein-coupled receptors appears in Table 6.2. The human genome has genes coding for about 800 different G-protein- coupled receptors, which are organized into ﬁ ve major families with G - P R O T EI N - C O U P LE D R EC EP T O R S AN D E F F E C T O R S G-protein Membrane- spanning alpha helix G-protein-coupled receptor Extracellular side Intracellular side Neurotransmitter Neurotransmitter binding site ▲ FIGURE 6.23 The basic structure of a G-protein-coupled receptor. Most metabotropic re- ceptors have seven membrane-spanning alpha helices, a transmitter binding site on the extracellular side, and a G-protein binding site on the intracellular side. \n170 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS similar structures. Most of these receptors were unknown before the pow- erful methods of molecular biology were applied to their discovery. It is also important to recall that G-protein-coupled receptors are important in all of the body’s cell types, not just neurons. The Ubiquitous G-Proteins G-proteins are the common link in most signaling pathways that start with a neurotransmitter receptor and end with effector proteins. G-protein is short for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding protein, which is actu- ally a diverse family of about 20 types. There are many more transmitter receptors than G-proteins, so some types of G-proteins can be activated by many receptors. Most G-proteins have the same basic mode of operation (Figure 6.24): 1. Each G-protein has three subunits, termed \u0003 , \u0004 , and \u0005 . In the resting state, a guanosine diphosphate (GDP) molecule is bound to the G \u0003 sub- unit, and the whole complex ﬂ oats around on the inner surface of the membrane. 2. If this GDP-bound G-protein bumps into the proper type of receptor and if that receptor has a transmitter molecule bound to it, then the G-protein releases its GDP and exchanges it for a GTP that it picks up from the cytosol. 3. The activated GTP-bound G-protein splits into two parts: the G \u0003 sub- unit plus GTP and the G \u0004 \u0005 complex. Both can then move on to inﬂ uence various effector proteins. 4. The G \u0003 subunit is itself an enzyme that eventually breaks down GTP into GDP. Therefore, G \u0003 eventually terminates its own activity by con- verting the bound GTP to GDP. 5. The G \u0003 and G \u0004 \u0005 subunits come back together, allowing the cycle to begin again. The ﬁ rst G-proteins that were discovered had the effect of stimulating effector proteins. Subsequently, it was found that other G-proteins could inhibit these same effectors. Thus, the simplest scheme for subdividing the G-proteins is G S , designating that the G-protein is stimulatory, and G i , designating that the G-protein is inhibitory. G-Protein-Coupled Effector Systems In Chapter 5, we learned that activated G-proteins exert their effects by binding to either of two types of effector proteins: G-protein-gated ion channels and G-protein-activated enzymes. Because the effects do not TABLE 6.2 Some G-Protein-Coupled Neurotransmitter Receptors Neurotransmitter Receptors Acetylcholine (ACh) Muscarinic receptors (M 1 , M 2 , M 3 , M 4 , M 5 ) Glutamate (Glu) Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1–8) GABA GABA B1 , GABA B2 Serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 1B , 5-HT 1D , 5-HT 1E , 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 4 , 5-HT 5A Dopamine (DA) D1, D2, D3, D4, D5 Norepinephrine (NE) \u0003 1 , \u0003 2 , \u0004 1 , \u0004 2 , \u0004 3 Opioids , \u0006 , Cannabinoid CB1, CB2 ATP P2Y 2 , P2Y 11 , P2T, P2U Adenosine A 1 , A 2A , A 2B , A 3 \n171 CHAPTER 6 NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS involve any other chemical intermediaries, the ﬁ rst route is sometimes called the shortcut pathway . The Shortcut Pathway. A variety of neurotransmitters use the short- cut pathway, from receptor to G-protein to ion channel. One example is the muscarinic receptors in the heart. These ACh receptors are coupled via G-proteins to particular types of potassium channels, explaining why ACh slows the heart rate (Figure 6.25). In this case, the \u0004 \u0005 subunits migrate laterally along the membrane until they bind to the right type of potassium channel and induce it to open. Another example is neuro- nal GABA B receptors, also coupled by the shortcut pathway to potassium channels.

(c) The activated G-protein splits, and both the G \u0003 (GTP) subunit and the G \u0004\u0005 subunit become available to activate effector proteins. (d) The G \u0003 subunit slowly removes phosphate (PO 4 ) from GTP, con- verting GTP to GDP and terminating its own activity. \n172 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS Shortcut pathways are the fastest of the G-protein-coupled systems, having responses beginning within 30–100 msec of neurotransmit- ter binding. Although not quite as fast as a transmitter-gated channel, which uses no intermediary between receptor and channel, this is faster than the second messenger cascades we describe next. The shortcut path- way is also very localized compared with other effector systems. As the G-protein diffuses within the membrane, it apparently cannot move very far, so only channels nearby can be affected. Because all the action in the shortcut pathway occurs within the membrane, it is sometimes called the membrane-delimited pathway . Second Messenger Cascades. G-proteins can also exert their effects by directly activating certain enzymes. Activation of these enzymes can trig- ger an elaborate series of biochemical reactions, a cascade that often ends in the activation of other “downstream” enzymes that alter neuronal func- tion. Between the ﬁ rst enzyme and the last are several second messengers . The whole process that couples the neurotransmitter, via multiple steps, to activation of a downstream enzyme is called a second  messenger cascade (Figure 6.26). In Chapter 5, we introduced the cAMP second messenger cascade initi- ated by the activation of the NE \u0004 receptor (Figure 6.27a). It begins with the \u0004 receptor activating the stimulatory G-protein, G S , which proceeds to stimulate the membrane-bound enzyme adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP to cAMP. The subsequent rise of cAMP in the cytosol activates a speciﬁ c downstream enzyme called protein kinase A (PKA) . Many biochemical processes are regulated with a push–pull method, one to stimulate them and one to inhibit them, and cAMP production is no exception.

G i suppresses the activity of adenylyl cyclase, and this effect can take prece- dence over the stimulatory system (Figure 6.27b). Some messenger cascades can branch. Figure 6.28 shows how the acti- vation of various G-proteins can stimulate phospholipase C (PLC) , an enzyme that ﬂ oats in the membrane-like adenylyl cyclase. PLC acts on a membrane phospholipid (PIP 2 , or phosphatidylinositol-4, 5- bisphosphate), splitting it to form two molecules that serve as second messengers: diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP 3 ) . DAG, which is lipid-soluble, stays within the plane of the membrane where it activates a downstream enzyme, protein kinase C (PKC) . At the same time, the water-soluble IP 3 diffuses away in the cytosol and binds to speciﬁ c receptors on the smooth ER and other membrane-enclosed or- ganelles in the cell. These receptors are IP 3 -gated calcium channels, so Activation of downstream enzyme Secondary chemical reactions Neurotransmitter Receptor G-protein Membrane-bound enzyme FIGURE 6.26 The components of a second messenger cascade. – + + NE Adenylyl cyclase Inhibitory \u0003 2 receptor NE Protein kinase A (a) (b) Stimulatory \u0002 receptor Stimulatory G-protein (G s ) Inhibitory G-protein (G i ) ▲ FIGURE 6.27 The stimulation and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by different G-proteins.

(b) Binding of NE to the \u0003 2 receptor activates G i , which inhibits adenylyl cyclase. \n174 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS IP 3 causes the organelles to discharge their stores of Ca 2 \u0002 . As we have said, elevations in cytosolic Ca 2 \u0002 can trigger widespread and long-lasting effects. One effect is activation of the enzyme calcium-calmodulin-de- pendent protein kinase , or CaMK . CaMK is an enzyme implicated in, among other things, the molecular mechanisms of memory, as we’ll see in Chapter 25. Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation. The preceding examples show that key downstream enzymes in many of the second messenger cas- cades are protein kinases (PKA, PKC, CaMK). As mentioned in Chapter 5, protein kinases transfer phosphate from ATP ﬂ oating in the cytosol to proteins, a reaction called phosphorylation. The addition of phosphate groups to a protein changes its conformation slightly, thereby changing its biological activity. The phosphorylation of ion channels, for example, can strongly inﬂ uence the probability that they will open or close. Consider the consequence of activating the \u0004 type of NE receptors on cardiac muscle cells. The subsequent rise in cAMP activates PKA, which phosphorylates the cell’s voltage-gated calcium channels, and this enhances their activity. More Ca 2 \u0002 ﬂ ows, and the heart beats more strongly. By contrast, the stimulation of \u0004 -adrenergic receptors in many neurons seems to have no effect on calcium channels, but instead causes inhibition of certain potassium channels. Reduced K \u0002 conductance causes a slight depolarization, increases the length constant, and makes the neuron more excitable (see Chapter 5). If transmitter-stimulated kinases were allowed to phosphorylate with- out some method of reversing the process, all proteins would quickly be- come saturated with phosphates, and further regulation would become impossible. Enzymes called protein phosphatases save the day because they act rapidly to remove phosphate groups. The degree of channel phos- phorylation at any moment therefore depends on the dynamic balance of phosphorylation by kinases and dephosphorylation by phosphatases (Figure 6.29).

What are the advan- tages of  having such long chains of command? One important advan- tage is signal ampliﬁ cation : The activation of one G-protein-coupled receptor can lead to the activation of not one, but many, ion channels (Figure 6.30). Signal ampliﬁ cation can occur at several places in the cascade. A single neurotransmitter molecule, bound to one receptor, can acti- vate perhaps 10–20 G-proteins; each G-protein can activate an ade- nylyl cyclase, which can make many cAMP molecules that can spread to  activate many kinases. Each kinase can then phosphorylate many channels. If all cascade components were tied together in a clump, sig- naling would be severely limited. The use of small messengers that can diffuse quickly (such as cAMP) also allows signaling at a distance, over a wide stretch of cell membrane. Signal cascades also provide many sites for further regulation, as well as interaction between cas- cades. Finally, signal cascades can generate very long-lasting chemical changes in cells, which may form the basis for, among other things, a lifetime of  memories. FIGURE 6.30 Signal amplification by G-protein- coupled second messenger cascades. When a transmitter acti- vates a G-protein-coupled receptor, there can be amplification of the messengers at several stages of the cascade, so that ultimately, many channels are affected.

But this is only part of the story because any single neurotransmitter can have many dif- ferent effects. A molecule of glutamate can bind to any of several kinds of glutamate receptors, and each of these can mediate a different response. The ability of one transmitter to activate more than one subtype of re- ceptor, and cause more than one type of postsynaptic response, is called divergence . Divergence is the rule among neurotransmitter systems. Every known neurotransmitter can activate multiple receptor subtypes (see Table 6.2), and evidence indicates that the number of known receptors will continue to escalate as the powerful methods of molecular neurobiology are applied to each system. Because of the multiple receptor subtypes, one transmit- ter can  affect different neurons (or even different parts of the same neu- ron) in very different ways. Divergence also occurs at points beyond the receptor level, depending on which G-proteins and which effector systems are  activated. Divergence may occur at any stage in the cascade of trans- mitter effects (Figure 6.31a).

Multiple transmitters, each activating their own receptor type, can converge to inﬂ uence the same effector system (Figure 6.31b). Convergence in a single cell can occur at the level of the G-protein, the second messen- ger cascade, or the type of ion channel. Neurons integrate divergent and convergent signaling systems, resulting in a complex map of chemical effects (Figure 6.31c). The wonder is that it ever works; the challenge is to  understand how it does. CONCLUDING REMARKS Neurotransmitters are the essential links between neurons, and between neurons and other effector cells, such as muscle cells and glandular cells. But it is important to think of transmitters as one link in a chain of events, inciting chemical changes both fast and slow, divergent and convergent. You can envision the many signaling pathways onto and within a single neuron as a kind of information network. This network is in delicate bal- ance, shifting its effects dynamically as the demands on a neuron vary with changes in the organism’s behavior. The signaling network within a single neuron resembles in some ways the neural networks of the brain itself. It receives a variety of inputs, in the form of transmitters bombarding it at different times and places. These inputs cause an increased drive through some signal pathways and a decreased drive through others, and the information is recombined to yield a particular output that is more than a simple summation of the in- puts. Signals regulate signals, chemical changes can leave lasting traces of their history, drugs can shift the balance of signaling power—and, in a literal sense, the brain and its chemicals are one.

Now we are ready to assemble them into a nervous system that sees, hears, feels, moves, remembers, and dreams. Just as an un- derstanding of neuronal structure is necessary for understanding neuro- nal function, we must understand nervous system structure in order to understand brain function. Neuroanatomy has challenged generations of students—and for good reason: The human brain is extremely complicated. However, our brain is merely a variation on a plan that is common to the brains of all mammals (Figure 7.1). The human brain appears complicated because it is distorted as a result of the selective growth of some parts within the conﬁ nes of the skull. But once the basic mammalian plan is understood, these specializa- tions of the human brain become clear. We begin by introducing the general organization of the mammalian brain and the terms used to describe it. Then we take a look at how the three-dimensional structure of the brain arises during embryological and fetal development. Following the course of development makes it easier to understand how the parts of the adult brain ﬁ t together. Finally, we explore the cerebral neocortex, a structure that is unique to mammals and proportionately the largest in humans. An Illustrated Guide to Human Neuroanatomy follows the chapter as an appendix. The neuroanatomy presented in this chapter provides the canvas on which we will paint the sensory and motor systems in Chapters 8–14. Because you will encounter a lot of new terms, self-quizzes within this chapter provide an opportunity for review. GROSS ORGANIZATION OF THE MAMMALIAN NERVOUS SYSTEM The nervous system of all mammals has two divisions: the central ner- vous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Here we identify some of the important components of the CNS and the PNS. We also discuss the membranes that surround the brain and the ﬂ uid-ﬁ lled ventricles within the brain. We’ll then explore some new methods of ex- amining the structure of the brain. But ﬁ rst, we need to review some anatomical terminology. Anatomical References Getting to know your way around the brain is like getting to know your way around a city. To describe your location in the city, you would use points of reference such as north, south, east, and west and up and down. The same is true for the brain, except that the terms—called anatomical references —are different. Consider the nervous system of a rat (Figure 7.2a). We begin with the rat because it is a simpliﬁ ed version that has all the general features of mammalian nervous system organization. In the head lies the brain, and the spinal cord runs down inside the backbone toward the tail. The direc- tion, or anatomical reference, pointing toward the rat’s nose is known as anterior or rostral (from the Latin for “beak”). The direction pointing toward the rat’s tail is posterior or caudal (from the Latin for “tail”). The direction pointing up is known as dorsal (from the Latin for “back”), and the direction pointing down is ventral (from the Latin for “belly”).

Despite differences in complexity, the brains of all these spe- cies have many features in common. The brains have been drawn to appear ap- proximately the same size; their relative sizes are shown in the inset on the left. \n182 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS Thus, the rat spinal cord runs anterior to posterior. The top side of the spinal cord is the dorsal side, and the bottom side is the ventral side. If we look down on the nervous system, we see that it may be divided into two equal halves (Figure 7.2b). The right side of the brain and spinal cord is the mirror image of the left side. This characteristic is known as bilateral symmetry . With just a few exceptions, most structures within the nervous system come in pairs, one on the right side and the other on the left. The invisible line running down the middle of the nervous system is called the midline , and this gives us another way to describe anatomi- cal references. Structures closer to the midline are medial ; structures farther away from the midline are lateral . In other words, the nose is medial to the eyes, the eyes are medial to the ears, and so on. In addi- tion, two structures that are on the same side are said to be ipsilateral to each other; for example, the right ear is ipsilateral to the right eye. If the structures are on opposite sides of the midline, they are said to be contralateral to each other; the right ear is contralateral to the left ear. To view the internal structure of the brain, it is usually necessary to slice it up. In the language of anatomists, a slice is called a section ; to slice is to section . Although one could imagine an inﬁ nite number of ways we might cut into the brain, the standard approach is to make cuts parallel to one of the three anatomical planes of section. The plane of the section resulting from splitting the brain into equal right and left halves is called the midsagittal plane (Figure 7.3a). Sections parallel to the midsagittal plane are in the sagittal plane . The two other anatomical planes are perpendicular to the sagittal plane and to one another. The horizontal plane is parallel to the ground (Figure 7.3b). A single section in this plane could pass through both the eyes and the ears. Thus, horizontal sections split the brain into dorsal and ventral parts. The coronal plane is perpendicular to the ground and to the sagittal plane (Figure 7.3c). A single section in this plane could pass through both eyes or both ears but not through all four at the same time. Thus, the coronal plane splits the brain into anterior and posterior parts.

The brain lies entirely within the skull. A side view of the rat brain reveals three parts that are common to all mammals: the cerebrum, the cerebel- lum, and the brain stem (Figure 7.4a). The Cerebrum. The rostral-most and largest part of the brain is the cerebrum . Figure 7.4b shows the rat cerebrum as it appears when viewed from above. Notice that it is clearly split down the middle into two cerebral hemispheres , separated by the deep sagittal ﬁ ssure . In general, the right cerebral hemisphere receives sensations from, and controls movements of, the left side of the body. Similarly, the left cerebral hemisphere is concerned with sensations and movements on the right side of the body. The Cerebellum. Lying behind the cerebrum is the cerebellum (the word is derived from the Latin for “little brain”). While the cerebellum is in fact dwarfed by the large cerebrum, it actually contains as many neu- rons as both cerebral hemispheres combined. The cerebellum is primarily a movement control center that has extensive connections with the cere- brum and the spinal cord. In contrast to the cerebral hemispheres, the left side of the cerebellum is concerned with movements of the left side of the body, and the right side of the cerebellum is concerned with movements of the right side. The Brain Stem. The remaining part of the brain is the brain stem, best observed in a midsagittal view of the brain (Figure 7.4c). The brain stem forms the stalk from which the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum sprout. The brain stem is a complex nexus of ﬁ bers and cells that in part serves to relay information from the cerebrum to the spinal cord and cer- ebellum, and vice versa. However, the brain stem is also the site where vital functions are regulated, such as breathing, consciousness, and the control of body temperature. Indeed, while the brain stem is considered the most primitive part of the mammalian brain, it is also the most im- portant to life. One can survive damage to the cerebrum and cerebellum, but damage to the brain stem is usually fatal. The Spinal Cord. The spinal cord is encased in the bony vertebral column and is attached to the brain stem. The spinal cord is the major conduit of Side (lateral) view: Top (dorsal) view: Midsagittal view: Sagittal fissure (a) (b) (c) Cerebrum Cerebellum Brain stem Brain stem Right cerebral hemisphere Spinal cord Left cerebral hemisphere FIGURE 7.4 The brain of a rat. (a) Side (lateral) view. (b) Top (dorsal) view. (c) Midsagittal view. \n184 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS information from the skin, joints, and muscles of the body to the brain, and vice versa. A transection of the spinal cord results in anesthesia (lack of feeling) in the skin and paralysis of the muscles in parts of the body caudal to the cut. Paralysis in this case does not mean that the muscles cannot function, but they cannot be controlled by the brain. The spinal cord communicates with the body via the spinal nerves , which are part of the peripheral nervous system (discussed below). Spinal nerves exit the spinal cord through notches between each vertebra of the vertebral column. Each spinal nerve attaches to the spinal cord by means of two branches, the dorsal root and the ventral root (Figure 7.5). Recall from Chapter 1 that François Magendie showed that the dorsal root contains axons bringing information into the spinal cord, such as those that signal the accidental entry of a thumbtack into your foot (see Figure 3.1). Charles Bell showed that the ventral root contains axons car- rying information away from the spinal cord—for example, to the muscles that jerk your foot away in response to the pain of the thumbtack. The Peripheral Nervous System All the parts of the nervous system other than the brain and spinal cord comprise the peripheral nervous system (PNS) . The PNS has two parts: the somatic PNS and the visceral PNS. The Somatic PNS. All the spinal nerves that innervate the skin, the joints, and the muscles that are under voluntary control are part of the somatic PNS . The somatic motor axons, which command muscle contraction, de- rive from motor neurons in the ventral spinal cord. The cell bodies of the motor neurons lie within the CNS, but their axons are mostly in the PNS. The somatic sensory axons, which innervate and collect information from the skin, muscles, and joints, enter the spinal cord via the dor- sal roots. The cell bodies of these neurons lie outside the spinal cord in Dorsal roots Dorsal root ganglia Ventral roots Spinal nerves ▲ FIGURE 7.5 The spinal cord. The spinal cord runs inside the vertebral column. Axons enter and exit the spinal cord via the dorsal and ventral roots, respectively. These roots come together to form the spinal nerves that course through the body. \n185 CHAPTER 7 THE STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM clusters called dorsal root ganglia . There is a dorsal root ganglion for each spinal nerve (see Figure 7.5). The Visceral PNS. The visceral PNS , also called the involuntary, vegeta- tive, or autonomic nervous system (ANS) , consists of the neurons that innervate the internal organs, blood vessels, and glands. Visceral sensory axons bring information about visceral function to the CNS, such as the pressure and oxygen content of the blood in the arteries. Visceral motor ﬁ bers command the contraction and relaxation of muscles that form the walls of the intestines and the blood vessels (called smooth muscles ), the rate of cardiac muscle contraction, and the secretory function of various glands. For example, the visceral PNS controls blood pressure by regulat- ing the heart rate and the diameter of the blood vessels. We will return to the structure and function of the ANS in Chapter 15. For now, remember that when one speaks of an emotional reaction that is beyond voluntary control—like “butterﬂ ies in the stomach” or  blushing— it usually is mediated by the visceral PNS (the ANS). Afferent and Efferent Axons. Our discussion of the PNS is a good place to introduce two terms that are used to describe axons in the nervous sys- tem. Derived from the Latin, afferent (“carry to”) and efferent (“carry from”) indicate whether the axons are transporting information toward or away from a particular point. Consider the axons in the PNS relative to a point of reference in the CNS. The somatic or visceral sensory axons bringing information into the CNS are afferents. The axons that emerge from the CNS to innervate the muscles and glands are efferents. The Cranial Nerves In addition to the nerves that arise from the spinal cord and innervate the body, there are 12 pairs of cranial nerves that arise from the brain stem and innervate (mostly) the head. Each cranial nerve has a name and a number associated with it (originally numbered by Galen, about 1800 years ago, from anterior to posterior). Some of the cranial nerves are part of the CNS, others are part of the somatic PNS, and still others are part of the visceral PNS. Many cranial nerves contain a complex mixture of axons that perform different functions. The cranial nerves and their various functions are summarized in the chapter appendix. The Meninges The CNS, that part of the nervous system encased in the skull and verte- bral column, does not come in direct contact with the overlying bone. It is protected by three membranes collectively called the meninges (singular: meninx), from the Greek for “covering.” The three membranes are the dura mater, the arachnoid membrane, and the pia mater (Figure 7.6). The outermost covering is the dura mater , from the Latin words mean- ing “hard mother,” an accurate description of the dura’s leatherlike con- sistency. The dura forms a tough, inelastic bag that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Just under the dura lies the arachnoid membrane (from the Greek for “spider”). This meningeal layer has an appearance and a consistency resembling a spider web. While there normally is no space between the dura and the arachnoid, if the blood vessels passing through the dura are ruptured, blood can collect here and form what is called a subdural hematoma . The buildup of ﬂ uid in this subdural space can disrupt brain function by compressing parts of the CNS. The disorder is treated by drilling a hole in the skull and draining the blood. \n186 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS The pia mater , the “gentle mother,” is a thin membrane that adheres closely to the surface of the brain. Along the pia run many blood vessels that ultimately dive into the substance of the underlying brain. The pia is separated from the arachnoid by a ﬂ uid-ﬁ lled space. This subarachnoid space is ﬁ lled with salty clear liquid called cerebrospinal ﬂ uid (CSF) . Thus, in a sense, the brain ﬂ oats inside the head in this thin layer of CSF. The Ventricular System In Chapter 1, we noted that the brain is hollow. The ﬂ uid-ﬁ lled caverns and canals inside the brain constitute the ventricular system . The ﬂ uid that runs in this system is CSF, the same as the ﬂ uid in the subarachnoid space. CSF is produced by a special tissue, called the choroid plexus , in the ventricles of the cerebral hemispheres. CSF ﬂ ows from the paired ventricles of the cerebrum to a series of connected, central cavities at the core of the brain stem (Figure 7.7). CSF exits the ventricular system and enters the subarachnoid space by way of small openings, or aper- tures, located near where the cerebellum attaches to the brain stem. In the subarachnoid space, CSF is absorbed by the blood vessels at special structures called arachnoid villi . If the normal ﬂ ow of CSF is disrupted, brain damage can result (Box 7.1). We will return to ﬁ ll in some details about the ventricular system in a moment. As we will see, understanding the organization of the ventricu- lar system holds the key to understanding how the mammalian brain is organized. New Views of the Brain For centuries, anatomists have investigated the internal structure of the brain by removing it from the skull, sectioning it in various planes, staining the sections, and examining the stained sections. Much has been learned by this approach, but there are some limitations. Among these are the challenges of seeing how parts deep in the brain ﬁ t together in Dura mater (a) (b) Subdural space Arachnoid membrane Subarachnoid space Pia mater Artery Brain ▲ FIGURE 7.6 The meninges.

Subarachnoid space Ventricles in brain Choroid plexus Rostral Caudal ▲ FIGURE 7.7 The ventricular system in a rat brain. CSF is produced in the ventricles of the paired cerebral hemispheres and flows through a series of central ventricles at the core of the brain stem. CSF escapes into the subarachnoid space via small apertures near the base of the cerebel- lum. In the subarachnoid space, CSF is absorbed into the blood. \n187 CHAPTER 7 THE STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM three dimensions. A breakthrough occurred in 2013 when researchers at Stanford University introduced a new method, called CLARITY, which allows visualization of deep structures without sectioning the brain. The trick is to soak the brain in a solution that replaces light-absorbing lip- ids with a water-soluble gel that turns the brain transparent. If such a “ clariﬁ ed” brain contains neurons that are labeled with ﬂ uorescent molecules, such as green ﬂ uorescent protein ( GFP; see Chapter 2), then appropriate illumination will reveal the location of these cells deep inside the brain (Figure 7.8). O F  S P E C I A L  I N T E R E S T BOX 7.1 Water on the Brain I f the ﬂ ow of CSF from the choroid plexus through the ven- tricular system to the subarachnoid space is impaired, the ﬂ uid will back up and cause a swelling of the ventricles. This condition is called hydrocephalus , a term originally meaning “water head.” Occasionally, babies are born with hydrocephalus. However, because the skull is soft and not completely formed, the head will expand in response to the increased intracranial ﬂ uid, sparing the brain from damage. Often this condition goes unnoticed until the size of the head reaches enormous proportions. In adults, hydrocephalus is a much more serious situ- ation because the skull cannot expand, and intracranial pressure increases as a result. The soft brain tissue is then compressed, impairing function and leading to death if left untreated. Typically, this “obstructive” hydrocephalus is also accompanied by severe headache, caused by the distention of nerve endings in the meninges. Treatment consists of in- serting a tube into the swollen ventricle and draining off the excess ﬂ uid (Figure A). Tube inserted into lateral ventricle through hole in skull Drainage tube, usually introduced into peritoneal cavity, with extra length to allow for growth of child Figure A (a) (b) (c) FIGURE 7.8 A method to turn the brain transpar- ent and visualize fluorescent neurons deep in the brain.

Adapted from Chung and Deisseroth. 2013, Figure 2.) \n188 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS Of course, a clariﬁ ed brain is still a dead brain. This, to say the least, limits the usefulness of such anatomical methods for diagnosing neu- rological disorders in living individuals. Thus, it is no exaggeration to say that neuroanatomy was revolutionized by the introduction of several methods that enable one to produce images of the living brain. Here we brieﬂ y introduce them. Imaging the Structure of the Living Brain. Some types of electromagnetic radiation, like X-rays, penetrate the body and are absorbed by various radiopaque tissues. Thus, using X-ray-sensitive ﬁ lm, one can make two- dimensional images of the shadows formed by the radiopaque structures within the body. This technique works well for the bones of the skull, but not for the brain. The brain is a complex three-dimensional volume of slight and varying radiopacity, so little information can be gleaned from a single two-dimensional X-ray image. An ingenious solution, called computed tomography (CT), was de- veloped by Godfrey Hounsﬁ elds and Allan Cormack, who shared the Nobel Prize in 1979. The goal of CT is to generate an image of a slice of brain. (The word tomography is derived from the Greek for “cut.”) To accomplish this, an X-ray source is rotated around the head within the plane of the desired cross section. On the other side of the head, in the trajectory of the X-ray beam, are sensitive electronic sensors of X-irradiation. The information about relative radiopacity obtained with different viewing angles is fed to a computer that executes a mathematical algorithm on the data. The end result is a digital recon- struction of the position and amount of radiopaque material within the plane of the slice. CT scans noninvasively revealed, for the ﬁ rst time, the gross organization of gray and white matter, and the position of the ventricles, in the living brain. While still used widely, CT is gradually being replaced by a newer imaging method, called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) . The advan- tages of MRI are that it yields a much more detailed map of the brain than CT, it does not require X-irradiation, and images of brain slices can be made in any plane desired. MRI uses information about how hydrogen atoms in the brain respond to perturbations of a strong mag- netic ﬁ eld (Box 7.2). The electromagnetic signals emitted by the atoms are detected by an array of sensors around the head and fed to a power- ful computer that constructs a map of the brain. The information from an MRI scan can be used to build a strikingly detailed image of the whole brain. Another application of MRI, called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), enables visualization of large bundles of axons in the brain. By compar- ing the position of the hydrogen atoms in water molecules at discrete time intervals, the diffusion of water in the brain can be measured. Water dif- fuses much more readily alongside axon membranes than across them, and this difference can be used to detect axon bundles that connect differ- ent regions of the brain (Figure 7.9). Functional Brain Imaging. CT and MRI are extremely valuable for detect- ing structural changes in the living brain, such as brain swelling after a head injury and brain tumors. Nonetheless, much of what goes on in the brain—healthy or diseased—is chemical and electrical in nature and not observable by simple inspection of the brain’s anatomy. Amazingly, however, even these secrets are beginning to yield to the newest imaging techniques. ▲ FIGURE 7.9 Diffusion tensor imaging of the human brain.

It has become an important tool in neuroscience because it can be used noninvasively to obtain a detailed picture of the nervous system, particularly the brain. In the most common form of MRI, the hydrogen atoms are quantiﬁ ed—for instance, those located in water or fat in the brain. An important fact of physics is that when a hydrogen atom is put in a magnetic ﬁ eld, its nucleus (which consists of a single proton) can exist in either of two states: a high-energy state or a low-energy state. Because hydrogen atoms are abundant in the brain, there are many protons in each state. The key to MRI is making the protons jump from one state to the other. Energy is added to the protons by passing an electromagnetic wave (i.e., a radio signal) through the head while it is positioned between the poles of a large magnet. When the radio signal is set at just the right frequency, the protons in the low-energy state will absorb energy from the signal and hop to the high-energy state. The frequency at which the protons absorb energy is called the resonant fre- quency (hence the name magnetic resonance). When the radio signal is turned off, some of the protons fall back down to the low-energy state, thereby emitting a radio signal of their own at a particular frequency. This signal can be picked up by a radio receiver. The stronger the signal, the more hydrogen atoms between the poles of the magnet. If we used the procedure discussed earlier, we would simply get a measurement of the total amount of hydrogen in the head. However, it is possible to measure hydrogen amounts at a ﬁ ne spatial scale by taking advantage of the fact that the frequency at which protons emit energy is pro- portional to the size of the magnetic ﬁ eld. In the MRI ma- chines used in hospitals, the magnetic ﬁ elds vary from one side of the magnet to the other. This gives a spatial code to the radio waves emitted by the protons: High-frequency signals come from hydrogen atoms near the strong side of the magnet, and low-frequency signals come from the weak side of the magnet. The last step in the MRI process is to orient the gradient of the magnet at many different angles relative to the head and measure the amount of hydrogen. It takes about 15 minutes to make all the measurements for a typical brain scan. A so- phisticated computer program is then used to make a single image from the measurements, resulting in a picture of the distribution of hydrogen atoms in the head. Figure A is an MRI image of a lateral view of the brain in a living human. In Figure B, another MRI image, a slice has been made in the brain. Notice how clearly you can see the white and gray matter. This differentiation makes it possible to see the effects of demyelinating diseases on white mat- ter in the brain. MRI images also reveal lesions in the brain because tumors and inﬂ ammation generally increase the amount of extracellular water.

However, with the introduction of positron emis- sion tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) , it is now possible to observe and measure changes in brain activity associated with the planning and execution of speciﬁ c tasks. PET imaging was developed in the 1970s by two groups of physicists, one at Washington University led by M. M. Ter- Pogossian and M. E. Phelps, and a second at UCLA led by Z. H. Cho. The basic procedure is very simple. A radioac- tive solution containing atoms that emit positrons (posi- tively charged electrons) is introduced into the bloodstream. Positrons, emitted wherever the blood goes, interact with electrons to produce photons of electromagnetic radiation. The locations of the positron-emitting atoms are found by de- tectors that pick up the photons. One powerful application of PET is the measurement of metabolic activity in the brain. In a technique developed by Louis Sokoloff and his colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health, a positron-emitting isotope of ﬂ uorine or oxygen is attached to 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG). This radioac- tive 2-DG is injected into the bloodstream and travels to the brain. Metabolically active neurons, which normally use glu- cose, also take up the 2-DG. The 2-DG is phosphorylated by enzymes inside the neuron, and this modiﬁ cation prevents the 2-DG from leaving. Thus, the amount of radioactive 2-DG accumulated in a neuron and the number of positron emis- sions indicate the level of neuronal metabolic activity. In a typical PET application, a person’s head is placed in an apparatus surrounded by detectors (Figure A). Using computer algorithms, the photons (resulting from positron emissions) reaching each of the detectors are recorded. With this information, levels of activity for populations of neurons at B R A I N  F O O D various sites in the brain can be calculated. Compiling these measurements produces an image of the brain activity pat- tern. The researcher monitors brain activity while the subject performs a task, such as moving a ﬁ nger or reading aloud. Different tasks “light up” different brain areas. In order to ob- tain a picture of the activity induced by a particular behavioral or thought task, a subtraction technique is used. Even in the absence of any sensory stimulation, the PET image will con- tain a great deal of brain activity. To create an image of the brain activity resulting from a speciﬁ c task, such as a person looking at a picture, this background activity is subtracted out (Figure B). Although PET imaging has proven to be a valuable tech- nique, it has signiﬁ cant limitations. Because the spatial resolu- tion is only 5–10 mm 3 , the images show the activity of many thousands of cells. Also, a single PET brain scan may take one to several minutes to obtain. This, along with concerns about radiation exposure, limits the number of scans that can be ob- tained from one person in a reasonable time period. Thus, the work of S. Ogawa at Bell Labs, showing that MRI techniques could be used to measure local changes in blood oxygen lev- els that result from brain activity, was an important advance. The fMRI method takes advantage of the fact that oxyhe- moglobin (the oxygenated from of hemoglobin in the blood) has a magnetic resonance different from that of deoxyhemo- globin (hemoglobin that has donated its oxygen). More ac- tive regions of the brain receive more blood, and this blood donates more of its oxygen. Functional MRI detects the loca- tions of increased neural activity by measuring the ratio of oxyhemoglobin to deoxyhemoglobin. It has emerged as the method of choice for functional brain imaging because the scans can be made rapidly (50 msec), they have good spatial resolution (3 mm 3 ), and they are completely noninvasive. The two “functional imaging” techniques now in widespread use are positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) . While the technical details differ, both methods detect changes in regional blood ﬂ ow and metabolism within the brain (Box 7.3). The basic principle is simple. Neurons that are active demand more glu- cose and oxygen. The brain vasculature responds to neural activity by directing more blood to the active regions. Thus, by detecting changes in blood ﬂ ow, PET and fMRI reveal the regions of brain that are most active under different circumstances. The advent of imaging techniques has offered neuroscientists the ex- traordinary opportunity of peering into the living, thinking brain. As you can imagine, however, even the most sophisticated brain images are use- less unless you know what you are looking at. Next, let’s take a closer look at how the brain is organized. \n191 CHAPTER 7 THE STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Stimulation – = Control Difference Figure B A PET image.

The inside of the tube becomes the adult ventricular system. Thus, by examining how this tube changes during the course of fetal development, we can understand how the brain is organized and how the different parts ﬁ t together. This section focuses on development as a way to understand the structural organization of the brain. Chapter 23 will revisit the topic of development to describe how neurons are born, how they ﬁ nd their way to their ﬁ nal locations in the CNS, and how they make the appropriate synaptic con- nections with one another. As you work your way through this section, and through the rest of the book, you will encounter many different names used by anatomists to refer to groups of related neurons and axons. Some common names for describing collections of neurons and axons are given in Tables 7.1 and 7.2. Take a few moments to familiarize yourself with these new terms before continuing.

Cortex is Latin for “bark.” Example: cerebral cortex , the sheet of neurons found just under the surface of the cerebrum. Nucleus A clearly distinguishable mass of neurons, usually deep in the brain (not to be confused with the nucleus of a cell). Nucleus is from the Latin word for “nut.” Example: lateral geniculate nucleus , a cell group in the brain stem that relays information from the eye to the cerebral cortex. Substantia A group of related neurons deep within the brain but usually with less distinct borders than those of nuclei. Example: substantia nigra (from the Latin for “black substance”), a brain stem cell group involved in the control of voluntary movement. Locus (plural: loci) A small, well-deﬁ ned group of cells. Example: locus coeruleus (Latin for “blue spot”), a brain stem cell group involved in the control of wakefulness and behavioral arousal. Ganglion (plural: ganglia) A collection of neurons in the PNS. Ganglion is from the Greek for “knot.” Example: the dorsal root ganglia , which contain the cell bodies of sensory axons entering the spinal cord via the dorsal roots. Only one cell group in the CNS goes by this name: the basal ganglia , which are structures lying deep within the cerebrum that control movement.

These schematic illustrations follow the early development of the nervous system in the embryo. The drawings above are dorsal views of the embryo; those below are cross sections. (a) The primitive embryonic CNS begins as a thin sheet of ectoderm. (b) The first important step in the develop- ment of the nervous system is the formation of the neural groove. (c) The walls of the groove, called neural folds , come together and fuse, forming the neural tube. (d) The bits of neural ectoderm that are pinched off when the tube rolls up is called the neural crest , from which the PNS will develop. The somites are mesoderm that will give rise to much of the skeletal system and the muscles. Anatomy by itself can be pretty dry. It really comes alive only after the functions of different structures are understood. The remainder of this book is devoted to explaining the functional organization of the nervous system. However, we include in this section a preview of some structure- function relationships to provide you with a general sense of how the different parts contribute, individually and collectively, to the function of the CNS. Formation of the Neural Tube The embryo begins as a ﬂ at disk with three distinct layers of cells called endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. The endoderm ultimately gives rise to the lining of many of the internal organs (viscera). From the mesoderm arise the bones of the skeleton and the muscles. The nervous system and the skin derive entirely from the ectoderm . Our focus is on changes in the part of the ectoderm that give rise to the nervous system: the neural plate . At this early stage (about 17 days from conception in humans), the brain consists only of a ﬂ at sheet of cells (Figure 7.10a). The next event of interest is the formation of a \n194 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS groove in the neural plate that runs rostral to caudal, called the neural groove (Figure 7.10b). The walls of the groove are called neural folds , which subsequently move together and fuse dorsally, forming the neu- ral tube (Figure 7.10c). The entire central nervous system develops from the walls of the neural tube . As the neural folds come together, some neural ectoderm is pinched off and comes to lie just lateral to the neural tube. This tissue is called the neural crest (Figure 7.10d). All neurons with cell bodies in the peripheral nervous system derive from the neural crest. The neural crest develops in close association with the underlying me- soderm. The mesoderm at this stage in development forms  prominent bulges on either side of the neural tube called somites . From these somites, the 33 individual vertebrae of the spinal column and the related skeletal muscles will develop. The nerves that innervate these skeletal muscles are therefore called somatic motor nerves. The process by which the neural plate becomes the neural tube is called neurulation . Neurulation occurs very early in embryonic O F  S P E C I A L  I N T E R E S T BOX 7.4 Nutrition and the Neural Tube N eural tube formation is a crucial event in the development of the nervous system. It occurs early—only 3 weeks after conception—when the mother may be unaware she is preg- nant. Failure of the neural tube to close correctly is a com- mon birth defect, occurring in approximately 1 out of every 500 live births. A recent discovery of enormous public health importance is that many neural tube defects can be traced to a deﬁ ciency of the vitamin folic acid (or folate ) in the ma- ternal diet during the weeks immediately after conception. It has been estimated that dietary supplementation of folic acid during this period could reduce the incidence of neural tube defects by 90%. Formation of the neural tube is a complex process (Figure A). It depends on a precise sequence of changes in the three-dimensional shape of individual cells as well as on changes in the adhesion of each cell to its neighbors. The timing of neurulation must also be coordinated with simulta- neous changes in non-neural ectoderm and the mesoderm. At the molecular level, successful neurulation depends on speciﬁ c sequences of gene expression that are controlled, in part, by the position and local chemical environment of the cell. It is not surprising that this process is highly sensi- tive to chemicals, or chemical deﬁ ciencies, in the maternal circulation. The fusion of the neural folds to form the neural tube occurs ﬁ rst in the middle, then anteriorly and posteriorly (Figure B). Failure of the anterior neural tube to close results 0.180 mm Figure A Scanning electron micrographs of neurulation. (Source: Smith and Schoenwolf, 1997.) \n195 CHAPTER 7 THE STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM development, about 22 days after conception in humans. A common birth defect is the failure of appropriate closure of the neural tube. Fortunately, recent research suggests that most cases of neural tube defects can be avoided by ensuring proper maternal nutrition during this period (Box 7.4). Three Primary Brain Vesicles The process by which structures become more complex and function- ally specialized during development is called differentiation . The ﬁ rst step in the differentiation of the brain is the development, at the ros- tral end of the neural tube, of three swellings called the primary vesicles (Figure 7.11). The entire brain derives from the three primary vesicles of the neural tube . The rostral-most vesicle is called the prosencephalon . Pro is Greek for “before”; encephalon is derived from the Greek for “brain.” Thus, the pros- encephalon is also called the forebrain . Behind the prosencephalon lies in anencephaly , a condition characterized by degeneration of the forebrain and skull that is always fatal. Failure of the posterior neural tube to close results in a condition called spina biﬁ da . In its most severe form, spina biﬁ da is charac- terized by the failure of the posterior spinal cord to form from the neural plate ( biﬁ da is from the Latin word meaning “cleft in two parts”). Less severe forms are characterized by defects in the meninges and vertebrae overlying the posterior spinal cord. Spina biﬁ da, while usually not fatal, does require exten- sive and costly medical care. Folic acid plays an essential role in a number of meta- bolic pathways, including the biosynthesis of DNA, which naturally must occur during development as cells divide. Although we do not precisely understand why folic acid de- ﬁ ciency increases the incidence of neural tube defects, one can easily imagine how it could alter the complex choreog- raphy of neurulation. Its name is derived from the Latin word for “leaf,” reﬂ ecting the fact that folic acid was ﬁ rst isolated from spinach leaves. Besides green leafy vegetables, good dietary sources of folic acid are liver, yeast, eggs, beans, and oranges. Many breakfast cereals are now fortiﬁ ed with folic acid. Nonetheless, the folic acid intake of the average American is only half of what is recommended to prevent birth defects (0.4 mg/day). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that women take mul- tivitamins containing 0.4 mg of folic acid before planning pregnancy. 22 days Rostral Caudal (a) 23 days Normal Anencephaly Spina bifida (b) Figure B (a) Neural tube closure.

This view is from above, and the vesicles have been cut horizontally so that we can see the inside of the neural tube. \n196 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS another vesicle called the mesencephalon , or midbrain . Caudal to this is the third primary vesicle, the rhombencephalon , or hindbrain . The rhombencephalon connects with the caudal neural tube, which gives rise to the spinal cord. Differentiation of the Forebrain The next important developments occur in the forebrain, where second- ary vesicles sprout off on both sides of the prosencephalon. The secondary vesicles are the optic vesicles and the telencephalic vesicles . The central structure that remains after the secondary vesicles have sprouted off is called the diencephalon , or “between brain” (Figure 7.12). Thus, the forebrain at this stage consists of the two optic vesicles, the two telence- phalic vesicles, and the diencephalon. The optic vesicles grow and invaginate (fold in) to form the optic stalks and the optic cups, which will ultimately become the optic nerves and the two retinas in the adult (Figure 7.13). The important point is that the retina at the back of the eye, and the optic nerve containing the axons that connect the eye to the diencephalon and midbrain, are part of the brain, not the PNS. Differentiation of the Telencephalon and Diencephalon. The telence- phalic vesicles together form the telencephalon , or “endbrain,” consist- ing of the two cerebral hemispheres. The telencephalon continues to de- velop in four ways. (1) The telencephalic vesicles grow posteriorly so that they lie over and lateral to the diencephalon (Figure 7.14a). (2) Another pair of vesicles sprout off the ventral surfaces of the cerebral hemispheres, giving rise to the olfactory bulbs and related structures that partici- pate in the sense of smell (Figure 7.14b). (3) The cells of the walls of the telencephalon divide and differentiate into various structures. (4) White matter systems develop, carrying axons to and from the neurons of the telencephalon.

(d) White mat- ter structures of the forebrain. Figure 7.15 shows a coronal section through the primitive mammalian forebrain, to illustrate how the different parts of the telencephalon and diencephalon differentiate and ﬁ t together. Notice that the two cerebral hemispheres lie above and on either side of the diencephalon, and that the ventral–medial surfaces of the hemispheres have fused with the lat- eral surfaces of the diencephalon (Figure 7.15a). The ﬂ uid-ﬁ lled spaces within the cerebral hemispheres are called the lateral ventricles , and the space at the center of the diencephalon is called the third ventricle (Figure 7.15b). The paired lateral ventricles are a key landmark in the adult brain: Whenever you see paired ﬂ uid- ﬁ lled ventricles in a brain section, you know that the tissue surrounding them is in the telencephalon. The elongated, slit-like appearance of the third ventricle in cross section is also a useful feature for identifying the diencephalon. Notice in Figure 7.15 that the walls of the telencephalic vesicles ap- pear swollen due to the proliferation of neurons. These neurons form two different types of gray matter in the telencephalon: the cerebral cortex and the basal telencephalon . Likewise, the diencephalon dif- ferentiates into two structures: the thalamus and the hypothalamus (Figure 7.15c). The thalamus, nestled deep inside the forebrain, gets its name from the Greek word for “inner chamber.” The neurons of the developing forebrain extend axons to communicate with other parts of the nervous system. These axons bundle together to form three major white matter systems: the cortical white matter, the corpus callosum, and the internal capsule (Figure 7.15d). The cortical white matter contains all the axons that run to and from the neurons in the cerebral cortex. The corpus callosum is continuous with the cortical white matter and forms an axonal bridge that links cortical neurons of the two cerebral hemispheres. The cortical white matter is also continu- \n198 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS ous with the internal capsule , which links the cortex with the brain stem, particularly the thalamus. Forebrain Structure-Function Relationships. The forebrain is the seat of perceptions, conscious awareness, cognition, and voluntary action. All this depends on extensive interconnections with the sensory and motor neurons of the brain stem and spinal cord. Arguably the most important structure in the forebrain is the cerebral cortex. As we will see later in this chapter, the cortex is the brain struc- ture that has expanded the most over the course of human evolution. Cortical neurons receive sensory information, form perceptions of the out- side world, and command voluntary movements. Neurons in the olfactory bulbs receive information from cells that sense chemicals in the nose (odors), and relay this information caudally to a part of the cerebral cortex for further analysis. Information from the eyes, ears, and skin is also brought to the cerebral cortex for analysis. However, each of the sensory pathways serving vision, audition (hear- ing), and somatic sensation relays (i.e., synapses upon neurons) in the thalamus en route to the cortex. Thus, the thalamus is often referred to as the gateway to the cerebral cortex (Figure 7.16). Thalamic neurons send axons to the cortex via the internal capsule. As a general rule, the axons of each internal capsule carry information to the cortex about the contralateral side of the body. Therefore, if a thumbtack entered the right foot, it would be relayed to the left cortex by the left thalamus via axons in the left internal capsule. But how does the right foot know what the left foot is doing? One important way is by communication between the hemispheres via the axons in the corpus callosum. Cortical neurons also send axons through the internal capsule, back to the brain stem. Some cortical axons course all the way to the spinal cord, forming the corticospinal tract. This is one important way cortex can command voluntary movement. Another way is by communicating with neurons in the basal ganglia, a collection of cells in the basal tel- encephalon. The term basal is used to describe structures deep in the brain, and the basal ganglia lie deep within the cerebrum. The func- tions of the basal ganglia are poorly understood, but it is known that damage to these structures disrupts the ability to initiate voluntary movement. Other structures, contributing to other brain functions, are also present in the basal telencephalon. For example, in Chapter 18, we’ll discuss a structure called the amygdala that is involved in fear and emotion. Although the hypothalamus lies just under the thalamus, function- ally it is more closely related to certain telencephalic structures like the amygdala. The hypothalamus performs many primitive functions and therefore has not changed much over the course of mammalian evolu- tion. “Primitive” does not mean unimportant or uninteresting, however. The hypothalamus controls the visceral (autonomic) nervous system, which regulates bodily functions in response to the needs of the organ- ism. For example, when you are faced with a threatening situation, the hypothalamus orchestrates the body’s visceral ﬁ ght-or-ﬂ ight response. Hypothalamic commands to the ANS will lead to (among other things) an increase in the heart rate, increased blood ﬂ ow to the muscles for es- cape, and even the standing of your hair on end. Conversely, when you’re relaxing after Sunday brunch, the hypothalamus ensures that the brain is well nourished via commands to the ANS, which will increase peristalsis (movement of material through the gastrointestinal tract) and redirect ▲ FIGURE 7.16 The thalamus: gateway to the cerebral cortex.

Eye Ear Cerebral cortex Thalamus Skin \n199 CHAPTER 7 THE STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM blood to your digestive system. The hypothalamus also plays a key role in motivating animals to ﬁ nd food, drink, and sex in response to their needs. Aside from its connections to the ANS, the hypothalamus also directs bodily responses via connections with the pituitary gland located below the diencephalon. This gland communicates with many parts of the body by releasing hormones into the bloodstream. Differentiation of the Midbrain Unlike the forebrain, the midbrain differentiates relatively little during subsequent brain development (Figure 7.17). The dorsal surface of the mes- encephalic vesicle becomes a structure called the tectum (Latin for “roof”). SELF-QUIZ Listed below are derivatives of the forebrain that we have discussed. Be sure you know what each of these terms means.

The midbrain differentiates into the tectum and the tegmentum. The CSF-filled space at the core of the midbrain is the cerebral aqueduct. (Drawings are not to scale.) \n200 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS The ﬂ oor of the midbrain becomes the tegmentum . The CSF-ﬁ lled space in between constricts into a narrow channel called the cerebral  aqueduct . The aqueduct connects rostrally with the third ventricle of the diencepha- lon. Because it is small and circular in cross section, the cerebral aqueduct is a good landmark for identifying the midbrain. Midbrain Structure-Function Relationships. For such a seemingly sim- ple structure, the functions of the midbrain are remarkably diverse. Besides serving as a conduit for information passing from the spinal cord to the forebrain and vice versa, the midbrain contains neurons that contribute to sensory systems, the control of movement, and several other functions. The midbrain contains axons descending from the cerebral cortex to the brain stem and the spinal cord. For example, the corticospinal tract courses through the midbrain en route to the spinal cord. Damage to this tract in the midbrain on one side produces a loss of voluntary control of movement on the opposite side of the body. The tectum differentiates into two structures: the superior colliculus and the inferior colliculus. The superior colliculus receives direct input from the eye, so it is also called the optic tectum . One function of the optic tectum is to control eye movements, which it does via synaptic connec- tions with the motor neurons that innervate the eye muscles. Some of the axons that supply the eye muscles originate in the midbrain, bundling together to form cranial nerves III and IV. The inferior colliculus also receives sensory information but from the ear instead of the eye. The inferior colliculus serves as an important relay station for auditory information en route to the thalamus. The tegmentum is one of the most colorful regions of the brain because it contains both the substantia nigra (the black substance) and the red nucleus. These two cell groups are involved in the control of voluntary movement. Other cell groups scattered in the midbrain have axons that project widely throughout much of the CNS and function to regulate con- sciousness, mood, pleasure, and pain. Differentiation of the Hindbrain The hindbrain differentiates into three important structures: the cere- bellum, the pons , and the medulla oblongata —also simply called the medulla . The cerebellum and pons develop from the rostral half of the hindbrain (called the metencephalon ); the medulla develops from the cau- dal half (called the myelencephalon ). The CSF-ﬁ lled tube becomes the fourth ventricle , which is continuous with the cerebral aqueduct of the midbrain. At the three-vesicle stage, the rostral hindbrain in cross section is a simple tube. In subsequent weeks, the tissue along the dorsal–lateral wall of the tube, called the rhombic lip , grows dorsally and medially until it fuses with its twin on the other side. The resulting ﬂ ap of brain tissue grows into the cerebellum. The ventral wall of the tube differentiates and swells to form the pons (Figure 7.18). Less dramatic changes occur during the differentiation of the caudal half of the hindbrain into the medulla. The ventral and lateral walls of this region swell, leaving the roof covered only with a thin layer of non- neuronal ependymal cells (Figure 7.19). Along the ventral surface of each side of the medulla runs a major white matter system. Cut in cross section, these bundles of axons appear somewhat triangular in shape, explaining why they are called the medullary pyramids . \n201 CHAPTER 7 THE STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Differentiation Fourth ventricle Medulla Medullary pyramids Forebrain Midbrain Hindbrain ▲ FIGURE 7.19 Differentiation of the caudal hindbrain.

Like the midbrain, the hindbrain is an important conduit for information passing from the fore- brain to the spinal cord, and vice versa. In addition, neurons of the hind- brain contribute to the processing of sensory information, the control of voluntary movement, and regulation of the autonomic nervous system. The cerebellum, the “little brain,” is an important movement control center. It receives massive axonal inputs from the spinal cord and the pons. The spinal cord inputs provide information about the body’s position in space. The inputs from the pons relay information from the cerebral cortex, specifying the goals of intended movements. The cerebellum com- pares these types of information and calculates the sequences of muscle contractions that are required to achieve the movement goals. Damage to the cerebellum results in uncoordinated and inaccurate movements. Of the descending axons passing through the midbrain, over 90%— about 20 million axons in the human—synapse on neurons in the pons. The pontine cells relay all this information to the cerebellum on the oppo- site site. Thus, the pons serves as a massive switchboard connecting the cerebral cortex to the cerebellum. (The word pons is from the Latin word for “bridge.”) The pons bulges out from the ventral surface of the brain stem to accommodate all this circuitry. The axons that do not terminate in the pons continue caudally and enter the medullary pyramids. Most of these axons originate in the ce- rebral cortex and are part of the corticospinal tract. Thus, “pyramidal tract” is often used as a synonym for corticospinal tract. Near where the medulla joins with the spinal cord, each pyramidal tract crosses from one side of the midline to the other. A crossing of axons from one side to the other is known as a decussation , and this one is called the pyramidal decussation . The crossing of axons in the medulla explains why the cortex of one side of the brain controls movements on the opposite side of the body (Figure 7.20). In addition to the white matter systems passing through, the medulla contains neurons that perform many different sensory and motor func- tions. For example, the axons of the auditory nerves, bringing auditory information from the ears, synapse on cells in the cochlear nuclei of the medulla. The cochlear nuclei project axons to a number of different struc- tures, including the tectum of the midbrain (the inferior colliculus, dis- cussed above). Damage to the cochlear nuclei leads to deafness. Other sensory functions of the medulla include touch and taste. The medulla contains neurons that relay somatic sensory information from Neuron in motor cortex Pyramidal decussation Medulla Spinal cord ▲ FIGURE 7.20 The pyramidal decussation.

Destruction of the cells leads to anes- thesia (loss of feeling). Other neurons relay gustatory (taste) information from the tongue to the thalamus. And among the motor neurons in the medulla are cells that control the tongue muscles via cranial nerve XII. (So think of the medulla next time you stick out your tongue!) Differentiation of the Spinal Cord As shown in Figure 7.21, the transformation of the caudal neural tube into the spinal cord is straightforward compared to the differentiation of the brain. With the expansion of the tissue in the walls, the cavity of the tube constricts to form the tiny CSF-ﬁ lled spinal canal . Cut in cross section, the gray matter of the spinal cord (where the neurons are) has the appearance of a butterﬂ y. The upper part of the butterﬂ y’s wing is the dorsal horn , and the lower part is the ventral horn . The gray matter between the dorsal and ventral horns is called the intermediate zone . Everything else is white matter, consisting of col- umns of axons that run up and down the spinal cord. Thus, the bundles of axons running along the dorsal surface of the cord are called the dorsal columns , the bundles of axons lateral to the spinal gray matter on each side are called the lateral columns , and the bundles on the ventral surface are called the ventral columns . Spinal Cord Structure-Function Relationships. As a general rule, dor- sal horn cells receive sensory inputs from the dorsal root ﬁ bers, ventral horn cells project axons into the ventral roots that innervate muscles, Differentiation White matter columns Spinal canal Dorsal horn Intermediate zone Ventral horn Spinal gray matter Forebrain Midbrain Hindbrain ▲ FIGURE 7.21 Differentiation of the spinal cord. The butterfly-shaped core of the spinal cord is gray matter, divisible into dorsal and ventral horns, and an intermediate zone. Surrounding the gray matter are white matter columns running rostrocaudally, up and down the cord. The narrow CSF-filled channel is the spinal canal. (Drawings are not to scale.) \n204 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS and intermediate zone cells are interneurons that shape motor outputs in response to sensory inputs and descending commands from the brain. The large dorsal column contains axons that carry somatic sensory (touch) information up the spinal cord toward the brain. It’s like a super- highway that speeds information from the ipsilateral side of the body up to nuclei in the medulla. The postsynaptic neurons in the medulla give rise to axons that decussate and ascend to the thalamus on the contralat- eral side. This crossing of axons in the medulla explains why touching the left side of the body is sensed by the right side of the brain. The lateral column contains the axons of the descending corticospinal tract, which also cross from one side to the other in the medulla. These axons innervate the neurons of the intermediate zone and ventral horn and communicate the signals that control voluntary movement. There are at least a half-dozen tracts that run in the columns of each side of the spinal cord. Most are one-way and bring information to or from the brain. Thus, the spinal cord is the major conduit of information from the skin, joints, and muscles to the brain, and vice versa. However, the spinal cord is also much more than that. The neurons of the spinal gray matter begin the analysis of sensory information, play a critical role in coordinating movements, and orchestrate simple reﬂ exes (such as jerking away your foot from a thumbtack). Putting the Pieces Together We have discussed the development of different parts of the CNS: the telen- cephalon, diencephalon, midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord. Now let’s put all the individual pieces together to make a whole central nervous system. Figure 7.22 is a highly schematic illustration that captures the basic organizational plan of the CNS of all mammals, including humans. The paired hemispheres of the telencephalon surround the lateral ventricles.

(b) Major structures within each division of the brain. Note that the telencephalon consists of two hemispheres, although only one is illustrated. (c) The ventricular system. \n205 CHAPTER 7 THE STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Dorsal to the lateral ventricles, at the surface of the brain, lies the cortex. Ventral and lateral to the lateral ventricles lies the basal telencephalon. The lateral ventricles are continuous with the third ventricle of the di- encephalon. Surrounding this ventricle are the thalamus and the hypo- thalamus. The third ventricle is continuous with the cerebral aqueduct. Dorsal to the aqueduct is the tectum. Ventral to the aqueduct is the mid- brain tegmentum. The aqueduct connects with the fourth ventricle that lies at the core of the hindbrain. Dorsal to the fourth ventricle sprouts the cerebellum. Ventral to the fourth ventricle lie the pons and the medulla. You should see by now that ﬁ nding your way around the brain is easy if you can identify which parts of the ventricular system are in the neigh- borhood (Table 7.3). Even in the complicated human brain, the ventricu- lar system holds the key to understanding brain structure. Special Features of the Human CNS So far, we’ve explored the basic plan of the CNS as it applies to all mam- mals. Figure 7.23 compares the brains of the rat and the human. You can see immediately that there are indeed many similarities but also some obvious differences. Let’s start by reviewing the similarities. The dorsal view of both brains reveals the paired hemispheres of the telencephalon (Figure 7.23a). A  midsagittal view of the two brains shows the telencephalon extending rostrally from the diencephalon (Figure 7.23b). The diencephalon sur- rounds the third ventricle, the midbrain surrounds the cerebral aqueduct, and the cerebellum, pons, and medulla surround the fourth ventricle. Notice how the pons swells below the cerebellum, and how structurally elaborate the cerebellum is. Now let’s consider some of the structural differences between the rat and human brains. Figure 7.23a reveals a striking one: the many convo- lutions on the surface of the human cerebrum. The grooves in the surface of the cerebrum are called sulci (singular: sulcus ), and the bumps are called gyri (singular: gyrus ). Remember, the thin sheet of neurons that lies just under the surface of the cerebrum is the cerebral cortex. Sulci and gyri result from the tremendous expansion of the surface area of the cerebral cortex during human fetal development. The adult human cor- tex, measuring about 1100 cm 2 , must fold and wrinkle to ﬁ t within the conﬁ nes of the skull. This increase in cortical surface area is one of the “distortions” of the human brain. Clinical and experimental evidence in- dicates that the cortex is the seat of uniquely human reasoning and cogni- tion. Without cerebral cortex, a person would be blind, deaf, dumb, and unable to initiate voluntary movement. We will take a closer look at the structure of the cerebral cortex in a moment.

The side views of the rat and human brains in Figure 7.23c reveal further differences in the forebrain. One is the small size of the olfactory bulb in the human relative to the rat. On the other hand, notice again the growth of the cerebral hemisphere in the human. See how the cere- bral hemisphere of the human brain arcs posteriorly, ventrolaterally, and then anteriorly to resemble a ram’s horn. The tip of the “horn” lies right \n207 CHAPTER 7 THE STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM under the temporal bone (temple) of the skull, so this portion of the brain is called the temporal lobe (Figure 7.24). Three other lobes (named after skull bones) also describe the parts of human cerebrum. The portion of the cerebrum lying just under the frontal bone of the forehead is called the frontal lobe . The deep central sulcus marks the posterior border of the frontal lobe, caudal to which lies the parietal lobe , under the pari- etal bone. Caudal to that, at the back of the cerebrum under the occipital bone, lies the occipital lobe . It is important to realize that, despite the disproportionate growth of the cerebrum, the human brain still follows the basic mammalian brain plan laid out during embryonic development. Again, the ventricles are key. Although the ventricular system is distorted, particularly by the growth of the temporal lobes, the relationships that relate the brain to the different ventricles still hold (Figure 7.25). Frontal lobe Parietal lobe Central sulcus Occipital lobe Temporal lobe ▲ FIGURE 7.24 The lobes of the human cerebrum. Lateral ventricles Third ventricle Fourth ventricle FIGURE 7.25 The human ventricular system. Although the ventricles are distorted by the growth of the brain, the basic relationships of the ventricles to the surrounding brain are the same as those illustrated in Figure 7.22c. \n208 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS A GUIDE TO THE CEREBRAL CORTEX Considering its prominence in the human brain, the cerebral cortex deserves further description. As we will see repeatedly in subsequent chapters, the systems in the brain that govern the processing of sensa- tions, perceptions, voluntary movement, learning, speech, and cognition all converge in this remarkable organ. Types of Cerebral Cortex Cerebral cortex in the brain of all vertebrate animals has several com- mon features, as shown in Figure 7.26. First, the cell bodies of cortical neurons are always arranged in layers, or sheets, that usually lie paral- lel to the surface of the brain. Second, the layer of neurons closest to the A G U I D E T O T HE C ER E B RA L CO R TEX Alligator Rat Pia mater Molecular layer Apical dendrite Pyramidal cell Layer I II III IV V VI ▲ FIGURE 7.26 General features of the cerebral cortex. On the left is the structure of cortex in an alligator; on the right, a rat. In both species, the cortex lies just under the pia mater of the cerebral hemisphere, contains a molecular layer, and has pyramidal cells arranged in layers. \n209 CHAPTER 7 THE STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM surface (the most superﬁ cial cell layer) is separated from the pia mater by a zone that lacks neurons; it is called the molecular layer, or simply layer I . Third, at least one cell layer contains pyramidal cells that emit large dendrites, called apical dendrites , that extend up to layer I, where they form multiple branches. Thus, we can say that the cerebral cortex has a characteristic cytoarchitecture that distinguishes it, for example, from the nuclei of the basal telencephalon or the thalamus. Figure 7.27 shows a Nissl-stained coronal section through the caudal telencephalon of a rat brain. You don’t need to be Cajal to see that dif- ferent types of cortex can also be discerned based on cytoarchitecture. Medial to the lateral ventricle is a piece of cortex that is folded onto itself in a peculiar shape. This structure is called the hippocampus , which, despite its bends, has only a single cell layer. (The term is from the Greek word for “seahorse.”) Connected to the hippocampus ventrally and later- ally is another type of cortex that has only two cell layers. It is called the olfactory cortex because it is continuous with the olfactory bulb, which sits further anterior. The olfactory cortex is separated by a sulcus, called the rhinal ﬁ ssure , from another more elaborate type of cortex that has many cell layers. This remaining cortex is called neocortex . Unlike the hippocampus and olfactory cortex, neocortex is found only in mammals . Rhinal fissure Rhinal fissure Olfactory bulb Olfactory cortex Brain stem Neocortex Hippocampus Lateral ventricle ▲ FIGURE 7.27 Three types of cortex in a mammal. In this section of a rat brain, the lateral ventricles lie between the neocortex and the hippocampus on each side. The ventricles are not obvious because they are very long and thin in this region. Below the telencephalon lies the brain stem. What region of brain stem is this, based on the appearance of the fluid-filled space at its core? \n210 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS Thus, when we said previously that the cerebral cortex has expanded over the course of human evolution, we really meant that the neocortex has expanded. Similarly, when we said that the thalamus is the gateway to the cortex, we meant that it is the gateway to the neocortex. Most neu- roscientists are such neocortical chauvinists (ourselves included) that the term cortex , if left unqualiﬁ ed, is usually intended to refer to the cerebral neocortex. In Chapter 8, we will discuss the olfactory cortex in the context of the sense of smell. Further discussion of the hippocampus is reserved until later in this book, when we explore its role in the limbic system (Chapter 18) and in memory and learning (Chapters 24 and 25). The neo- cortex will ﬁ gure prominently in our discussions of vision, audition, so- matic sensation, and the control of voluntary movement in Part II, so let’s examine its structure in more detail. Areas of Neocortex Just as cytoarchitecture can be used to distinguish the cerebral cor- tex from the basal telencephalon, and the neocortex from the olfactory cortex, it can be used to divide the neocortex up into different zones. This is precisely what the famous German neuroanatomist Korbinian Brodmann did at the beginning of the twentieth century. He constructed a cytoarchitectural map of the neocortex (Figure 7.28). In this map, each area of cortex having a common cytoarchitecture is given a number. Thus, we have “area 17” at the tip of the occipital lobe, “area 4” just ante- rior to the central sulcus in the frontal lobe, and so on. What Brodmann guessed, but could not show, was that cortical areas that look different perform different functions. We now have evidence that this is true. For instance, we can say that area 17 is visual cor- tex, because it receives signals from a nucleus of the thalamus that is connected to the retina at the back of the eye. Indeed, without area 17, a human is blind. Similarly, we can say that area 4 is motor cortex be- cause neurons in this area project axons directly to the motor neurons of the ventral horn that command muscles to contract. Notice that the different functions of these two areas are speciﬁ ed by their different connections. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 17 18 19 20 21 22 37 38 41 42 44 45 46 ▲ FIGURE 7.28 Brodmann’s cytoarchitectural map of the human cerebral cortex. \n211 CHAPTER 7 THE STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Neocortical Evolution and Structure-Function Relationships. A problem that has fascinated neuroscientists since the time of Brodmann is how the neocortex has changed over the course of mammalian evolution. The brain is a soft tissue, so there is not a fossil record of the cortex of our early mammalian ancestors. Nonetheless, considerable insight can be gained by comparing the cortex of different living species (see Figure 7.1). The surface area of the cortex varies tremendously among species; for example, a comparison of mouse, monkey, and human cortex reveals dif- ferences in size on the order of 1:100:1000. On the other hand, there is little difference in the thickness of the neocortex in different mammals, varying by no more than a factor of two. Thus, we can conclude that the amount of cortex has changed over the course of evolution, but not its basic structure. The famous Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal, intro- duced in Chapter 2, wrote in 1899 that “while there are very remarkable differences of organization of certain cortical areas, these points of dif- ference do not go so far as to make impossible the reduction of the corti- cal structure to a general plan.” A challenge that has preoccupied many scientists since then has been to ﬁ gure out exactly what this plan is. As we will discuss in later chapters, modern thinking is that the smallest functional unit of the neocortex is a cylinder of neurons 2 mm high—the distance from the white matter to the cortical surface—and 0.5 mm in diameter. This cylinder, usually described as a neocortical column, con- tains on the order of 10,000 neurons and 100 million synapses (approxi- mately 10,000 synapses per neuron). We wish to understand the detailed wiring diagram of how these neurons connect with one another: the con- nectome of the neocortex. This is a tall order because synapses can be identiﬁ ed with conﬁ dence only using electron microscopy, which requires very thin ( \u0002 50 nm) sections of tissue. To give an idea of the magnitude of the challenge, consider the project that South African Nobel laure- ate Sidney Brenner and his collaborators conducted in the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill, in North London, England. Brenner was convinced that un- derstanding the neural basis of behavior required a circuit diagram, and to tackle this, he chose a simple organism, the 1 mm long ﬂ atworm, Caenorhabditis elegans (usually abbreviated C. elegans )—a far cry from the neocortex, granted, but possibly a tractable problem to solve because the worm has only 302 neurons and about 7000 synapses. Despite this relative simplicity, the “mind of the worm,” as they called their project, took over a dozen years to complete. Since the publication of this work in 1986, many of the obstacles to reconstructing a synaptic wiring diagram have begun to yield to advances in technology, including automated sec- tioning of brain tissue for electron microscopy and computer-aided recon- struction of volumes of tissue from very thin sections (Box 7.5). Although we are not there yet, such advances have spawned optimism that Cajal’s dream might soon be realized and not just for the cortex but for the en- tire brain. Brodmann proposed that neocortex expanded by the insertion of new areas. Detailed comparisons of cortical structure and function in living species with diverse evolutionary histories suggest that the primordial neocortex of our common mammalian ancestor consisted mainly of three types of cortex. The ﬁ rst type consists of primary sensory areas , which are the ﬁ rst to receive signals from the ascending sensory pathways. For example, area 17 is designated as primary visual cortex, or V1, because it receives input from the eyes via a direct path: retina to thalamus to \n212 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS M y career path has been full of zigs and zags. When I was close to completing my Ph.D. in theoretical physics, my advisor sent me to Bell Laboratories in New Jersey for a summer job. As the famous research and development arm of the telecommunication company AT&T, Bell Labs had produced Nobel Prize–winning discoveries and seminal in- ventions like the transistor. During my summer there, I was supposed to theorize about superconductivity. Instead, I met Haim Sompolinsky, who had just arrived from Israel for a sab- batical year. Haim had previously developed mathematical models of interacting particles in a magnetic ﬁ eld and was now enthusiastically moving on to interacting neurons. I was hooked by this theory of neural networks, so I followed Haim to Jerusalem for post-doctoral training. We applied ideas from statistical physics to understand when artiﬁ cial neural networks—that is, networks of computational units modeled loosely after neurons—learn not gradually but suddenly, as if with an “aha!” moment. When not engaged in lengthy math- ematical calculations, I also learned to speak Hebrew and how to make hummus. After two years in Jerusalem, I returned to Bell Labs. In the organizational chart, all company departments had a ﬁ ve- digit number. I belonged to Theoretical Physics, Department 11111. That meant we were the smartest of the smart, right? But Bell Labs was under pressure to be useful—to produce not Nobel Prizes but more revenue for AT&T—and some quipped, “The more 1’s in your department number, the more useless you are.” Still, Bell Labs was like Disneyland for the mind, jam- packed with researchers working on a dizzying variety of inter- esting topics. Many left their ofﬁ ce doors open, so you could pop in and ask questions any time. Experimental physicists in the Biological Computation Department were pioneering the use of functional MRI and advanced microscopy to observe neural activity. At the other end of the building were computer scientists working in the ﬁ eld of machine learning—a process by which a computer can “learn” from experience rather than being explicitly programmed. Soon I was inventing algorithms that enabled artiﬁ cial neu- ral networks to learn, and I developed a mathematical theory of a hindbrain neural circuit called the oculomotor integra- tor . I continued this work after moving to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an assistant professor. In 2004, I was tenured and promoted to the rank of full professor. I should have been happy, but instead, I felt depressed. My theory of the oculomotor integrator was interesting and even plausible, judging from experimental tests by my collaborator David Tank at Princeton. But others were continuing to pro- pose alternative theories, and the ﬁ eld showed no sign of con- verging on a consensus. My theory assumed the existence of recurrent connections between integrator neurons. Yet after a decade of study, I didn’t even know for sure whether inte- grator neurons were connected to each other at all! When I complained to David, he suggested that I change my research focus. In the 1990s, we had both worked at Bell Labs with Winfried Denk, who had since moved to the Max Planck Institute of Biomedical Research in Heidelberg. There Winfried had built an ingenious automated device that could image the face of a block of brain tissue, and then shave off a thin slice to expose a new face. By repeatedly cutting deeper and deeper into the block, the device could acquire a three-dimensional (3D) image of brain tissue. Because Winfried’s device used an electron microscope, the image was sharp enough to reveal all synapses, as well as all neu- rons in the tissue. (Recall that Cajal could visualize only a small number of neurons with his light microscope and the P A T H  O F  D I S C O V E R Y BOX 7.5 Connecting with the Connectome cortex. The second type of neocortex consists of secondary sensory areas , so designated because of their heavy interconnections with the primary sensory areas. The third type of cortex consists of motor areas ,  which are intimately involved with the control of voluntary movement. These cortical areas receive inputs from thalamic nuclei that relay informa- tion from the basal telencephalon and the cerebellum, and they send outputs to motor control neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord. For example, because cortical area 4 sends outputs directly to motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, it is designated the primary motor cortex, or M1. It is believed that the common mammalian ancestor had \n213 CHAPTER 7 THE STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Golgi stain, and could not see synapses at all.) In principle, from such an image it would be possible to reconstruct the “wiring diagram” of a piece of brain tissue by tracing the paths of neural branches, the “wires” of the brain, and locat- ing the synapses. The catch was the huge amount of image data that had to be analyzed. Winfried’s device had the potential to generate a petabyte of data from a cubic millimeter volume, the equiva- lent of a billion pictures in your digital photo album. Manual reconstruction of the wiring diagram would be prohibitively time-consuming. I decided to work on the problem of speed- ing up image analysis by computer automation. In 2006, my laboratory began collaborating with Winfried’s laboratory to apply the methods of machine learning to his images. This computational method signiﬁ cantly improved the speed and accuracy of 3D reconstruction of neurons. However, the method still made errors, so it could not completely re- place human intelligence. In 2008, we started creating soft- ware that would enable humans to work with the machines to reconstruct neural circuits. This eventually turned into the “citizen science” project called EyeWire , which has regis- tered over 150,000 players from 100 countries since its 2012 launch (http://blog.eyewire.org/about). “EyeWirers” analyze images by playing a game resembling a 3D coloring book. By coloring, they reconstruct the branches of neurons, which are like the “wires” of the brain (Figure A). In 2014, Nature published the ﬁ rst EyeWire-assisted dis- covery: a new wiring diagram for a neural circuit in the retina. The discovery suggests a new solution to a problem that has eluded neuroscientists for 50 years: How does the retina detect moving visual stimuli? Researchers are conducting experiments to test our new theory, and only time will tell whether it’s correct. But it’s already clear that our computa- tional technologies for reconstructing connectivity are accel- erating progress towards understanding how neural circuits function. I'm now at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, where I am continuing to work towards my dream of recon- structing a connectome, a wiring diagram of an entire brain. on the order of about 20 different areas that could be assigned to these three categories. Figure 7.29 shows views of the brain of a rat, a cat, and a human, with the primary sensory and motor areas identiﬁ ed. It is plain to see that when we speak of the expansion of the cortex in mammalian evolu- tion, what has expanded is the region that lies in between these areas. Much of the “in-between” cortex reﬂ ects expansion of the number of sec- ondary sensory areas devoted to the analysis of sensory information. For example, in primates that depend heavily on vision, such as humans, the number of secondary visual areas has been estimated to be between 20 Figure A Seven neurons in a small volume of retina with their dendrites reconstructed from electron micro- scopic images. The neurites belonging to each neuron are colored differently. (Source: Courtesy of Dr. Sebastian Seung, Princeton University, and Kris Krug, Pop Tech.) \n214 PART ONE FOUNDATIONS and 40. However, even after we have assigned primary sensory, motor, and secondary sensory functions to large regions of cortex, a considerable amount of area remains in the human brain, particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes. These are the association areas of cortex. Association cortex is a more recent evolutionary development, a noteworthy charac- teristic of the primate brain. The emergence of the “mind”—our unique ability to interpret behavior (our own and that of others) in terms of unobservable mental states, such as desires, intentions, and beliefs— correlates best with the expansion of the frontal cortex. Indeed, as we will see in Chapter 18, lesions of the frontal cortex can profoundly alter an individual’s personality. CONCLUDING REMARKS Although we have covered a lot of new ground in this chapter, we have only scratched the surface of neuroanatomy. Clearly, the brain deserves its status as the most complex piece of matter in the universe. What we have presented here is a shell, or scaffold, of the nervous system and some of its contents. Understanding neuroanatomy is necessary for understanding how the brain works. This statement is just as true for an undergraduate ﬁ rst- time neuroscience student as it is for a neurologist or a neurosurgeon. In fact, neuroanatomy has taken on a new relevance with the advent of methods of imaging the living brain (Figure 7.30). An Illustrated Guide to Human Neuroanatomy appears as an appen- dix to this chapter. Use the guide as an atlas to locate various struc- tures of interest. Labeling exercises are also provided to help you learn the names of the parts of the nervous system you will encounter in this book. In Part II, Sensory and Motor Systems, the anatomy presented in this chapter and its appendix will come alive, as we explore how the brain goes about the tasks of smelling, seeing, hearing, sensing touch, and moving.
