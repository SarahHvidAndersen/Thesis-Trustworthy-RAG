    "text": "After 45 years of its development and use 1–3 , we reflect here on the position of MEG among the techniques available to explore and resolve brain function and dysfunction. This review focuses on the aspects that uniquely characterize MEG. We emphasize the specific strengths of the modality, such as its source imaging capabilities. We also identify and discuss practical challenges, in particular in signal extraction and interpretation. Because MEG and electroencephalography (EEG) appear to be sister electrophysiological techniques that are both sensitive to the electrochemical current flows within and between brain cells, MEG is sometimes thought to be equivalent to EEG, with limited scientific added value. We refute this misconception and explain how distinct physical principles make these two modalities complementary in many respects, rather than purely redundant. In particular, we argue that MEG is the modality with the best combination of direct and noninvasive access to the electrophysiological activity of the entire brain, with sub-millisecond temporal resolution and ability to resolve activity between cerebral regions with often surprising spatial and spectral differentiation and minimum bias. Indeed, unlike EEG, the accuracy of MEG source mapping is immune to the signal dis­ tortions caused by the complex layering of head tissues, with highly heterogeneous conductivity profiles that cannot be measured with precision in vivo . We explore these ideas herein in details and conclude that MEG, used independently or in combination with other brain imaging tech­ niques, contributes uniquely to our deeper comprehension of both the regional and large-scale neural dynamics of the brain: from the clarification of the nature of spontaneous and event-related brain activation to the elucidation of the mechanisms that yield functional connectivity between regions and the emergence of modes of network communication in brain systems. As the function and dynamical principles of the signal components present in the volumes of dense and intricate MEG data become better understood, we explain how MEG plays an increasing and pivotal role toward the elucidation of the grand mechanistic principles of cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience. To this end, we emphasize that MEG is particularly equipped to bridge human data with animal and computational mod­ els of electrophysiology in health and disease. We also review the principles of MEG signaling and the state of the art of the technology, with a perspective on innovations on the horizon. We then highlight key MEG contributions to neuroscience and discuss translations to clinical practice. Along the way, while we discuss limitations, current difficulties and uncertainties asso­ ciated with the technique, we also wish to correct some mistaken perceptions of MEG. Measurement principles and instrumentation The basic principles of MEG are simple; the sophistication lies in the sensing technology involved and the methodology required to extract relevant signal information in the widest variety of experi­ mental contexts. Fundamentally, any electrical current produces magnetic induction (often popularly confounded with a magnetic field 4 ), whose strength can be measured remote from the current source—for example, with a pick-up coil. The magnetic flux across the coil surface induces an electrical current in the coil wiring mate­ rial, whose amplitude is instantaneously proportional to that of the magnetic induction and is readily measurable. Basic signal origins. In MEG, the electrochemical currents circulat­ ing within and between neurons generate the magnetic induction. Postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) are considered the main generators of these ionic currents 3,5 . There is also convincing though limited evidence that fast ripples present in MEG signals in the range of 500–1,000 Hz could be related to cell discharges 6,7 . Yet they may also be explained by large spike components of PSP activity due to voltage- dependent channel conductance 8 ( Fig. 1 ).

While emphasizing its specific strengths in terms of millisecond source imaging, we also identify and discuss current practical challenges, in particular in signal extraction and interpretation. We also take issue with some perceived disadvantages of MEG, including the misconception that the technique is redundant with electroencephalography. Overall, MEG contributes uniquely to our deeper comprehension of both regional and large-scale brain dynamics: from the functions of neural oscillations and the nature of event-related brain activation, to the mechanisms of functional connectivity between regions and the emergence of modes of network communication in brain systems. We expect MEG to play an increasing and pivotal role in the elucidation of these grand mechanistic principles of cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience. © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

We discuss below the possible functions and interdepend­ ence across this wide spectral range of brain signals 10 . Instrumentation: innovations on the horizon. In practical terms, the magnetic signal produced by neural currents in the nanoampere (10 −9 A) range is formidably weak. Extracranial magnetic inductions are typically measured on a scale of femtoteslas (10 −15 T), about 10 to 100 million times smaller than the Earth’s static magnetic field. This reality imposes a need for sensitive sensor technology. The present industry standards rely on pick-up coils coupled with superconducting interference devices (SQUIDs) 2,3 . SQUIDs exploit the principles of quantum physics for the detection of small electrical currents, like those induced by weak mag­ netic signals, with high sensitivity and large dynamic ranges. State-of-the-art commercial systems feature coil magnetometers arranged in whole-head arrays of about 300 independent channels, sampled at up to 30 kHz simultaneously. Magnetic induction travels through the air: MEG sensors are not attached to the scalp, as the entire sensing apparatus is embedded in a thermally insulated tank, called a dewar, filled with 70–100 L of liquid helium. Superconducting temperatures minimize thermal noise and therefore optimize data quality. Consequently, subject preparation times are much shorter than in EEG, as the contactless and gel-free sensors do not need to be positioned and carefully verified manually. Another distinctive property of MEG is that magnetic induction is a vector signature of electrodynamics. In concrete terms, MEG sig­ nals depend on the location and orientation of the pick-up coils with respect to neural sources, which vary between system manufacturers and are relative to the subject’s head position in the helmet. This represents a clear practical difference from EEG, which meas­ ures differences of scalar electrical potentials between electrodes attached to the scalp. Although the head’s shape and size obviously vary between individuals, the standardization of electrode montages scaled to the individual anatomy and with a common nomenclature 11 has greatly contributed to streamlining the dissemination and com­ parison of EEG results between instruments, studies and individual subjects, including patients. In MEG, both the monitoring of head movements during data acquisition and the registration of head posi­ tions between participants are therefore important factors for data quality and comparison, respectively. Besides online video monitoring of subjects, all MEG systems feature real-time measurements of head position. Limited offline software solutions for head movement com­ pensation are available and can be necessary with special populations, such as infants 12 . Creative hardware solutions have been recently proposed, using adjustable head casts to consistently reposition the subject within and between sessions with millimeter accuracy 13 . Also unlike EEG data, MEG measures are reference-free: magnetic induction values are not relative to a common measure. The measure­ ment of absolute physical quantities is an asset of MEG. In principle, though, EEG datasets can always be re-referenced with respect to their instantaneous arithmetic mean as a form of standardization 14 . Furthermore, the dependence of MEG signal strength on head position mitigates the advantage of collecting reference-free quanti­ ties. We shall see below that source imaging obviates the limitations attached to sensor data analysis and affords one specific strength of MEG with respect to EEG. Overall, the MEG sensing technology is mature but its sophistica­ tion and maintenance impose substantial capital and operating costs. Fortunately, emerging opportunities for more cost-effective solutions bode well of the long-term sustainability and greater affordability of MEG as a research tool. Helium-based cryogenics are constantly threatened by a looming shortage in natural resources. Hence the development of alterna­ tive sensing and instrument technology is vital to MEG, as well as other high-end instruments such as MRI scanners. Practical onsite helium recycling solutions have emerged and approach 90% efficacy. They reduce weekly refills to one or two per year. Still, thermal insu­ lation negatively affects the sensitivity of the instrument: sensors are separated from the head surface by a distance of at least 2 cm. Recent integration of SQUID sensors in a partially adjustable helmet is a true breakthrough, improving signal strength and encouraging developmental neuroscience MEG research 15 . New sensing technology is maturing. Non-cryogenic HyQUID detectors with noise performance equivalent to that of traditional SQUIDs is already found in a commercially available system. Similarly, optically pumped magnetometers 16 (OPM) based on radi­ cally different sensing physics principles also represent an alternative to SQUID-based technology. Although less sensitive, OPMs can be positioned directly on the scalp surface and therefore pick up stronger field strengths as they are brought closer to the brain 17 . OPMs are very cost-effective, which also bodes well for easier access and therefore greater adoption of MEG by more neuroscientists. The extreme sensitivity of present and future MEG sensing tech­ nology is challenged by many electromagnetic nuisance sources. Any moving metal object (for example, car traffic, elevators, carts or hospital beds) or electrically powered instrument generates magnetic induction that is orders of magnitude stronger than the brain’s. Their influence can be reduced by combining magnetometers to emphasize brain signals with respect to environmental noise.

( a ) For simplicity, we take the cortical pyramidal neuron to epitomize the elementary cellular generator of MEG signals. All physiological currents from all cell types generate a magnetic induction; the elongated morphology of the pyramidal neuron constrains the net primary current circulation along the cell, which is a factor in creating greater signal strength in comparison to those from more stellate cellular morphologies. The primary current results from an imbalance in electrical potentials between the apical dendritic arborescence of the cell and its soma and more basal dendrites. The magnetic induction isolines in purple are perpendicular to the primary current flow and can be picked up outside the head. The sources are twofold: the postsynaptic potentials (PSPs), including fast, large-amplitude sodium spikes, and axonal discharges (action potentials, AP). The slower components of the PSPs are substantially smaller in amplitude than the APs. ( b ) At the scale of cell assemblies, the mass effect of slower PSPs is stronger than that of APs owing to their greater overlap in time without requiring rigorous synchronization. Computational models and empirical evidence show that a minimum of 10,000 to 50,000 cells are required to produce a signal detectable with MEG 8 . It is possible, in principle, that fast PSP spiking activity, and possibly shadows of APs, are detectable in MEG. © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

The best solution remains the installation of a heavy (20-ton), multilayered shielding room to host the MEG instrument. However, this represents about a quarter of the investment cost and can be difficult to site. Lighter and slightly more compact shielding solutions based on the active shielding technology are possible alternatives. Finally and remarkably, MEG sensing technology can be used to detect magnetic resonance phenomena at ultralow fields (in the 10–100 mT range). In addition to special magnetic resonance–related advantages, there are potential benefits in such all-in-one hybrid imaging technology: combined MRI and MEG can be obtained simultaneously, thereby limiting registration errors 18 . Yet the lower magnetization induces weaker signal strength and imposes longer magnetic resonance acquisition times. It remains unclear whether this technology will truly penetrate neuroscience applications. Distinct capabilities for electrophysiology and imaging MEG as a method of electrophysiology. In featuring channels arrays around the head and sensor signals originating from brain physi­ ological currents, MEG and EEG are sister techniques for noninva­ sive electrophysiology. This apparent similarity has fueled a certain amount controversy about the actual scientific and clinical added value of MEG. Some EEG scientists consider the technology to be simply redundant and not worth the extra cost 19,20 . This misconcep­ tion has been exacerbated by the fact that to obtain measurable mark­ ers of brain activity, early MEG studies and even many recent ones have resorted to the signal extraction techniques of EEG, averaging multiple trials of sensor signals time-locked to specific stimulus or behavioral events 11 . The fact that both the timing and spatial prop­ erties of the resulting event-related fields (ERFs) are only partially consistent with the extensively studied nomenclature of event-related potentials (ERPs) cannot be interpreted in favor of or against MEG or EEG. If we imagine that ERFs were entirely concordant with ERPs, shall we conclude that MEG is simply redundant with EEG? If ERF counterparts of ERPs are absent, does this mean ERPs are actually artifactual? This apparent discordance is also true for the power and spatial distribution of sensor signals in the typical frequency bands of electrophysiology (delta, theta, alpha, etc.; see below). To understand why MEG and EEG are actually different and com­ plementary techniques for observing the electrical activity of the brain, we need to go back to Maxwell electrodynamics 4,5 . These rules show that the spatial topography of magnetic induction and electrical potentials created by the same current source depend very differently on key factors. First and foremost, EEG signals are primarily and strongly affected by the substantial difference in electrical conduc­ tivity between the scalp, skull and other biological tissues. Magnetic permittivity, the magnetic equivalent of conductivity, is homogenous and identical across all compartments, including the air between the scalp and sensors. Consequently, the spatial topography of MEG sen­ sor data is visually and quantitatively less smeared and distorted than that of EEG electrical potentials produced by the same physiological brain sources. This contributes to a clearer interpretation of MEG sensor topography in terms of the putative anatomical locations of its underlying brain sources. It also helps separate the contributions of brain signals from ambiguous physiological contaminants, such as ocular microsaccades 21 and muscular artifacts 22,23 , which can be confounded with high-frequency brain signals in EEG but are more clearly distinguished on the basis of their distinctive sensor topogra­ phy with MEG. Artifact components can be eliminated or corrected when good-practice guidelines are respected 24 . The laws of physics however, impose a different set of challenges on MEG. MEG’s signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases faster with source depth—that is, the distance between neural generators and exter­ nal sensors. Hence there is a belief that MEG cannot see deep into the brain. This should rather be interpreted as decreased sensitivity Ideal case, with true head shape and tissues conductivity Realistic case, with approximation of tissues conductivity and head shape as sphere a b c pA m 0.08 0.02 Amplitude bias MEG EEG Actual source pA m MEG EEG Localization bias 64 EEG channels 275-channel MEG 256-channel EEG fT -Max Max µ V 0.04 0 0.01 0 0.04 0.08 0 Figure 2 An example comparing MEG and EEG. Synthetic data were generated by impressing a simulated uniform current density on a 1-cm 2 patch of cortical surface (green in b , c ). The cortical surface and the other tissue compartments (scalp, skull bone, cerebrospinal fluid) were that of the ICBM152 template, available in the Brainstorm open-source application 138 . The corresponding, ground-truth MEG data were simulated on the sensor configuration of a 275-channel CTF (axial gradiometers) system. The 256-channel EEG sensor configuration was that of Electrical Geodesics. The reference head model was derived using the OpenMEEG boundary element method 139 with default parameters, also available in Brainstorm.

As predicted from physics of magnetic induction, the MEG source map is immune to geometric and conductivity approximations, whereas the EEG is not. This latter has considerably lower amplitude than the actual current strength (note distinct color scales for MEG and EEG). © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

MEG is also less sensitive to neural current flows with a radial orien­ tation—that is, those aligned along a virtual radius of the head, from its center to the scalp envelope. Here too, the conception that MEG is entirely blind to radial sources would actually be valid only if the shape of the head were a perfect sphere 5 . For all these reasons, and if we assume that brain activity, including the sources of event-related components, involves regions present­ ing a variety of depths and current flow orientations, there can be at best limited correspondence between MEG and EEG sensor data. We also need to bear in mind that these modalities actually meas­ ure different, nonredundant physical quantities. Consequently, direct comparison studies between the femtoteslas of MEG and the microvolts of EEG sensor data can prove more challenging than ini­ tially thought. The appreciation of converging or complementary evidence between the techniques can be best conducted by assessing their respective abilities to resolve the physiological currents at their source, as discussed below. Yet we also need to acknowledge that many neuroscience questions may not require brain mapping: there is established and continued scientific interest in and clinical significance for MEG sensor data analyses, in their ability to discriminate between experimental condi­ tions, including with spatial-filtering 25 and decoding techniques 26 , and to correlate with or predict behavior 27 . They also suggest sim­ ple and practical new disease markers 28 . We re-emphasize, however, that the anatomical interpretation of scalp signals remains ambig­ uous, even in MEG. The cross-talk between sensors due to signal smearing represents a source of severe confounds, especially to func­ tional connectivity measures 29 applied to scalp data. Source imaging can alleviate these issues. MEG as an imaging modality. Relatively to EEG, the advanced sensing technology involved in MEG has attracted the continued interest and expertise of the physics and electrical engineering community. This influence manifests in approaching source localization and imaging as inverse modeling, a category of problems common to many subfields of applied physics and biomedical imaging 5 . Indeed, one truly distinctive advantage of MEG is arguably in producing time-resolved maps of neu­ ral currents that are considerably less prone to distortion by modeling approximations than EEG. There is strong evidence that EEG source models suffer from uncontrolled biases caused by inevitable approxi­ mations in defining the head shape 30 , especially the bone of the skull 31 . The presence of blood vessels also affects EEG source modeling 32 . More generally, the conductivity of head tissues remains in practice unmeas­ urable in vivo 33,34 , and the approximated values used also impose a localization and amplitude bias on estimated EEG sources 35,36 ( Fig. 2 ). Further approximations in modeling the electrode size and drifts in skin-contact impedances also contribute negatively 37 . Ground-truth direct-comparison studies of MEG and EEG source localization, using electrical sources implanted in realistic skull phan­ toms 38,39 , confirms the greater sensitivity of EEG to model approxi­ mations. Localization errors of up to 25 mm were produced by EEG source modeling, while the maximum MEG localization bias was limited to about 1 cm under the same experimental circumstances. Multimodal comparison studies taking fMRI as reference tend to show lesser differences 40 , especially when simultaneously recorded MEG and EEG data is processed jointly to yield, in principle, a supe­ rior, superadditive joint source model of cortical generators 41,42 . Therefore, whenever possible, a good-practice guideline is to record from at least a few EEG electrodes simultaneously with MEG. This augments the chances of obtaining converging evidence about the underlying brain processes. Box 1  Toward increased clinical adoption The actual value of clinical MEG for epilepsy is now well documented and argued, with large-volume retrospective studies reporting on the level of agreement between the noninvasive test and standard-of-care approaches (for example, invasive EEG) in severe cases 113,132,133 . Yet retrospective studies are also limited by design: if MEG is concordant with invasive tests, then it is deemed as good as the latter; if it is discordant and points at other possibly epileptogenic brain regions, results need to be carefully assessed depending on whether interventions based on the standard-of-care data actually led to long-term freedom from seizures. Ideally, multicenter prospective trials of MEG predictions would need to be conducted, with intracra­ nial explorations guided in part by MEG source imaging, followed by surgical resections, to fully assess the insight provided by MEG. Other practical limitations include the very duration of present MEG tests. These are typically limited to hour-long recordings to minimize cost and maximize patient comfort. This is often very short for capturing canonical epileptiform events such as interictal spikes and, even more rarely, seizures, which are still considered of the highest value for clinical diagnosis. Tests are also often performed as outpatient procedures, with patients on medication, which further reduces the yield in terms of epileptiform events. Considering a patient brain as constantly under siege by a neurological or neuropsychiatric disorder, clinical MEG research needs to point at other possible markers of aberrant ongoing or stimulus-response brain activity as alternative expressions of disease. A considerable body of work in autism spectrum disorder indicates that simple MEG measures of delayed early auditory responses, easily implementable in the clinic, are indicative of the syndrome’s severity 28,115 and are concordant with magnetic resonance tractography and with predisposing gene dosage 134 . Altered expression of background brain rhythms represents another source of electrophysiological MEG markers that remains relatively uncharted. This is an opportunity for MEG clinical research to verify the promises of animal research and diseases models in the great variety of insults and disorders that affect the human brain 135–137 . Such research can only benefit from the consolidation and growing availability of large databanks of control MEG volumes, to help identify how these new disease markers deviate from normative variants 84 ( Fig. 4 ). MEG is clinically prescribed and reimbursed in a few countries for specific indications, such as pharmacologically intractable epilepsy and presurgi­ cal functional mapping of brain tumors. We note in passing that clinical recognition, including reimbursement, for fMRI tests is still largely lacking as well. In principle, clinical demand will boost the number of installations and improve access for researchers, eventually closing the virtuous loop back to more clinical indications for MEG tests. This wishful scenario has not entirely happened yet: MEG clinical programs typically see anywhere between a dozen and a maximum of a couple of hundred epilepsy cases annually. This situation can pose challenges in terms of financial sustainability if not complemented by a critical mass of funded research studies or intramural institutional commitment. Brain tumor cases are rarely seen because MEG analysis pipelines remain time-consuming. This is a factor typically incompatible with the time pressures of clinical decision-making and surgical interventions in neuro-oncology. It is the present reality that, so far, MEG vendors have delivered beautifully crafted instruments without investing enough resources in developing truly efficient software analysis pipelines to serve the special needs of clinical practitioners. Productive MEG clinics are those who have invested in the brain power to compensate for these commercial lacunae. © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

The sensitivity and therefore the spatial resolution of MEG source imaging are indeed uneven across the brain: for instance, superficial cortical sources produce MEG signals up to 100 times stronger than deeper, subcortical structures at equivalent current strengths 43,44 . However, there is both modeling 45 and increasing experimental evidence that with optimized paradigm designs and signal extraction techniques, brain regions as deep as the insula 46 , thalamus 47 , hippocampus 48 , amygdala 49–51 and brainstem 52,53 can be resolved with MEG. Concerning the influence of current flow direction, brain regions in sulcal walls (tangential current flow) produce MEG signals that are stronger than sources along gyral crowns (radial current flow). We also emphasize that, SNR differential effects notwithstanding, the ori­ entation of primary currents affects positively the spatial resolution of MEG source imaging: recent empirical results in the visual cortex indi­ cate that the activity of cortical locations separated by about 0.5 mm can be resolved if the angle between their respective current flow is at least 45°, a range compatible with typical cortical gyrification 54 . These results confirm simulation studies that demonstrate the sensitivity of MEG signals to minute changes between cortical layers 55 and at the sub-millimeter scale of cortical columns 56 . All these factors influencing the sensitivity of MEG source imaging are fully characterized quantitatively from the physical forward model of an individual’s anatomy. SNR can also be estimated routinely using empty-room recordings, with no participant under the sensor array. This is another advantage of MEG with respect to EEG, for which actual skin contact of the electrodes is required. Nevertheless, with substantial operating costs and a capital invest­ ment that compares to that of an MRI scanner, a research organization needs further reasons to support the initiation and development of an MEG program. The comparison with MRI is relatively unfair: in the early years, a crucial factor that facilitated the development of MRI neuroimaging research was the fast-growing installation of clinical scanners that were also made partially available to researchers. Hence scientists were not required to primarily cover the platform’s operat­ ing costs. The clinical recommendation and recognition for MEG, although growing 57 ( Box 1 ), have not been sufficient yet to increase the number of clinical MEG units to a level that would facilitate access to the broadest research community. Hence, the decision to initiate and maintain an MEG program is a matter of institutional research strategy. The initiative needs to be supported by a sufficiently large and diverse critical mass of investigators intrigued by the assets of the technique. Financially, a clear plan needs to be laid out so that operating costs can be assumed by a combination of fees for access and institutional funds. Strategically, MEG imaging represents a strong scientific asset in the neuroscience portfolio of a research intensive institution: it is directly sensitive to neural electrophysiology and therefore independent of a signal transduction model. The millisecond temporal resolution of neural signal dynamics across the entire brain is obviously another hallmark of MEG compared to functional MRI (fMRI), positron emis­ sion tomography (PET) or optical techniques 58 . We have seen that multiple factors expose EEG imaging to uncontrolled sources of local­ ization bias. Other electrophysiological methods, such as intracranial stereotactic EEG and electrocorticographic implants, have obvious limitations in terms of invasiveness, and coverage of the cerebrum is confined to a limited number of disease-prone regions. Other practical advantages over in-bore scanning with PET and fMRI include a safe, quiet and open environment inducing minimal claustrophobic stress, especially in special populations, with posture adjustable anywhere between upright and supine. Ferromagnetic elements used in dental works and implants can cause complex arti­ facts 59 but, unlike in MRI, do not pose safety concerns. MEG also offers remarkably versatile concurrent signal acquisition and analytic combination opportunities for the realization of genuine multimodal studies, with high-density scalp EEG 60,61 , intracranial local field potentials 62–64 , deep-brain 65,66 and scalp 67,68 current stimu­ lation devices; all kinds of peripheral measures to study their coupling with brain activity (eye tracking and pupil diameter, heart rate, skin conductance, muscle electrophysiology, motion capture, behavioral equipment, etc.); and real-time neurofeedback 69,70 . Reduced analytic complexity for greater adoption. One recurrent bottleneck to the broader adoption of MEG has been the perceived intricacies of its data workflow. The reasons are multifaceted ( Fig. 3 ). First, MEG signals are rich and complex: we will review in the next section how this is a matter of active research. Still, it also remains a source of uncertainty to MEG users. They therefore need to be offered the best possible guidance to define the signals of interest in their data and navigate the plethora of signal extraction measures avail­ able. A constructive stance is to encourage investigators to formulate their research hypotheses in terms of electrophysiological markers (for example, event-related responses, oscillatory components, cross- frequency interactions, inter-regional coherence, etc.) of mecha­ nisms related to a theoretical framework. Exploratory MEG studies are essentially bound to fail, considering the volume of data and the analysis dimensions enabled by MEG’s mass electrophysiology. Another element that has somewhat inhibited MEG’s development is that, as in EEG, the physics principles underlying source imaging are fundamentally ill-posed. This means that an infinite number of source models can fit the sensor data equivalently well. Such manifestation of mathematical ill-posedness is very common in many fields of physics, signal detection and estimation theory, and can be addressed with sound methodological principles 5 .

Like other brain imaging modalities, MEG requires that several important procedures be followed in data analytics. (1) The preprocessing steps are crucial to assure that data quality is optimal at the time of collection and before engaging sophisticated signal extraction procedures. Data segments contaminated by artifacts need to be identified and rejected or attenuated. (2) The modeling stage for MEG imaging requires that a few important options for parameters selection be considered carefully (for example, template versus individual head shape, noise definition, image reconstruction parameters). (3) Signal extraction usually depends on the design of the experiment and is very versatile in MEG. (4) The set of possible measures is immense because of the multidimensional components of the data (space, time, frequency). (5) The final statistical steps can either include inference and hypothesis testing, or statistical learning techniques for signal classification, and other derivatives. © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

This did not contribute to building con­ fidence among potentially new users of MEG. Fortunately, this phase has receded: the methods have grown mature and pragmatic, with now high-quality commercial and academic software packages that have greatly augmented users’ access to training, their productivity and their deeper understanding of methods and their limitations 71 . Opportunities for machine learning and big-data neuroscience. New approaches to MEG signal analysis have recently spun off from the tremendous developments and growing availability of data clas­ sification and feature extraction techniques, based on the principles of machine learning 72 . These methods emerged only recently in the MEG arena, although they are already demonstrating very significant potential in augmenting the scientist’s toolkit. Relatively simple implementation of machine-learning decoding techniques for multidimensional signal classification showed impres­ sive applications in identifying early components of visual object categorization 73 and in tracking the temporal organization of spatial patterns of brain activity 74 or that of a mnemonic template in the context of perceptual decisions 75 . The fact that these methods are, for now, fairly independent of signal models make them an attractive complement to MEG researchers for rapid evaluation of their data— for example, to assess the presence and spatiotemporal topography of effects between experimental conditions or cohorts. Such approaches were recently and beautifully extended to joint multimodal process­ ing of MEG and fMRI data 76 : a form of machine learning–based conjunction analysis of similar representations of features in both datasets resulted in fMRI voxel clusters being animated with MEG’s millisecond temporal resolution. Representations similarity analyzes of a similar kind were also extended to the joint processing of MEG data with the outputs of a deep neural network, respectively obtained from and trained on the same visual categorization task 77 . This highly innovative, multimodal approach promises to take best advantage of neuromimetic models to refine, and maybe discover, new mecha­ nistic principles of brain function, potentially generalizable to other functional systems and patient populations. The present renaissance of artificial intelligence methods is also boosted by access to readily available computing and large data storage a b c A R 25 100 50 75 % deviant measures Debbie Maizels/Springer Nature Delta (2–4 Hz) Theta (5–7 Hz) Alpha (8–12 Hz) Beta (15–19 Hz) Gamma (30–59 Hz) –0.2 0.2 0.4 0 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 Probability density P < 0.05 Individual data Regional and measure-specific normal variants (empirical distribution) Arbitrary units Figure 4 Toward big-data MEG.

MEG imaging of their cortical activity was performed using the same method as for Figure 2 . The average distribution of the magnitude of ongoing brain rhythms (from delta to gamma) found in the cohort are registered to and represented on the Colin27 brain template cortical surface. Data were thresholded at 50% of maximum amplitude across the cortex. ( b ) Large data repositories such as OMEGA can be used to establish normative and patient variants of any analytic measure taken from MEG source signals. This is illustrated here, where for each measure and each brain location, the values obtained in a tested individual or group dataset can be assessed with respect to their empirical distribution in the databank. ( c ) Practical summarizing and visualization solutions can reveal the anatomical locations where, for example, a single or cumulated measures from the individual data from one patient deviate from those observed in the reference normative repository. Here, for instance, the colored brain locations indicate where abnormal strengths of oscillatory brain activity have been detected in the resting state and in multiple frequency bands in a patient with epilepsy. © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

More generally, resorting to big-data tools and methods is becoming increasingly strategic in neuroscience research involving brain imaging: analysis pipelines have grown in sophistication, and data volumes have inflated concurrently with the augmented spatial and temporal resolution of instruments. There is also a growing sci­ entific motivation to combine multiple data types (genotypes, imaging and behavioral phenotypes, clinical data, tissue samples, etc.), which transforms every research participant’s record in a big-data volume. In parallel, community awareness is now growing toward expanding the curated value and lifetime of data collections in public research: the increasing number of open data-sharing initiatives emphasize and incarnate stronger educational, economical, ethical and societal values in science 78 . For the neuroimaging community, this repre­ sents a vital opportunity to validate methods more thoroughly and to overcome the limitations of small-sample, low-powered and conse­ quently poorly reproducible studies that are eventually detrimental to the credibility of the field 79 . Until recently, MEG was lagging behind MRI in that respect 80–82 . Reasons include the lack of a standard file format for MEG raw data and the large volume occupied by high-density recordings (typically >100 MB per minute). Fortunately, these bottlenecks are gradually, and at least partially, being overcome by the increasing availabil­ ity and versatility of software readers for most native data formats. Storage capacity, especially in the cloud, has now become ubiquitous and more affordable. The Human Connectome Project was first to distribute MEG data on a large scale, from a subsample of its cohort, along with extensive multimodal MRI, behavioral and genetic data 83 . With about 150 data volumes available, the Open MEG Archives (OMEGA) is the second-largest repository of resting-state MEG data, and it contains T1-weighted MRI volumes of participants 84 ( Fig. 4a ). The recent CAM-CAN initiative features data from about 650 healthy participants ages 18–88, combined with multimodal MRI and exten­ sive cognitive testing 85 . We rejoice that more of these initiatives are on the horizon, as they will with no doubt increasingly contribute to improving data integ­ rity and consistency across sites, reproducibility of research results, and the development and benchmarking of new analysis methods that were statistically too low powered with smaller data cohorts ( Fig. 4b ). Finally, flexible statistical inference methods based on non-parametric approaches have been designed to adequately han­ dle the multiple dimensions of MEG data (space, frequency and time, typically) and efficiently control for multiple comparisons in hypothesis testing 86,87 . To conclude, MEG occupies a unique, strong position in the land­ scape of human neuroscience techniques. Conceptually and effec­ tively, it plays a privileged and scientifically significant role in bridging human electrophysiology with other imaging signals and modalities. The access the technique provides to large-scale neurodynamics is a tremendous opportunity to bridge the study of human brain activity with the mechanisms identified and readily testable with animal and disease model electrophysiology, as we shall see in the next section. A window on large-scale neurodynamics Many researchers who are new to MEG find themselves puzzled, if not frustrated, by the sheer volume and complexity of experimental data produced. What is signal? Is this noise? How to implement a test to detect signal changes between experimental conditions? How to meas­ ure functional connectivity? These interrogations are active research topics in MEG. They contribute to the broader objective of compre­ hending and exploiting how brain activation, in terms of regional and large-scale neural dynamics, is expressed in electrophysiology 88 . Yet many potential users of MEG are under the impression that the field is not mature enough or that the technique is too complicated alto­ gether. All things considered, these are questions that actually concern all electrophysiology and imaging methods: the apparent simplicity of fMRI data and of some widely used analysis pipelines, for instance, should not mask their intrinsic limitations 89,90 and the share of fragility in their methodological assumptions and sophistication 91 . MEG signals: rich and complex. Event-related components such as ERFs represent only a small fraction of the wealth of information present in MEG signals. One key scientific objective is indeed to understand how transient or tonic responses emerge from and reshape the busy resting-state activity of the brain 92,93 . This represents a conceptual, and somewhat iconoclastic, shift from the classical tradition of considering spontaneous, ongoing brain activity as ‘neural noise’. It is necessary, though, to comprehend the rich expressions of distributed and interdependent neural dynam­ ics available in MEG signals and to make the most of the modality’s imaging capacity. Electrophysiology is not the only domain of biology undergoing a similar change of paradigm, exploiting the higher order statistics of experimental measures beyond the tradi­ tional trial or group average. Bridging with other imaging modalities and animal electrophysi­ ology contributes to a deeper comprehension of the nature of brain signals observed with MEG imaging 94 . For instance, the explosion of interest in fMRI resting-state and task-based connectomics prompts the identification of equivalent signaling mechanisms in neural elec­ trophysiology 95,96 . Counterintuitively, there is little correspondence between MEG and fMRI resting-state networks when MEG source signals are extracted in the frequency bands that show the strongest correlation between electrophysiology and fMRI, namely gamma 97,98 , Default-mode network Visual network A P R L a b Alpha: 8–12 Hz Beta: 15–25 Hz Gamma: 40–80 Hz Resting-state networks as modes of phase-amplitude coupling Dorsal, sensorimotor network Auditory+ network Modes of frequency-specific coherent activity Figure 5 Frequency-dependent expressions of inter-regional connectivity. ( a ) Illustration of frequency-dependent functional connectivity measures. MEG source imaging of 5-min resting-state (eyes open) data in typical alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands was obtained using the same methodology as in Figure 4 (the strengths of cortical currents are not shown here; data sample from OMEGA 84 ). Coherence in all frequency bands of interest between every pair of cortical source locations was extracted and thresholded above the 90th percentile. Virtual white-matter tracing yields convenient and anatomically compatible representations (shown here for visualization purposes) of such complex, multidimensional connectivity data (S. Dery and S.B., unpublished data). ( b ) Resting-state networks obtained with MEG imaging. Regions that demonstrate similar dynamics of phase amplitude coupling fluctuations over minutes of resting-state MEG recordings segregate in networks that are similar to those found in fMRI.

In fact, MEG time series in the beta range (15–35 Hz), when processed with fMRI-like data-driven resting-state pipelines, were first to reveal rest­ ing-state networks compatible with fMRI’s topography 100 . Studies had shown indeed that local field potentials in the beta band were weakly negatively correlated with blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) traces 99 . Gamma and the slower BOLD-correlated frequency bands (delta through alpha) were later shown to also form an electrophysi­ ological scaffold for resting-state networks 101 , when combined using cross-frequency coupling measures translated from animal and intracranial human electrophysiology 102 ( Figs. 5 and 6b ). Bringing everything together: polyrhythmic mechanisms of brain functions. Taken together, and although seemingly complicated, these observations are actually mutually compatible when consid­ ering a mechanistic construction. Here we propose one possible model of polyrhythmic integration to reconcile published reports that are seemingly disparate across the frequency spectrum of Signal power (arbitrary units) 1 10 100 Frequency (Hz) Frequency (Hz) δ θ α δ – α β γ γ β β β 250 40 250 40 250 40 a b Expected Expected Expected Debbie Maizels/Springer Nature Phase resetting d SI FI E c 7.5 Hz 5 Hz 9 Hz 2.6 Hz 5 Hz 3 Hz 6 Hz 20 Hz –500 500 –500 –500 500 500 Time (ms) Time (ms) Time (ms) –Max Relative power Max Dynamical relaying Unpredicted Input Net inhibition Input SI FI E SI FI E Figure 6 A possible mechanistic framework of polyrhythmic brain activity. ( a ) A typical power density spectrum (80-s resting-state data from a 55-year-old healthy adult with eyes open; Welch’s method, 2-s windowing) shows the distribution of power averaged across all 275 channels of a CTF MEG system. Typical brain rhythms are marked; note the prominent peak in power in the 8- to 12-Hz alpha range. ( b ) These rhythms are coupled and interdependent, which can be revealed by measures of cross-frequency interaction, such as phase–amplitude coupling (PAC). Here, PAC analysis of MEG traces obtained in the resting-state (10 min) of a healthy 40-year-old adult (eyes open) shows that the amplitude of gamma activity is modulated by the phase of slower oscillations. Each panel indicates (i) the average of ongoing MEG source time series epoched on a [–0.5, 0.5] s time window about the trough of the local slow oscillation the most highly coupled with fast gamma activity in the 80- to 150-Hz range and (ii) the average time–frequency decomposition of the power of the MEG source signal, indicating how it is modulated with the phase of the underlying oscillation (see ref. 101 for details). The colored dots indicate the locations on the cortex where the sample signals were extracted. ( c ) The slower delta to alpha rhythms mark the net excitability of cell assemblies consisting of slow and fast inhibitory (SI and FI, respectively) and excitatory (E) cells. Possible theoretical frameworks for the organization of brain rhythms, such as the model of synchronized gating 101 and others 140,141 , consider brain network formation and communication to be enabled by the phase alignment of these cycles between regions. This can be facilitated by the mechanism of dynamical relaying 142 via the thalamus or cortical hub regions. While gamma bursts could contribute to bottom-up signaling (black arrows), beta bursts could manifest top-down modulations of upstream regions (magenta arrows) and thereby contribute to the implementation of contextual predictive inference of input signals. ( d ) Such a dynamical scaffold, among others possible, helps formulate testable hypotheses from MEG signals. For instance, the occurrence of a stimulus (input) interferes with the ongoing E/I dynamics in a primary sensory region. This may provoke the resetting of the phase of local E/I cycles and trigger the temporal prediction of the next stimulus occurrence via an afferent volley of beta oscillations. This process repeats and paces the net inhibition of the local cell assembly according to the next anticipated stimulus occurrences. Such a model predicts that input signals to a brain network would fall optimally at the phase of maximum net excitability of the input node. One consequence would be to maximize the perceptual processing of the stimulus by facilitating the relaying of its neural representation downstream 106 . © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

The purpose is essentially to propose a roadmap to guide future research, including the formation of test­ able hypotheses for scientists interested in MEG. At the mesoscopic regional scale, slower rhythms (delta through alpha) mark the phase of relative excitability of cell assemblies 10,103 . Gamma bursts tend to occur in volleys nested at certain phases of these slower rhythms, a well-studied phenomenon of coupling across frequencies captured by, for example, phase–amplitude coupling 104,105 measures ( Fig. 6a , b ). There is increasing evidence 106 that gamma cycles could represent timed opportunities for neural representations of, for example, incoming stimuli to be registered by cell assemblies and propagated further downstream in a bottom-up fashion. Beta oscillations so far have not been found to pace gamma bursts and do not seem to be driven directly by colocalized slower rhythms in the human resting state 101 . According to computational models and nascent experimental data 107 , they are rather thought to signal top-down modulations from higher order, executive regions in brain networks ( Fig. 6c , d ). A global roadmap for MEG to build on these recent and still rela­ tively sparse advances would ideally consist in (i) further clarifying the physiological principles structuring the local-to-global dynamics of neural oscillations, (ii) defining measures of regional activation and inter-areal communication in brain systems that are driven by these biological principles (iii) using these measures to survey the dynamical repertoire of the resting brain, which remains largely uncharted, and (iv) understanding how sensory inputs interact with this repertoire, enabling functional integration and eventually behav­ ior. Approaching future MEG research with this plan would open considerable perspectives—for instance, by verifying that aberrant repertoire phenotypes are expressed in diseases. This would enable a new generation of electrophysiological markers of pathology and eventually new forms of intervention. Contributions to neuroscience Research productivity. Our bibliographic survey (source: Web of Knowledge) indicates that, in volume, the yearly production of scientific publications concerning MEG has been increasing over the past 25 years. About 750 indexed journal articles and conference pro­ ceeding entries are published on an annual basis ( Fig. 7a ). However, although fMRI and PET were developed more recently, fMRI some 20 years after MEG, their respective volume of research production approaches three (for PET) to eight (for fMRI) times that of MEG’s. The historically oldest technique of all, EEG, remains the leading inte­ grative neuroscience tool, with fMRI as a close runner-up.

One par­ ticular distinction of MEG with respect to EEG’s considerable volume of research is source imaging and modeling as a particular topic of interest. This concerns only about 6% of all EEG research, compared to at least one-third in MEG. We also note that since the turn of the twenty-first century, the research output of all techniques has been slowly declining relatively to fMRI’s ( Fig. 7b ). MEG at present contributes 5% of the neuroscience research that uses the techniques surveyed, although with increasing impact ( Fig. 7c ). As of 2015, about 10,400 articles cited published MEG research, with an average of eight citations per MEG article. Further, the geographic distribution of the community shows healthy diversity ( Fig. 7d ) and growing stamina: in a 5-year period around 1990, 52 organizations had researchers publishing with MEG. This number grew to 433 around the year 2000 and is now above 1,000 research organizations involved in or collaborating on MEG research over the past 5 years. Highlights. We have already reviewed the unique contributions and potential of MEG for studying the large-scale dynamics of brain activ­ ity. This represents the strongest scientific asset of the technique. More thematically, MEG users have been investigating the principal topics of systems and behavioral neuroscience, with greater representation from systems, cognitive and clinical research studies, the strong pres­ ence of methodological developments, and emerging themes such as resting-state brain research ( Fig. 7e ). Excellent topical reviews are available to dive into each subfield in detail: methods 109 ; the inte­ grative neuroscience of language 110 ; consciousness 111,112 ; and trans­ lational aspects of clinical neuroscience, including epilepsy 113,114 , autism spectrum disorders 115 and movement disorders 116 . We wish to highlight an experimental approach that is not specific to the modality, but which has gained significant momentum in MEG. It consists in entraining neural systems with steady-state sensory stimulation or detecting brain activity that is temporally coherent with behavioral or peripheral measures, such as movement param­ eters. Such experimental models take great advantage of the tempo­ ral resolution of the technique and enhance SNR by ‘tagging’ neural responses with stimulus-imposed or stimulus-induced frequencies of interest. A body of compelling work has grown in audition 117 , includ­ ing prosodic features of natural speech 118,119 and music 120 perception; vision 121,122 ; attention 123,124 and motor system 125 research using such methodology. The reader may refer to our annotated bibliography and other recent reviews 9,126 for more detailed highlights of MEG contributions to neuroscience. Conclusions We have reviewed MEG as a neuroimaging modality in its own right, for the widest range of integrative neuroscience research topics. Although its scientific presence is strong, MEG could attract a larger and broader community of scientists. Advances in research methods and practical tools are now available to make MEG more accessible. Although the signals are complex, their extraction and interpre­ tation can be facilitated by the emergence of testable mechanistic frameworks of interdependent neural dynamics. Like those for MRI and PET, initiatives to share large MEG data openly in repositories are now well underway. This is bene­ ficial to establishing normative and disease-specific variants of electrophysiological activity and to the reproducibility and generaliza­ tion of research methods and results. Commercial entities could at present better manage the expecta­ tions of practitioners to avoid misconceptions about MEG as a routine clinical modality. Looking forward, they could make stronger efforts toward the integration of research tools into certified analytic pipelines. This would with no doubt increase the yield of MEG in the epilepsy clinic and see the modality penetrate more subspecialties of neurology and neuropsychiatry. We also emphasize that MEG is a technique that readily bridges with other measures and methods such as electrophysiology (intracranial local field potential recordings and scalp EEG), blood flow and oxygen metabolism (near infrared spectroscopy), brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial alternating current stimula­ tion), all of which can be performed concurrently with MEG. This offers researchers tremendous opportunities to cross-validate findings between techniques and between human and animal bodies of work, and to build on the superaddition of jointly processed multimodal data volumes. To conclude, the sensitivity of MEG to a large spectrum of fast, oscillatory brain signals, combined with its superior ability to map their anatomical origins, makes it a powerful tool for verifying predic­ tions from theoretical frameworks concerning brain functions, the mechanisms of directed connectivity in brain networks 127,128 and, more generally, perception and behavior as biological expressions of predictive inference 129–131 .

A thorough review of how MEG imaging contributes to elucidating the brain networks affected in a variety of movement disorders. The method for dynamic imaging of coherent sources is reviewed as a means to identify and analyze cerebral oscillatory networks in health and pathology with MEG.

The pace of prosodic phrasing couples the listener’s cortex to the reader’s voice. Hum. Brain Mapp. 34 , 314–326 (2013). A great demonstration of coupling between auditory speech signals and cortical activity using an ecologically valid continuous listening task. This study illustrates the capacity of MEG to produce brain maps of activity that are coherent with a peripheral, natural signal; here, throat contractions from the speech production of an individual. The temporal resolution of MEG imaging enabled the comparison between brain activity related to multiple temporal scales in speech rhythm and phrasing . 119.\t Ding, N., Melloni, L., Zhang, H., Tian, X. & Poeppel, D. Cortical tracking of hierarchical linguistic structures in connected speech. Nat. Neurosci. 19 , 158–164 (2016). Another beautiful example of how MEG can track the brain activity related to the multiscale dynamics of sensory and speech signals. Results show that cortical activity at different timescales corresponded to the time course of abstract linguistic structures at different hierarchical levels, such as words, phrases and sentences . 120.\t Doelling, K.B. & Poeppel, D. Cortical entrainment to music and its modulation by expertise. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 112 , E6233–E6242 (2015). The dynamical ability of brain signals to be entrained by speech at multiple time scales corresponding to various hierarchical structures of spoken language (see previous two references) are further tested here in the context of music perception, with an emphasis on musical training. The data from musicians show that cortical entrainment is enhanced by years of musical training . 121.\t Cottereau, B. et al. Phase delays within visual cortex shape the response to steady-state visual stimulation. Neuroimage 54 , 1919–1929 (2011). Tonic visual responses in occipital cortex are induced by steady-state stimulation. The study shows how such procedures enhance SNR in MEG imaging. It also allows measurement of phase differences between stimulus properties and responses at different brain sites that can be converted into time delays caused by neural signal propagation and/or processing . 122.\t Koelewijn, L., Rich, A.N., Muthukumaraswamy, S.D. & Singh, K.D. Spatial attention increases high-frequency gamma synchronisation in human medial visual cortex. Neuroimage 79 , 295–303 (2013). MEG was used to explore sustained gamma activity in human early visual cortex, a hallmark of processes engaged by spatial attention. These signals are more ambiguous in EEG owing to possible confounds from muscle activity or eye saccades. Results show that stimulus- and goal-driven modulations of attention may be mediated at different frequencies within the gamma range in the early visual cortex . 123.\t Baldauf, D. & Desimone, R. Neural mechanisms of object-based attention. Science 344 , 424–427 (2014). The authors used MEG and fMRI to separate rapid neuronal responses to attended and unattended objects. Delays as short as 20 ms between frontal and parahippocampal and basal posterior temporal regions were identified in a directed manner via measures of coupled oscillations. This study is a beautiful example of how MEG imaging contributes to identifying the dynamical flow of information processing in the brain . 124.\t Landau, A.N., Schreyer, H.M., van Pelt, S. & Fries, P. Distributed attention is implemented through theta-rhythmic gamma modulation. Curr. Biol. 25 , 2332–2337 (2015). This article provides more compelling evidence that the phase of ongoing brain rhythms around 8 Hz that precede the onset of target stimuli of interest influences performance. Specifically, the authors test how this 8-Hz rhythm can implement the sequential sampling of multiple target locations in relation to gamma fluctuations in a visual attention task and explain the observed decrease in behavioral performances. The MEG findings suggest that theta rhythms implement an attentional sampling process that is continual and synchronized with power fluctuations in the gamma band . 125.\t Jerbi, K. et al. Coherent neural representation of hand speed in humans revealed by MEG imaging. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104 , 7676–7681 (2007). This study is another demonstration of the powerful approach that consists in revealing the brain regions whose MEG source activity is coherent with a signal of reference. Results show that theta-band activity in sensorimotor regions is coherent with the instantaneous velocity of contralateral hand movements. The study also shows that further coherent cortico-cortical activity during movement performance spreads in a network of regions involving the supplementary motor area, dorsal parietal lobules and the ipsilateral cerebellum . 126.\t Hari, R. & Salmelin, R.
