Current in vivo imaging techniques not only provide clin- ically essential information and allow new forms of treatment but also reveal insights into the mechanisms behind brain function and malfunc- tion. This supremacy of modern imaging rests on its ability to study the structural properties of the nervous system simultaneously with the func- tional changes related to neuronal activity. As a result, imaging allows us to combine information about the spatial organization and connectivity of the nervous system with information about the underlying neuronal processes and provides the only means to link perception and cognition with the neural substrates in the human brain. Functional imaging techniques build on the inter- connections of cerebral blood flow (CBF), the brain’s energy demand and the neuronal activity (for reviews on this topic, see Heeger and Ress 2002 ; Logothetis 2002 ; Logothetis and Wandell 2004 ; Lauritzen 2005 ). Indeed, elaborate mecha- nisms exist to couple changes in CBF and blood oxygenation to the maintenance and restoration of ionic gradients and the synthesis, transport and reuptake of neurotransmitters. More than 125 years ago, Angelo Mosso had already real- ized that there must be a relation between energy demand and CBF when he observed increasing brain pulsations in a patient with a permanent skull defect performing a mental task (Mosso 1881 ). Similar observations on the coupling of blood flow to neuronal activity (from experi- ments on animals) led Roy and Sherrington to make the insightful statement that “… the chemi- cal products of cerebral metabolism contained in the lymph that bathes the walls of the arterioles of the brain can cause variations of the calibre of the cerebral vessels: that is, in this reaction, the brain possesses an intrinsic mechanism by which its vascular supply can be varied locally in cor- respondence with local variations of functional activity” (Roy and Sherrington 1890 ). Nowadays, there is little doubt about the use- fulness of imaging to basic research and clinical diagnosis. In fact, with the wide availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional imaging has become a self-sustaining branch of neuroscience research. Yet, and despite all this progress, it is still not clear how faithfully func- tional imaging replicates the patterns of neuronal activity underlying the changes in brain perfusion. Debating over the spatial and temporal ­precision C.

Logothetis Department Physiology of Cognitive Processes, Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tübingen, Germany 3 \n16 of the imaging signal, researchers have compared it to more direct measurements of electrical neuro- nal activity from electrophysiological approaches. This holds especially true for the blood-oxygen- ation level-dependent signal (BOLD-fMRI), which is probably the most widely used functional imaging technique (Ogawa et al. 1998 ). As direct measurements of neuronal activity can be obtained from mesoscopic recordings of electrical poten- tials on the scalp (EEG) as well as from spatially localized recordings using fine microelectrodes, they offer a wide variety of signals that charac- terize neuronal processes. Hence, before review- ing the neurophysiological basis of the functional imaging signal, it is worth considering the prop- erties of the signals recorded using electrophysi- ological methods. 3.2 \u0007The Compound Neural Signal Electrophysiological studies at the system level typically record extracellular signals, defined by the superposition of local currents. In con- trast to the intracellular recordings that directly assess the membrane potential of individual neurons, extracellular signals can arise from a number of sources and are more difficult to inter- pret. Neurons are embedded in the extracellu- lar medium, which acts as a volume conductor, allowing the passive spread of electrical signals across considerable spatial distances. For an extracellular recording point, the inflow of posi- tively charged ions into the active sites of a neu- ron appears as a current sink (inward currents), while inactive membrane sites act as a source (outward currents) for the active regions. Given the resistive nature of the extracellular medium, these currents generate so-called extracellular field potentials (EFP) (Freeman 1975 ). The sig- nal measured by an electrode placed at a neural site represents the mean EFP from the spatially weighted sum of sinks and sources along mul- tiple cells at this particular site. In addition, by the superposition principle, the EFPs from mul- tiple cells add up linearly throughout the volume conductor. Thus, for cells or cell compartments, with diametrically opposite orientations, currents of equal magnitude but opposite polarity will generate potentials that tend to cancel each other, while for well-aligned and elongated processes of neural elements, the currents add, resulting in a strongly oriented electric field. Despite these difficulties in interpreting the measured signals, EFP remains the most important tool for the sys- tems neurophysiologist, as they convey a great deal of information about the underlying brain function. If a small-tipped microelectrode is placed sufficiently close to the soma or axon of a neu- ron, then the measured EFP directly reports the spike (action potentials) of that neuron and pos- sibly also of its immediate neighbours. The fir- ing rates of such well-isolated neurons have been the critical measure for comparing neural activ- ity with sensory processing or behaviour ever since the early development of microelectrodes (Adrian and Zotterman 1929 ). Indeed, measur- ing firing rates has been the mainstay of systems neuroscience for decades. Although a great deal has been learned from this measure of neuronal activity, the single-unit technique has the draw- back of not providing information about sub- threshold integrative processes or associational operations taking place at a given site. In addi- tion, this recording technique suffers from a bias toward certain cell types and sizes (Towe and Harding 1970 ; Stone 1973 ). For large neurons, the active and passive regions are further apart, resulting in a substantially greater flow of mem- brane current and a larger extracellular spike than for a small cell. As a result, spikes generated by large neurons will remain above noise level over a greater distance from the cell than spikes from small neurons. It follows that typically measured spiking activity mostly represents the small pop- ulation of large cells, which are the pyramidal cells in the neocortex. This bias is particularly pronounced in experiments with alert-behaving animals or humans, in which even slight move- ments of the subjects make it extremely difficult to record from smaller neurons for a sufficiently long time (Fried et al. 1997 ; Kreiman et al. 2000 ). As a result, most of the experiments using single- unit extracellular recordings report on the activity C. Kayser and N. K. Logothetis \n17 of large principal cells, which represent the out- put of the cortical area under study. If the impedance of the microelectrode is sufficiently low or when no clear signal from individual neurons can be isolated, then the electrode can be used to monitor the totality of the action potentials in that region. Often, the multiunit activity (MUA) is characterized as compound electrical signal in a frequency range above 300–500 Hz. This signal has been shown to be site specific (Buchwald and Grover 1970 ) and to vary systematically with stimulus proper- ties in the same way as the activity of single neu- rons (e.g. Kayser et al. ( 2007a )). There is good evidence that MUA activity reflects variations in the magnitude of extracellular spike potentials, with large-amplitude signal variations in the MUA reflecting large-amplitude extracellular potentials. Overall, the MUA seems to incorpo- rate signals from a sphere with a radius of 150– 300  mm, depending on the detailed electrode properties (Buchwald and Grover 1970 ; Legatt et al. 1980 ; Gray et al. 1989 ). Typically, such a region will contain thousands of neurons, sug- gesting that the MUA is especially sensitive to the synchronous firings of many cells, which is further enhanced by the principle of superposi- tion mentioned above. While the fast, high-frequency components of the aggregate field potentials mostly reflect the spiking activity of neighbouring neurons, the slower components of the EFP seem to reflect a different kind of activity. The so-called local field potential (LFP) is defined as the low-frequency component of the EFP and represents mostly slow events reflecting cooperative activity in neural populations. In contrast to the MUA, the magnitude of the LFP does not correlate with cell size but instead reflects the extent and geometry of local dendrites (Fromm and Bond 1964 , 1967 ; Buchwald et  al. 1966 ). A prominent geometric arrangement is formed by the pyramidal neurons with their apical dendrites running parallel to each other and perpendicular to the pial surface. They form a so-called open field arrangement, in which dendrites face in one direction and somata in another, producing strong dendrite-to-soma dipoles when they are activated by synchronous synaptic input. The spatial summation of the LFP has been suggested to reflect a weighted average of synchronized dendrosomatic components of the synaptic signals of a neural population within 0.5–3  mm of the electrode tip (Mitzdorf 1985 , 1987 ; Juergens et al. 1999 ). The upper limits of the spatial extent of LFP summation were indirectly calculated by computing the phase coherence as a function of interelectrode distance in experiments with simultaneous multiple-­electrode recordings (e.g. see Fig. 3.1 ). Combined intracellular and field potential recordings also suggest a synaptic/ dendritic origin of the LFPs, representing locally averaged excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, which are considerably slower than the spiking activity (Steriade and Amzica 1994 ; Steriade et  al. 1998 ). In addition, the LFP can also include other types of slow activity unrelated to synaptic events, including voltage-dependent membrane oscillations (Juergens et al. 1999 ) and spike after potentials (Buzsaki et al. 1988 ). In summary, three different signals can com- monly be extracted from extracellular micro- electrode recordings, each partially covering a different frequency regime of the acquired sig- nal.

Covering the same frequency range, the single-unit activity reports mainly on the activity of the principal neurons that form the major output of a cortical area. In contrast and representing slower events, the LFP reflects slow waveforms such as synaptic potentials, afterpo- tentials and voltage-gated membrane oscillations that mostly reflect the input of a given cortical area as well as its local intracortical processing. 3.3 \u0007The Passive Electric Properties of the Brain To better understand how the signal picked up by a microelectrode emerges from the underly- ing neuronal processes, especially with regard to the distinction of the different frequency regimes, it is important to know the basic electrical prop- erties of brain tissue. The extracellular micro- environment consists of narrow gaps between cellular processes, probably not more than 200 Å wide on average. These spaces form a complex three-­dimensional mosaic filled with extracellu- lar fluid. Theoretical considerations suggest that currents and ions spread within this fluid but not through the cells (Robinson 1968 ). As a result, the resistance to electrical currents of this space depends on the detailed spatial layout of neuro- nal tissue, possibly resulting in an un-isotropic current flow that does not necessarily behave like that in a simple saline bath (Ranck 1963a , b ; Mitzdorf 1985 ). Especially, from these con- siderations, it is unclear whether cortical tissue behaves like an ohmic resistor or whether signals of different frequencies experience frequency-­ dependent attenuation, that is, whether the tissue behaves like a capacitive filter. A frequency-dependent behaviour was sug- gested by the fact that the activity of the slow wave measured by the EEG is largely independent of spiking responses, suggesting strong frequency-­ filtering properties of the tissue overlying the sources of the activity (Ajmone-Marsan 1965 ; Bedard et al. 2004 , 2006 ). In addition, in extra- cellular unit recordings, the shape and amplitude of recorded spikes depend on the spatial position of the electrode relative to the neuron (Gold et al. 2006 ), while slow potentials show much less sen- sitivity to position and correlate over large spatial distances. Since the lower frequencies of the field potentials typically correlate over larger spatial distances than the higher frequencies of the same signal (Fig. 3.1 ), this can be interpreted as strong evidence for the cortical tissue to behave as a capacitive filter (Destexhe et  al. 1999 ). Such a frequency-dependent impedance spectrum could selectively attenuate electric signals of some fre- quencies more than those of others, for example, high-frequency spiking events more than low- frequency potentials. To clarify whether the brain’s tissue behaves like an ohmic or a capacitive medium, we recently quantified the passive electrical spread of different signals in the brain in vivo. These measurements were conducted in the primary visual cortex, a typical model system for sensory processing, and on the scale of hundreds of micrometres to several millimetres, that is, the scale relevant to the typical functional imaging techniques such as fMRI-BOLD (Logothetis et al. 2007 ). At this scale, theoretical considerations suggest that the extracellular medium can be considered as largely homogenous and mostly isotropic (within the grey matter). Our results confirmed this and, more importantly, demonstrated that the cortical tissue does not behave like a capacitive filter but acts like an ohmic resistor, attenuating signals of different frequencies in the same manner. In detail, we measured the voltage drop across two neighbouring electrodes induced by an injected current of predefined frequency (Fig. 3.2 ). Our measurements employed a four-­ point electrode system, allowing highly accurate and unperturbed measurements of resistance of cortical tissue in vivo. Over a wide range of cur- rent frequencies and for all tested spatial arrange- ments of the electrodes, the brain’s grey matter tissue behaved like an isotropic and ohmic resis- tor. The white matter, in contrast, showed direc- tional anisotropies, with lower resistance in one and higher resistance in the orthogonal direction. Yet, as for the grey matter, the white matter also behaved like an ohmic resistor. Altogether, our measurements clearly rejected the notion that the cortical tissue behaves like a frequency-­dependent C. Kayser and N. K. Logothetis \n19 filter, at least on the spatial scale relevant to the typical functional imaging applications. As a consequence of this finding, one has to conclude that some of the properties of the field potentials noted above, such as the differ- ent degree of spatial correlations in different frequency bands, are not the result of passive electrical spread in the tissue. In contrast, our findings suggest that the long-range correlations of the low-frequency signals, such as the theta or beta rhythms, result from properties of the gen- erators of these signals, that is, from the spatial patterning of the connections mediating these oscillations, and hence might be a property that is also reflected in the functional imaging signal. 3.4 \u0007The Neural Correlate of the BOLD Signal Given the distinction of the different signals that can be obtained from extracellular recordings, one can ask which signal best explains the activity patterns seen in functional imaging experiments. Or stated otherwise, which signal correlates best with the functional imaging signal? A growing body of work addresses this important question with two complementary approaches. An indirect approach asks whether both methodologies yield similar answers to a typical neuroscientific ques- tion, such as whether a certain region in the brain responds to a given stimulus. A direct approach, on the other hand, measures both signals at the same time to directly correlate the functional imaging activation with the different signals of neuronal activity. A typical example for an indirect comparison was provided by Rees et al. who compared human fMRI measurements with electrophysiologi- cal data from single-unit recordings in monkeys (Rees et al. 2000 ). Both data sets were obtained from the motion-specific areas of the respective species and reflected how much the respective signal changed as a function of the stimulus’ motion coherence. Comparing the slope of both signals, the authors concluded that the BOLD signal was directly proportional to the average firing rate, with a constant of proportionality of approximately nine spikes per second per per- centage BOLD increase.

The left panel displays the schematic representation of the imped- ance measurement. A current of a predefined frequency was injected (via electrodes I+ and I − ), and the voltage difference was measured across electrodes U+ and U − . From this voltage difference, one can infer the cortical resistance ( Z T ) as a function of current frequency, that is, the frequency-dependent impedance spectrum. The field lines indicate the current flow in a homogenous tissue. The right panel displays the measured impedance values for different current strengths in cortex ( solid lines ) and for electronic capacitances. Clearly, the impedance spec- trum of the cortex is nearly flat compared to that of the capacitance, suggesting that the cortex does not behave like a frequency-dependent filter but rather like an ohmic resistor. For details, see Logothetis et al. ( 2007 ) 3  The Electrophysiological Background of the fMRI Signal \n20 but focusing on the signal increase in primary visual cortex as a function of stimulus contrast, Heeger et al. confirmed such a linear relation of spiking activity and the BOLD signal, albeit with a smaller proportionality constant of 0.4 spikes per percentage BOLD increase (Heeger et  al. 2000 ). While these results suggest a good corre- lation of the BOLD signal and firing rates in the same cortical region, they already indicate that the details of this relation, here the constant or proportionality, depend on detailed characteris- tics of each area. While the above studies focused only on fir- ing rates, another study on primary visual cortex extended this approach to a wider range of stim- uli and physiological signals (Kayser et al. 2004 ). Studying the cat visual system, the BOLD signal was obtained from one group of animals, while MUA and field potential responses were recorded in a second group of animals. As a metric of comparison, the authors asked which of the dif- ferent electrophysiological signals would yield similar relative responses to different stimuli as found in the BOLD signal. Stated otherwise, if stimulus A elicits a stronger BOLD response than stimulus B, which of the electrophysiologi- cal signal obeys the same relation across a large fraction of recording sites sampled in the same region of interest from which the BOLD signal is sampled (Fig. 3.3 )? Overall, the MUA provided a worse match to the BOLD signal than did the LFP, although the latter showed strong frequency dependence. The best match between LFP and BOLD was obtained in the frequency range of 20–50  Hz, while slower oscillations generally showed a poor concordance with the imaging data. Noteworthy, this study also showed that the precise results of an indirect comparison can depend strongly on the specific stimuli employed: when the contrast involved grating stimuli, which elicit strong gamma band responses, a good match between the gamma band of the LFP and the BOLD was obtained. However, when the contrast involved only stimuli with less distinct activation patterns in the LFP, the correlation of LFP and BOLD also showed less frequency dependence. While these studies only compared the aver- age response strength of each signal, another extended the comparison to the temporal dimen- sion and correlated the average time course obtained from fMRI with that obtained from neu- ronal responses (Mukamel et al. 2005 ). Using the human auditory cortex as a model system, these authors correlated the average fMRI responses obtained in a group of healthy subjects with intra- cortical recordings obtained from a group of epi- lepsy patients monitored for surgical treatment. While the BOLD signal again correlated well with the LFP, it showed an even stronger corre- lation with neuronal firing rates, contrasting the above result from visual cortex. As these examples demonstrate, the results of an indirect comparison between the BOLD signal and neuronal responses may vary depending on the particular experimental paradigm and stimuli involved. In fact, an indirect comparison can only be conducted after the responses in the two measurements have each been highly averaged over trials. While such averaging will result in a robust estimate of the stimulus-related response, it will also remove the trial to trial variability of neuronal responses, the influence of the mental state and other brain state fluctuations that are not locked to the stimulus used to align the responses. As a result, one compares two “artificial” signals that do not necessarily resemble the pattern of neuronal activity seen during normal brain func- tion. In addition, the temporal resolution of the imaging signal is often quite low, especially in human studies, resulting in a blurred signal which cannot be adequately compared to the fast changes of neuronal activity (see also below). An indirect comparison of functional imaging and neuronal activity can hence only speak about a certain, stimulus-driven aspect of the signals but does not generalize the complex interactions of feedforward and feedback processing that occur during normal conditions, where each activity pattern might be unique and non-repeatable.

The upper panel displays the average BOLD responses to the three kinds of stimuli used in this study, while the middle panel displays the average responses in the LFP and MUA. The lower panel displays the comparison between signals. This was done by counting the fraction of neurophysio- logical recording sites where the activity obeyed the same relations as found in the BOLD signal (noise > natural and gratings > natural). This comparison was performed sepa- rately for each LFP frequency band and MUA. For details, see Kayser et al. ( 2004 ) 3  The Electrophysiological Background of the fMRI Signal \n22 To overcome the limitations of these indirect comparisons, our lab examined the relationship of the BOLD signal to neural activity directly by simultaneously acquiring electrophysiologi- cal and fMRI data from the same animals. To this end, we developed a 4.7 T vertical scanner environment specifically for combined neuro- physiology and imaging experiments, including novel methods for interference compensation, microelectrodes and data denoising (Logothetis et  al. 2001 ). Our measurements showed that the fMRI-­BOLD response directly reflects a local increase in neural activity as assessed by the EFP signal. For the majority of record- ing sites, the BOLD signal was found to be a linear but not time-­invariant function of LFPs, MUA and the firing rate of individual neurons (Fig. 3.4 , upper panel). After stimulus presenta- tion, a transient increase in power was typically observed across all LFP frequencies, followed by a lower level of activation that was main- tained for the entire duration of stimulus pre- sentation. The MUA, in contrast, often showed a more transient response, suggesting a lower cor- relation to the BOLD response. This hypothesis was confirmed using system identification tech- niques: while in general both LFPs and MUA served as good predictors for the BOLD, LFPs on average accounted for 7.6% more of the vari- ance in the fMRI response than the MUA. This difference, albeit small, was statistically signifi- cant across experiments. In further experiments, we confirmed the same findings in alert animals, demonstrating that the correlation of BOLD and LFP holds good also during more complex, nat- ural situations (Goense and Logothetis 2008 ). On the one hand, these findings confirm and extend the previous studies suggesting an anal- Electrode location V1 Electrode 200 4 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0 20 40 60 LFP Frequency [Hz] Serotonin (5-HT 1A ) agonist Control condition MUA γ LFP Stimulus BOLD 80 100 TR = 250 msec TR = 3 sec 120 140 MUA 0 −4 0 200 0 10 20 30 40 Time [s] Stimulus % signal change Correlation Raw ephys signal BOLD Ephys & BOLD signal Correlation of Ephys and BOLD RMS ephys signal Arb. units Fig. 3.4 Simultaneous measurement of BOLD and neu- rophysiological signals in the monkey primary visual cor- tex.

The right panel , finally, displays the temporal cor- relation of both signals, once at high-temporal resolution (TR  =  250 ms) and once using a smoothed, low-­resolution signal (TR =  3 s). The lower row displays a dissociation of BOLD, MUA and LFP induced by the application of a serotonin agonist, which suppresses the firing of pyrami- dal neurons. During drug application, BOLD and LFP responses persist, while the MUA response ceases. For details, see Logothetis et  al. ( 2001 ), Goense and Logothetis ( 2008 ) and Rauch et al. ( 2008 ) C. Kayser and N. K. Logothetis \n23 ogy between spiking responses and the BOLD signal, while on the other hand, they reveal the strong contribution of field potentials to the BOLD signal, thereby suggesting that a direct translation of changes in the BOLD signal into changes in firing rates is misleading. Rather, we suggested on the basis of these observations that the BOLD signal reflects the input to a local region and its local processing, as reflected by the aggregate synaptic activity, more than its output, as reflected in the spiking activity of the principal cells. A recent study in the cat visual cortex con- firmed these findings by combining optical imaging to measure haemodynamic responses with simultaneous microelectrode recordings (Niessing et al. 2005 ). Along the lines of previ- ous results, they found a frequency-dependent match between the imaging signal and LFPs. Especially, frequency bands below 10 Hz showed negative correlations with the imaging signal, that is, reduced field potential during increased blood flow response. Higher frequencies, espe- cially between 50 and 90 Hz, showed good cor- relation with the imaging signal and, importantly, stronger correlations than observed for the MUA. It is worth noting that the exact strength of the correlation between LFP, MUA and BOLD depends on the detailed properties of the para- digm and data acquisition. Especially, the dif- ferent acquisition rates for functional imaging signals and neuronal responses can have pro- found influences, as can easily be demonstrated (Fig. 3.4 , middle panel). Starting from a BOLD signal which was acquired using a temporal reso- lution of 250 ms, we subsequently decimated all signals to an effective temporal resolution of 3 s, the typical temporal resolution of human imaging studies. While the “fast” BOLD signal exhibits the well-established differential correlation of LFP and MUA with the BOLD, the “slow” signal shows an overall stronger correlation and less of a difference between LFP and MUA. Decreasing the temporal resolution effectively smoothens a signal and increases the coherence between LFP frequency bands hence the increased correla- tion. Not surprisingly, the correlation coefficients did not increase uniformly across frequency bands; the filtering particularly affected the high-­ frequency bands (>60  Hz), which are typically modulated on faster timescales. As a result, the smoothing unavoidably increases the correla- tion of MUA to the BOLD response as well. Such simple differences of the temporal resolu- tion of the acquired signals can explain the dif- ferent degree of correlations found in ours and in indirect human studies, since the latter heav- ily relied on temporally smoothed signals and ­subject-­averaged signals (Mukamel et al. 2005 ). To conclude, care must be taken when interpret- ing correlations of haemodynamic and neuronal signals, as apparent conflicts can simply arise from methodological artefacts rather than true differences. 3.5 \u0007The Coupling of Synaptic Activity and CBF A reason for the more gradual differences between LFP and MUA in their relation to the BOLD sig- nal is that under many conditions, MUA and LFPs will vary together. In other words, in many stim- ulation conditions, the output of any processing station in subcortical and early cortical structures is likely to reflect the changes of the input, and the LFP-MUA relationship will be “tight,” and both will be well correlated with BOLD. Yet, this scenario might be an “exception” when generat- ing cognitive maps during complex tasks; as in such cases, the subject’s “mental” state might be instantiated in diverse feedforward and feedback processes that do not necessarily increase the net output of cortical microcircuits. Hence, condi- tions might exist during which there is a disso- ciation of these signals, for example, a condition in which an increase in local input (LFP) results in a reduction in  local output activity (MUA). Clearly, such situations could reveal important insights into the different processes underlying the different signals and their mutual relations. A powerful example of such a dissociation was pro- vided by Mathiesen et al. ( 1998 , 2000 ), Thomsen et al. ( 2004 ). These authors nicely exploited the synaptic organization of the cerebellar cortex, where electrical stimulation of the parallel fibres 3  The Electrophysiological Background of the fMRI Signal \n24 causes monosynaptic excitation of the Purkinje cells and disynaptic inhibition of the same neu- rons through the basket cells. This results in inhi- bition of the spiking activity in the Purkinje cells while at the same time increasing the synaptic input to these cells. Combining electrophysi- ological recordings with laser Doppler flowme- try to measure changes in CBF, Mathiesen et al. demonstrated a powerful dissociation of the spik- ing activity and the CBF. Both LFPs and CBF increased while spiking activity ceased, clearly demonstrating that increases in CBF or BOLD do not allow to make inferences about potential increases or decreases in the spiking activity of the stimulated region (Lauritzen and Gold 2003 ). A similar dissociation of the imaging signal and neuronal firing rates could be seen in our studies (Logothetis et  al. 2001 ). Often, the sin- gle- or multiunit activity showed strong response adaptation during the first few seconds, with a subsequent decay of the firing rates to baseline. In contrast to this, the BOLD signal and the LFP did persist above baseline throughout the stimulation period. As a result, during the sustained period of the stimulus, only the field potential can be asso- ciated with the imaging signal, but not the spiking activity. Importantly, there was no condition or observation period during which the opposite was observed. In addition to this naturally occurring dissociation, similar situations can be induced pharmacologically. For example, the application of a serotonin receptor agonist, which causes per- sistent hyperpolarization of pyramidal neurons, leads to a ceasing of the MUA responses (Fig. 3.4 , lower panel). However, at the very same time, both the LFP and the BOLD signal still respond to visual stimulation, again demonstrating that the BOLD signal is not necessarily coupled to neuro- nal spiking responses (see Rauch et al. ( 2008 ) for further results along this line). Is the CBF signal then linearly coupled to synaptic activity? While this indeed seems to hold good under some conditions, other con- ditions produce a nonlinear relation between afferent input and the haemodynamic response (Mathiesen et  al. 1998 ; Norup Nielsen and Lauritzen 2001 ). Especially for very low or high levels of synaptic input, the CBF response can be decoupled from the input. For example, inducing deactivation of neuronal responses by either functional deactivation or application of TTX resulted in only a small reduction in base- line CBF (Gold and Lauritzen 2002 ). During such instances of neurovascular decoupling, the imaging data does not reflect all the changes in synaptic afferents, clearly highlighting the lim- ited dynamic range of functional imaging. Such nonlinear relation between synaptic activity and CBF might, for example, arise from the unequal contribution of different receptors and channels to synaptic potentials and blood flow. For exam- ple, glutamatergic NMDA channels contribute to CBF but only little to the LFP (Hoffmeyer et al. 2007 ). As a result, blood flow responses might also exist in the absence of large changes in the LFP, providing strong evidence that it is not the extracellular current that causes increase in CBF but the intracellular signalling cascades related to neurotransmitter release, uptake and recycling. Indeed, while the haemodynamic response pro- vides supplies of glucose and oxygen, it is not the processes that require the energy that call for an increase in CBF but rather the processes triggered in a feedforward manner by neurotransmitter-­ related signalling (Lauritzen 2005 ). The notion that functional imaging measures the aggregate synaptic input to a local area also resolves a number of apparently conflicting results from imaging and electrophysiologi- cal experiments. Being sensitive to the synaptic input, functional imaging “sees” modulatory lat- eral and feedback projections, which might not be strong enough to induce significant changes in neuronal firing rates but nevertheless provides a larger proportion of the total synaptic input. For example, human imaging revealed influences of spatial attention in many visual areas, including primary visual cortex. At the same time, such attentional influences have been persistently difficult to demonstrate using single-neuron recordings or turned out to be much weaker than expected from human imaging (Luck et al. 1997 ; Kastner and Ungerleider 2000 ; Heeger and Ress 2002 ). Given that attentional influences are sup- posedly mediated by feedback projections from higher visual and frontoparietal regions, they C. Kayser and N. K. Logothetis \n25 might provide exactly this kind of input that is visible only using functional imaging. Along the same lines, it has been much easier to see cross-­ modal interactions, that is, influences of one sensory modality on another, using functional imaging than using electrophysiology (Calvert 2001 ; Kayser and Logothetis 2007 ). For exam- ple, functional imaging demonstrated that audi- tory cortex can be modulated and even activated by visual or somatosensory stimuli (Kayser et al. 2007b ), while the same effects are only weakly present at the level of single-neuron firing rates. However, in full agreement with the above, visual modulation was well evident at the level of field potentials recorded in auditory cortex, again demonstrating a closer correspondence of the BOLD signal with field potentials than with fir- ing rates (Kayser et al. 2008 ). 3.6 \u0007Conclusions The haemodynamic responses characterized by functional imaging better reflect the aggregate synaptic activity and local processing that is characterized by the LFPs rather than providing information about the typical firing rates in the same region. This partly results from the mecha- nisms that drive increases in blood flow, which reside upstream from the axosomatic level and near the synaptic-dendritic level. The collective findings of many studies pro- vide good evidence for the notion that functional imaging reflects the input into a local region but not necessarily the output of the same. Under many normal conditions, the input and output of a local region will be related, and hence func- tional imaging will provide information about the typical neuronal firing rates in the same region. As a result of this sensitivity to synaptic input, functional imaging signals are more susceptible to modulatory feedback input, which often might provide only a minor contribution to the response strength of large principal neurons. However, for a priori and most experimental conditions, it is unclear what relationship to expect between in- and output, and hence feedforward- and feedback-­related activations cannot be distin- guished. As a result, it can sometimes be mislead- ing, if not dangerous, to make direct inferences from imaging results about the underlying neu- ronal processes. Especially for applications with immediate consequences, such as clinical diag- nostics and surgical planning, it seems prudent to establish well-defined paradigms in which the neural correlates of the imaging signal have been validated using combined electrophysiological and imaging approaches."
