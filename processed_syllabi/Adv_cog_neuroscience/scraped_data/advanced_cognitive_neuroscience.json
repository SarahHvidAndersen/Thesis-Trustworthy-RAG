The focus of the course is on advanced experimental methods in cognitive neuroscience, and students will conduct their own cognitive neuroimaging/cognitive neurophysiology research. Students will learn advanced statistical methods for analysing data acquired from the measurement of neural processes, with a focus on modelling techniques for relating neural data to cognitive functions.\nThe course includes 1) theory of neural and cognitive processes; 2) advanced statistical methodologies for analysing neuroimaging data; and 3) discussion of the theoretical relationships between neurobiological and cognitive brain processes.\nThis course builds on students’ knowledge of cognition, and their skills and competencies in using statistical methods.\nAcademic objectives:\nIn the evaluation of the student’s performance, emphasis is placed on the extent to which the student is able to:\nKnowledge:\n- describe the anatomy and physiology of the human brain, and explain the brain basis of cognitive function\n- contrast different cognitive neuroscience methods in terms of their strengths and weaknesses, and use this knowledge to develop appropriate experimental research for investigating different cognitive functions of the brain.\nSkills:\n- run experiments using neuroimaging and/or neurophysiological measurement equipment\n- use advanced statistical methods to make inferences about cognitive brain functions from neuroimaging and/or neurophysiological data.\nCompetences:\n- independently identify the appropriate measurement technology and experimental designs for investigating different cognitive functions\n- identify cases in which statistical methods taught in the course can be applied to domains outside of cognitive neuroscience.\nSee all\nECTS\n10\nLevel\nMaster\nSemester\nMA, 1st semester\nLanguage of instruction\nEnglish\nHours - week - period\nTime and place will be announced no later than at the start of the semester here:\nhttps://timetable.au.dk/schedule\nType of course\nOrdinary\nPrimary programme\nMaster's Degree Programme in Cognitive Science\nDepartment\nSchool of Communication and Culture\nFaculty\nArts\nLocation\nAarhus\nSTADS UVA code\n147222U003\nCopy UVA code\nTeaching\nForms of instruction\nLecture and classroom instruction\nInstructors\nSee all\nIda Anthonj Nissen\nInstitut for Kommunikation og Kultur - Kognitionsvidenskab\nMikkel Wallentin\nInstitut for Kommunikation og Kultur - Kognitionsvidenskab\nKristoffer Laigaard Nielbo\nInstitut for Kultur og Samfund - Center for Humanities Computing\nAndreas Højlund\nInstitut for Kommunikation og Kultur - Kognitionsvidenskab\nComments on the form of instruction\nRead more\nThe course combines lectures with practical exercises and workshops.\nStudents produce a number of assignments during the course. At the start of the semester, the teacher will inform the students of the number of assignments, their form, length and deadlines both on Brightspace and orally. The assignments can provide the basis for various forms of feedback and further development related to the teaching, but the individual assignments are not assessed on a continuous basis. All or some of these assignments can provide the basis for the student’s exam.\nLanguage of instruction:\nThe rules governing language of exam and teaching are stated in section 2.1 of the academic regulations.\nLiterature\nRead more\nWill be announced on Brightspace at the start of the semester.\nExamination\nForm of examination\nTake-home assignment (Assign)\nForm of co-examination\nInternal co-examination\nAssessment\n7-point grading scale\nPermitted exam aids\nNot specified\nComments\nRead more\nOrdinary exam and re-examination:\nThe exam consists of a portfolio containing 3-7 of assignments. The number of assignments as well as their form and eventual length will be announced on Brightspace by the teacher at the start of the semester. The portfolio may include products. Depending on their length, and subject to the teacher’s approval, these products can replace some of the standard pages in the portfolio.\nIt must be possible to carry out an individual assessment. So if some parts of the portfolio have been produced by a group, it must be stated clearly which parts each student is responsible for, and which parts the group as a whole is responsible for.\nThe complete portfolio must be submitted for assessment in WISEflow before the deadline set in the examination plan. Each student submits a portfolio.",
