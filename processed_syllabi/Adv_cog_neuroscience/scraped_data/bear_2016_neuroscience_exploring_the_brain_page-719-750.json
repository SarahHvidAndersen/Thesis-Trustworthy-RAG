As you take a sip of a cold drink, you stare out at the sky day- dreaming. This peaceful moment is suddenly interrupted when your at- tention is grabbed by the dorsal ﬁ n of a shark sticking out of the water and moving toward you. You jump up and are about to run when you become aware of the fact that the “shark” is actually a child wearing a fake ﬁ n. This imaginary scene includes three mental functions we will examine in this chapter. The ﬁ rst is the brain at rest. You might logically think the brain activity of a person daydreaming at the beach would be about as interesting as looking at a blank piece of paper. On the contrary, recent research indicates that in the brain “at rest” a network of areas is busy doing things such as diffusely monitoring our surroundings and process- ing daydreams. When we become more active, the brain must deal with the enormous volume of information coming in through our senses. Rather than try- ing to process all of these signals simultaneously, we selectively focus on things that catch our attention, such as a shark ﬁ n in the water or an object important to us, like a cold drink about to ﬂ y out of our hand. Selective attention, or simply attention , is the ability to focus on one aspect of sensory input. In the visual system, attention enables us to con- centrate on one object over many others in our visual ﬁ eld. Interactions between modalities also occur. For example, if you are performing an attention-demanding visual task, such as reading a book at a coffee shop, you will be less sensitive to the sounds of people talking around you. Amidst all the sights, sounds, and tastes coming into our brain, we are able to preferentially process some information and ignore the rest. We will see that attention has signiﬁ cant effects on perception and that there are corresponding changes in the sensitivity of neurons at many locations in the brain. A brain function related to attention is consciousness. In general use, consciousness means awareness of something (the fake shark ﬁ n in our example). For centuries, philosophers have wrestled with the meaning of consciousness, and more recently, neuroscientists have devised experi- ments to reveal the neural basis of the conscious brain. The link between attention and consciousness appears to be tight, as we are generally aware of what we pay attention to. However, we will see they are actually distinctly different processes. RESTING STATE BRAIN ACTIVITY If you go into a quiet room, lie down, and close your eyes (but stay awake), what do you suppose your brain is doing? If your answer is “not much,” you are probably in good company. In our discussions of various brain systems, we have described how neurons become active in response to incoming sensory information or the generation of movement. Modern brain imaging techniques are consistent with this view that, in response to behavioral demands, neurons become more active in cortical areas that process ongoing perceptual or motor information. It is reasonable to infer that the brain is quiet in the absence of active processing. However, when the entire brain is imaged with positron emission tomography (PET) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), it is found that its resting state activity includes some  regions that really are fairly quiet I NT R O D U C TIO N R E S T I N G S T A TE B RA IN A C TIV IT Y \n721 CHAPTER 21 THE RESTING BRAIN, ATTENTION, AND CONSCIOUSNESS and others that are surprisingly active. An important question is what, if anything, does the resting activity signify? The Brain’s Default Mode Network Human imaging studies suggest that the difference between the brain’s resting state and the activity recorded while a person performs a task may teach us important lessons about the nature of the resting brain and the functions that it performs. The existence of resting state activity does not in itself allow us to conclude much. Conceivably, the resting activ- ity might vary randomly from moment to moment and person to person, and activations associated with behavioral tasks would be superimposed on this random background. However, this does not seem to be the case. When a person engages in a perceptual or behavioral task, there are de- creases in the activity of some brain areas at the same time that task- relevant brain areas become more active. One possibility is that both the decreases and increases in activity are related to the task. For example, if a person is required to perform a difﬁ cult visual task and ignore irrel- evant sounds, we might expect the visual cortex to become more active and the auditory cortex less active. Two further observations suggest that there is something fundamen- tal and signiﬁ cant about the resting brain activity. First, the areas that show decreased activity compared to the resting state are consistent when the nature of the task is changed. It appears that the areas show- ing decreased activity during behavioral tasks are always active at rest and become less active during any task. Figure 21.1 summarizes data from experiments using nine different tasks involving vision, language, and memory. The blue and green patches in the ﬁ gure show brain areas in which activity decreased from the resting state when humans en- gaged in any of the nine tasks. The particular task does not seem to account for the activity changes. Second, the patterns in brain activ- ity changes are consistent across human subjects. These observations suggest that the brain might be “busy” even in the state we call rest, that the resting activities are consistent, and that these activities are decreased when a task is performed. FIGURE 21.1 The default mode network. (a) Data from nine PET imaging studies involving different behavioral tasks were averaged to produce these lateral and medial views of brain activity. The brains have been computer “inflated” so activity in the sulci can be seen. Brain areas col- ored blue and green were more active during quiet rest periods than during the behavioral tasks. (b) Slow fluctuations in brain activity are correlated between the medial prefrontal cortex and the cingu- late cortex (arrows in a). These fMRI recordings were made while a person quietly fixated on a small cross on a visual display. (Source: Raichle et al., 2007, Fig. 1.) (a) (b) \n722 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR Brain areas that show more activity in the resting state than during behavioral tasks include the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, posterior parietal cortex, hippocampus, and lateral temporal cor- tex. Together these areas are called the default mode network ,  or de- fault network, to indicate that the brain defaults to activity in this group of interconnected areas when it is not engaged in an overt task. Some scientists believe this network of areas deﬁ nes a system or a group of interacting systems in the same sense as we deﬁ ne sensory and motor systems. A ﬁ nding consistent with this idea is the striking degree of corre- lation in brain activity between components of the default mode network. Figure 21.1b shows a 5-minute recording made from the two brain areas (medial prefrontal, cingulate cortex) indicated by arrows in Figure 21.1a. The subject was lying in an fMRI machine doing nothing more than ﬁ xat- ing on a small crosshair on a visual display. For reasons unknown, there were continuous variations in the fMRI signal and there was a remark- able degree of correlation between activity in the distant brain areas. Whether these ﬂ uctuations are related to thought is not known, but they suggest coordination or interaction between brain areas. Establishing the function of the default mode network is challenging because the brain areas involved participate in diverse activities. It is tempting to view the resting state activity as an indication of the inner life of the brain. When we relax, it is common to daydream, remember, and imagine, things referred to as spontaneous cognition . As the default mode network is deactivated during most tasks, it is difﬁ cult to conduct experiments examining its function. However, we can infer possible func- tions of the default network by considering its components and the hand- ful of tasks that do activate it. For starters, the absence of primary sen- sory and motor areas is consistent with the idea that the default network is not chieﬂ y concerned with taking in sensory information or controlling movement. Functions of the Default Network. A variety of hypotheses have been considered for the function of the default network. The two we will con- sider here are the sentinel hypothesis and the internal mentation hypoth- esis . The idea behind the sentinel hypothesis is that even when we rest, we must broadly monitor (pay attention to) our environment; in compari- son, when we are active, we focus our attention on the matter at hand. If you imagine our ancient ancestors living in a world harboring constant threats, it makes sense that we may have evolved to be always “on the lookout.” One experiment with results consistent with this idea found that decreases from default network activity are less when a person switches from rest to a peripheral vision task than from rest to a foveal vision task. Perhaps the decrease is less when the active task involves periph- eral vision because at rest we always diffusely monitor our broad visual ﬁ eld (thus, there is less change from this sentinel activity to an active task involving peripheral vision). Another study reported that the default network became activated in an experiment requiring people to broadly monitor their peripheral visual ﬁ eld for stimuli at random locations but not when they were instructed to focus on one location where a stimulus might appear. Also relevant to the sentinel hypothesis is a rare disorder known as simultagnosia (a component of Bálint’s syndrome), in which people have normal visual ﬁ elds and are able to perceive individual ob- jects, but are unable to integrate simultaneous information to understand a complex scene. For example, shown a picture of an animal, a patient said, “There is a round head joining what looks like a powerful body; there are four shortish legs; it doesn’t say anything to me; ah, but there is a \n723 CHAPTER 21 THE RESTING BRAIN, ATTENTION, AND CONSCIOUSNESS small and curly tail so I think it must be a pig.” In other words, this per- son was not able to put the pieces mentally together and recognized the pig only because of its distinctive tail. Evidence suggests that the pos- terior cingulate cortex, a part of the default network, may play a role in diffusely monitoring the visual ﬁ eld for stimuli. The speculation is that this brain area, which is part of the default network and is damaged in simultagnosia, is involved in sentinel activities. The internal mentation hypothesis says that the default mode network supports thinking and remembering, the sort of daydreaming we do while sitting quietly. In an experiment that suggests this hypothesis, brain activity is imaged while subjects are asked to silently recall past events in their lives or imagine an event that might happen to them in the future. For example, “recall a past event from last week” or “envisage a future event in the next 5–20 years.” Brain activity in these autobiographical memory tasks is contrasted with activity recorded in control tasks that involve the simple use of facts rather than recall and thinking about au- tobiographical information. In one control task, subjects construct a sen- tence using a cue word, and in another, they imagine objects bigger and smaller than an object named by a cue word. In the memory tasks, the hippocampus and neocortical areas in the default network become more active; in the control tasks, these brain areas were not activated. The hy- pothesis is that the memory tasks activate the brain in a manner similar to daydreaming about one’s life, unlike the structured use of facts in the control tasks. Figure 21.2 shows that recalling past events and imagin- ing new ones activate similar regions of medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex. Although not all scientists agree with the deﬁ nition of a default mode network, considerable evidence suggests that certain components of the brain are busier while we rest and that they do different things from brain areas that become engaged during active tasks. The overall hypothesis is that, when the situation requires us to become actively involved in a per- ceptual or motor task, we switch modes from sentinel and internal men- tation activities (high default network activity) to focused processing of sensory input (low default network activity and increased sensory–motor activity). Studying functions of the resting brain is challenging because typical experimental tasks (“do this,” “look at that”) shut down the areas being studied. One thing that seems clear is that the transition from brain activity in the default network at rest to sensory processing in active tasks involves a change in the focus of attention—our next topic to explore. ATTENTION Picture yourself at a crowded party surrounded by loud music and the chatter of hundreds of people. Even though you are bombarded by sound from all directions, you are somehow able to concentrate on the A T T E N T I O N FIGURE 21.2 Activation of the default mode network. In the main experimental conditions, subjects were asked to recall a past event or imagine an event in the future after seeing a cue word (e.g., dress). In con- trol tasks, subjects either generated a sentence or named objects in response to a cue. Recordings with fMRI show that similar pos- terior cingulate and medial prefrontal components of the default network were activated in the autobiographical memory tasks more than in the control tasks. (Source: Addis et al., 2007, Fig. 2.) \n724 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR conversation you’re having and ignore most of the other noise and talk- ing. You are paying attention to the one conversation. Behind you, you hear someone mention your name, and you decide to eavesdrop. Without turning around, you start focusing your attention on this other conver- sation to ﬁ nd out what’s being said about you. This common experience of ﬁ ltering auditory input, called the cocktail party effect ,  is an example of attention that we use within and across sensory modalities. Because its behavioral and neural functions have been studied in detail, we will focus on visual attention. Studies of attention often describe it as a limited resource or bottleneck in brain processing. It is common to use the term “selective attention” to emphasize that it is directed to select objects, unlike overall arousal, which is unselective. For brevity, we will use “attention,” but this term should be taken to mean selective attention. The limit that attention puts on brain processing is probably a good thing; one can only imagine how overwhelming sensory input might be if we were to simultaneously focus on every portion of our visual environment, every sound, and every smell. The limited capacity of attention probably explains why trafﬁ c accidents are much more common while people are texting or talking on cell phones. As we will see, attention has signiﬁ cant effects on behavioral speed and precision. While it is not simply a problem of attention, attention-deﬁ cit hyperactivity disorder demonstrates how critical attentional mechanisms are (Box 21.1). O F  S P E C I A L  I N T E R E S T BOX 21.1 Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder I t is the last lecture of the school year, and you are failing miserably at focusing on the instructor as you stare long- ingly at the green grass and trees outside the window. At times, we all have difﬁ culty concentrating on our work, sitting still, and resisting the urge to play. But for millions of people, the syndrome that has come to be called attention-deﬁ cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) routinely and seriously inter- feres with their ability to get things done. The three traits commonly associated with ADHD are inat- tention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness. Children normally exhibit these traits more than adults, but if their behaviors are pronounced, ADHD may be diagnosed. Estimates are that 5–10% of all school-age children worldwide have ADHD, and the disorder interferes with their schoolwork and interactions with classmates. Follow-up studies show that many people diagnosed with ADHD continue to exhibit some symptoms as adults. We do not know what causes ADHD, but there are several clues. For example, it has been reported that in MRI scans, several brain structures, including prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia, are smaller in children with ADHD. It is not known whether these differences are behaviorally signiﬁ cant, and they are not reliable enough to be a basis for diagnos- ing the disorder. However, the possible involvement of these structures is intriguing because they have long been impli- cated in the regulation and planning of behavior. You might recall Phineas Gage from Box 18.2  in Chapter 18, who ex- perienced great difﬁ culty making and carrying out plans after a severe lesion to his prefrontal cortex. Several pieces of evidence suggest that heredity plays a signiﬁ cant role in ADHD. Children of parents with ADHD are more likely to develop it, and a child is much more likely to have it if an identical twin does. Nongenetic factors, such as brain injury and premature birth, may also be involved. Several genes related to the function of dopaminergic neurons have been reported to be abnormal in people with ADHD. These include the D4 dopamine receptor gene, the D2 dopamine receptor gene, and the dopamine transporter gene. We have seen in several previous chapters how important dopaminer- gic transmission is for a variety of behaviors, so it will be a challenge to clarify dopamine’s involvement in ADHD. At present the most common treatment for ADHD, aside from behavioral therapy, is psychostimulant drugs such as Ritalin. Ritalin is a mild central nervous system stimulant simi- lar to amphetamines. It also inhibits the dopamine transporter, increasing the postsynaptic effect of dopamine. In many chil- dren, Ritalin successfully decreases impulsiveness and inat- tention, although questions about long-term use remain. \n725 CHAPTER 21 THE RESTING BRAIN, ATTENTION, AND CONSCIOUSNESS Daily life suggests that attention is directed in two different ways. Suppose you are walking through a ﬁ eld of grass where amidst the sea of green grows a single bright-yellow dandelion. Your attention may be automatically drawn to the dandelion because the color “pops out” from the background. We say the dandelion “caught our attention.” Certain visual features, such as a distinctive color, movement, or a ﬂ ashing light, draw our attention automatically (Figure 21.3). This is called exogenous attention or bottom–up attention because the stimulus attracts our attention without any cognitive input. Presumably a process like this is used by many animals to rapidly detect and evade predators. Quite dif- ferent is top–down attention , also called endogenous attention , in which attention is deliberately directed by the brain to some object or place to serve a behavioral goal. You might be ﬂ ipping through this book looking for a passage that you know is in the upper-right corner of a page. The search is made easier by the allocation of attention speciﬁ cally to the page corner. Behavioral Consequences of Attention In most situations, if we want to visually scrutinize something, we move our eyes so that the object of interest is imaged on the fovea in each eye. Implicit in this behavior is the fact that most of the time we pay attention to the object we are looking at. However, it is also possible to shift attention to objects imaged on parts of the retina outside the fovea; this phenom- enon of “looking out of the corner of one’s eyes” is called covert attention because our gaze doesn’t reveal what we are attending to. Whether on the fovea or a more peripheral portion of the retina, focusing attention en- hances visual processing at that location in several ways. Two ways we’ll look at are enhanced visual sensitivity and faster reaction times. Attention Enhances Visual Sensitivity. Figure 21.4 shows an experiment for studying the effects of directing visual attention to different locations. The observer ﬁ xated on a central point, and her task was to say whether a target stimulus was ﬂ ashed on at a location to the left of the ﬁ xation point, to the right, or not at all. The task was difﬁ cult because the target was small and ﬂ ashed on very brieﬂ y. The experiment included several special procedures for identifying the effects of attention. Each trial began with the presentation of a cue stimulus at the ﬁ xation point. The cue was either a plus sign, an arrow pointing left, or an arrow pointing right. After the cue was extinguished, a variable delay period followed, during which FIGURE 21.3 Visual “pop out.” A salient difference in color automatically draws your attention.

In half the trials, there was no further stimulus, and in the other half, a small target circle was ﬂ ashed on for 15 msec at either the left or right position. A key element of the experiment is that the cue was used to direct attention. If the central cue was a plus sign, it was equally likely that a little circle would appear to either the left or the right. The plus sign was thus a “neutral cue.” If the cue was a left arrow, it was four times more likely that the target would appear on the left than on the right. If the cue was a right arrow, it was four times more likely that the target would appear on the right than on the left. If the target appeared to the Attended location Fixation point Cue Attention shifts to right Target appears at cued location Target appears at uncued location ▲ FIGURE 21.4 An experiment to measure the effect of attention on visual detection. While an observer maintains steady fixation, a cue directs her to shift her attention to one side of the computer screen. In each trial, the observer indicates whether a circular target is seen on either side of the screen. \n727 CHAPTER 21 THE RESTING BRAIN, ATTENTION, AND CONSCIOUSNESS cued side, the cue was “valid”; the cue was “invalid” if it pointed away from where the target would appear. The observer was required to keep her eyes pointing straight ahead, but in order to make the most correct responses on the difﬁ cult task of detecting the ﬂ ashed circle targets, it would be advantageous to make use of the cue. For instance, if the cue was a right arrow, it would be beneﬁ cial to try to covertly attend to the right target location more than the left. For each of the subjects used in this experiment, the data collected consisted of the percentage of the time a circle was correctly detected. Because there was no target circle in half the trials, the observers could not get a high percentage correct by “cheating” (i.e., by saying there was always a target at the side where the arrow pointed). In trials where the central cue was a plus sign, the observers detected the target stimulus in about 60% of the trials in which one was presented. When the cue was a right arrow, the observers detected the target stimulus to the right on about 80% of the trials in which one was presented there. However, when the cue pointed right, the observers detected the target stimulus to the left in only about 50% of the trials in which one was presented there. With the appropriate left–right reversal, the results were about the same with left arrows. The results are summarized in Figure 21.5. What do these data mean? To answer, we must imagine what the observer was doing. Evidently, the expectation of the observer based on the cues inﬂ uenced her ability to detect the subsequent targets. It ap- pears that the arrow cues caused the observer to shift her attention to the side where the arrow pointed, even though her eyes didn’t move. Presumably, this covert shift of attention made it easier to detect the ﬂ ashed targets compared to the trials when the central cue was a plus sign. Conversely, the observer was less sensitive to the targets on the side of ﬁ xation opposite to where the arrow cue pointed. Based on these results and those from many other similar experiments, our ﬁ rst con- clusion about the behavioral effects of attention is that it increases our visual sensitivity, making things easier to detect. This is probably one of the reasons we can listen in on one conversation among many when we give it our attention. Attention Speeds Reaction Times. Using an experimental technique similar to the one discussed earlier, it has been demonstrated that atten- tion increases the speed of our reactions to sensory events. In a typical experiment, an observer ﬁ xated on a central point on a computer screen, and target stimuli were presented to either the left or the right of the ﬁ xation point. However, in this experiment, the observer was told to wait until he perceived a stimulus at either location and to press a button when he did. A measurement was made of how long it took the observer to react to the presentation of a stimulus and press a button. Preceding the target was a cue stimulus, either a plus sign or an arrow pointing left or right. The arrows indicated the side to which a stimulus was more likely to appear, whereas the plus sign meant that either side was equally likely. Results from this experiment demonstrated that an observer’s reaction times were inﬂ uenced by where the central cue told him to direct his at- tention. When the central cue was a plus sign, it took about 250–300 msec to press the button. When an arrow cue correctly indicated where a target would appear (e.g., right arrow and right target), reaction times were 20–30 msec faster. Conversely, when the arrow cue pointed in one direc- tion and the target appeared at the opposite location, it took 20–30 msec longer to react to the target and press the button. The reaction time in- cluded time for transduction in the visual system, time for visual process- 50 0 100 Target detection (%) Invalid Neutral Cue Valid ▲ FIGURE 21.5 The effect of cueing on target detec- tion. Detection of a visual target is im- proved if the location of the upcoming target is validly cued. Performance with an invalid cue is worse than with a neu- tral cue that gives no indication of where the target will appear. \n728 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR ing, time to make a decision, time to code for the ﬁ nger movement, and time to press the button. Nonetheless, there was a small but reliable ef- fect based on which direction the arrows directed the observer’s attention (Figure 21.6). If we assume that attention to visual objects does not have a direct effect on visual transduction or motor coding, we are left with the hypothesis that attention can alter the speed of visual processing, or the time to make a decision about pressing the button. An example from daily experience underscores the behavioral implications of a reac- tion time delay due to attention: If you are driving a car at 60 mph and attending to something other than the road, a 30 msec delay translates into applying the car brakes about 25 feet further down the road, perhaps too late to avoid hitting a car or person. Physiological Effects of Attention What is happening in the brain when we shift our attention to some- thing? For example, in the behavioral studies just discussed, is a subject’s performance enhanced because neural activity in a particular brain area is somehow “better”? While it’s conceivable that attention is strictly a high-level cognitive process, experiments demonstrate that the effects of attention can be observed in numerous sensory areas stretching from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to visual cortical areas in the parietal and temporal lobes. We will look at human brain imaging studies that show activity changes associated with the allocation of attention and then turn to animal studies that reveal the effects of attention on individual neurons. These experiments show the consequences of allocating atten- tion to a location or feature. Functional MRI Imaging of Human Attention to Location. A key obser- vation made in behavioral studies of visual attention is that enhance- ments in detection and reaction time are selective for spatial location. When we know where an important stimulus is more likely to appear, we move our attention to it and process the sensory information with greater sensitivity and speed. A common analogy is that there is a spotlight of attention that moves to illuminate objects of particular interest or sig- niﬁ cance. Experiments using fMRI imaging of the human brain suggest that there may be selective changes in brain activity associated with spa- tial shifts in attention. In one experiment, subjects in the fMRI machine viewed a stimulus consisting of patches of colored lines arranged in 24 sectors as shown at the bottom of Figure 21.7a. The upper panels in Figure 21.7a show a sequence of four sectors, moving out from the ﬁ xation point, that a sub- ject was cued to attend to. The location of the cued sector changed every 10 seconds. During the 10-second period, the color and orientation of the line segments in all of the sectors changed every 2 seconds. Each time the line segments changed, the subject’s task was to press one button if the lines were blue and horizontal or orange and vertical, and a second button if the lines were blue and vertical or orange and horizontal. The reason for having the subjects perform this task was to force them to at- tend to a particular sector of the stimulus and ignore the rest. Remember that subjects always kept their gaze ﬁ xed at the center of the bull’s-eye stimulus. The fascinating aspect of this experiment involves what happens when the location of the sector being attended to changes. Figure 21.7b shows brain activity recorded with the attended sector at four locations at in- creasing distance from the ﬁ xation point. Notice how the areas of en- hanced brain activity (red and yellow) move away from the occipital pole 250 200 300 Reaction time (msec) Invalid Neutral Cue Valid ▲ FIGURE 21.6 The effect of cueing on reaction time. In neutral cue trials, the cue was a plus sign, which gave no indication of the likely location of the following target. In valid cue trials, the arrow cue pointed to the location where the target later ap- peared, speeding reactions to the tar- gets. When the cue was invalid, pointing in a direction opposite to where the tar- get later appeared, reaction times were slower.

(a) The stimulus (bottom) consisted of patches of vertical and horizontal blue and orange lines ar- ranged into 24 sectors radiating out from the central fixation point.

From top to bottom, the upper four bull’s-eye patterns indicate in red a sequence of four sectors that a subject was cued to attend to. (b) Superimposed on a schematic image of the brain, red and yellow areas show loca- tions of enhanced brain activity associated with attention to the sector to the left in (a). As attention was directed from cen- tral to more peripheral vision, cortical enhancement moved away from the pole of the occipital lobe (Source: Courtesy of J. A. Brefczynski and E. A. DeYoe.) as the attended sector moves out from the fovea. The pattern of brain ac- tivity shifts retinotopically, even though the visual stimuli are the same regardless of which sector is attended. The hypothesis is that these im- ages show the neural effect of the spotlight of attention moving to differ- ent locations. PET Imaging of Human Attention to Features. The fMRI results dis- cussed above appear consistent with the behavioral observation that vi- sual attention can be moved independently of eye position. But attention \n730 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR involves more than just location. Imagine walking down a crowded city sidewalk in the winter looking for someone. Everyone is bundled in heavy coats, but you know your friend will be wearing a red hat. By mentally “focusing” on red, it will be much easier to pick out your friend. Evidently, we are able to pay particular attention to visual features such as color to enhance our performance. Is there any reﬂ ection of this attention to features in brain activity? The answer has come from studies using PET imaging in humans. Steven Petersen and his colleagues at Washington University used PET imaging while humans performed a same–different discrimination task (Figure 21.8). An image was ﬂ ashed on a computer screen for about half a second; after a delay period, another image was ﬂ ashed. Each image was composed of small elements that could vary in shape, color, and speed of motion. The task of the observer was to indicate whether the two successive images were the same or different. To isolate the effect of attention, two different versions of the experiment were conducted. In selective-attention experiments, subjects were instructed to pay atten- tion to just one of the features (shape, color, or speed) and they indicated whether that feature was the same or different in the two images. In divided-attention experiments, subjects simultaneously monitored all features and based their same–different judgments on changes in any feature. The researchers then subtracted the divided-attention responses from the selective-attention responses to obtain an image of changes in brain activity associated with attention to one feature. Figure 21.9 illustrates the results. Different areas of cortex had higher activity when different attributes of the stimuli were being  discriminated. For instance, whereas ventromedial occipital cortex was affected by at- tention in color (blue spots) and shape (orange spots) discrimination tasks, it was not affected in the speed discrimination task (green spots). Conversely, areas in parietal cortex were inﬂ uenced by attention to the Image 1 Image 2 ▲ FIGURE 21.8 Same–different stimuli used for PET imaging. The observer sees image 1 fol- lowed by image 2.

While it is not possible to know with certainty which cortical areas were highlighted in these experiments, areas of heightened activity in the color and shape tasks may have corre- sponded to areas V4 and IT and other visual cortical areas in the tempo- ral lobe. The area most affected by performing the motion task was near area MT. These effects of attention to different features are roughly con- sistent with the tuning properties of neurons in extrastriate visual areas discussed in Chapter 10. The important points to take from these and other brain imaging studies are that numerous brain areas appear to be affected by atten- tion and that the particular areas depend on the nature of the behav- ioral task performed. We’ll now examine two of these areas in detail and see how studies in behaving monkeys have clariﬁ ed the neural effects of attention. Attention Enhances Responses of Neurons in Parietal Cortex. The perceptual studies discussed earlier show that attention can be moved independently of eye position. But what happens normally when you move your eyes to explore your environment? Let’s say you are scruti- nizing an object imaged on your fovea when a bright light is ﬂ ashed in your peripheral visual ﬁ eld. What happens to your attention before, dur- ing, and after you make a saccadic eye movement to the ﬂ ashed light? Behavioral studies show that shifts in attention can occur in about 50 msec, whereas saccades take about 200 msec. It appears that attention, initially focused at the fovea, shifts to the peripheral retina and is fol- lowed by the saccade. The assumption that attention changes location prior to an eye move- ment underlies an experiment performed by neurophysiologists Robert Wurtz, Michael Goldberg, and David Robinson at the National Institutes of Health. They recorded from several brain areas in monkeys to deter- mine whether shifts of attention are associated with changes in neural activity. Because of the close relationship between attention and eye movements, the investigation started with parts of the brain involved in generating saccades. The researchers recorded from neurons in the posterior parietal cor- tex of monkeys while the animals performed a simple behavioral task (Figure 21.10). This cortical area is thought to be involved in directing eye movements, in part because electrical stimulation here will evoke saccades. In the experiment, a monkey ﬁ xated on a spot on a computer display and a stimulus was ﬂ ashed on the peripheral retina at the loca- tion of the receptive ﬁ eld under study. The monkey was cued to  either hold ﬁ xation on the initial spot or saccade to the ﬂ ashed stimulus. In either case, the parietal neuron was excited by the stimulus ﬂ ashing in its receptive ﬁ eld (Figure 21.11a). The observation that makes this ex- periment important is that the response to the ﬂ ashed stimulus was sig- niﬁ cantly enhanced when the animal made a saccade to foveate it com- pared to trials in which the monkey held ﬁ xation at the initial location (Figure 21.11b). Remember, the stimulus is the same in both cases. The enhancement effect was seen only when a saccade was made to the re- ceptive ﬁ eld location but not to other locations and even though the sac- cade was made after the neuron responded to the target stimulus. This suggests that attention moves to the end of the planned saccade before the eyes move and only neurons with receptive ﬁ elds at that location have responses enhanced by the attention shift that precedes the saccade (Figure 21.11c). A second interpretation that has to be considered is that the enhanced response was a premotor signal related to coding for the Fixation point Screen Target Shift of gaze due to saccadic eye movement ▲ FIGURE 21.10 A behavioral task for directing a mon- key’s attention. While recordings are made from the posterior parietal cortex, the monkey fixates on a point on a com- puter screen. When a peripheral target appears (usually in a neuron’s receptive field), the animal makes a saccade to the target.

(d) Enhancement is also seen when the task requires the animal to release a hand lever when the peripheral spot dims. (Source: Adapted from Wurtz, Goldberg, and Robinson, 1982, p. 128.) \n733 CHAPTER 21 THE RESTING BRAIN, ATTENTION, AND CONSCIOUSNESS subsequent eye movement, just as neurons in motor cortex ﬁ re before hand movements. To address this possibility, the researchers performed a variation of the experiment in which the animal moved its hand rather than its eyes to indicate the location of the peripherally ﬂ ashed stimulus (Figure 21.11d). Even without a saccade there was an enhanced response to the target in the receptive ﬁ eld suggesting that, rather than a pre- motor signal, the enhanced response was a result of an attention shift needed to accurately perform the task. It’s easy to see how response enhancement of the kind observed in pos- terior parietal cortex might be involved in the behavioral beneﬁ ts of at- tention discussed earlier. If attention drawn to one location in the visual ﬁ eld by a cueing stimulus increases the response to other stimuli near that location, this could account for the spatially selective improvement in the ability to detect a target. Likewise, the augmented response might lead to more rapid visual processing and ultimately faster reaction times, as seen in the perceptual experiments. Attention Focuses Receptive Fields in Area V4. In a fascinating se- ries of experiments, Robert Desimone and his colleagues, then at the National Institute of Mental Health, revealed surprisingly speciﬁ c ef- fects of attention on the receptive ﬁ elds of neurons in visual cortical area V4. In one experiment, monkeys performed a same–different task with pairs of stimuli within the receptive ﬁ elds of V4 neurons. For ex- ample, suppose that a particular V4 cell responded strongly to vertical and horizontal red bars of light in its receptive ﬁ eld but did not respond to vertical or horizontal green bars. The red bars were “effective” stimuli and the green bars were “ineffective” stimuli. While the monkey ﬁ xated, two stimuli (each either effective or ineffective) were brieﬂ y presented at different locations in the receptive ﬁ eld, and after a delay period, two more stimuli were presented at the same locations. In an experimental session, the animal was cued to base its same–different judgments on the successive stimuli at one of the two locations within the receptive ﬁ eld. In other words, the animal had to pay attention to one location in the receptive ﬁ eld but ignore the other in order to perform the task. The animal pushed a lever one way with its hand if the successive stimuli at the attended location were the same, and the opposite way if the stimuli were different. Consider what happened in a trial when effective stimuli appeared at the attended location and ineffective stimuli appeared at the other loca- tion (Figure 21.12a). Not surprisingly, the V4 neuron responded strongly in this situation because there were perfectly good “effective” stimuli in the receptive ﬁ eld. The monkey was then cued to base its same– different judgments on the stimuli at the other location in the recep- tive ﬁ eld (Figure 21.12b). At this location, only green ineffective stimuli were presented. The response of the neuron should have been the same as before because exactly the same stimuli were in the receptive ﬁ eld, right? Surprisingly, that is not what they observed. Even though the stimuli were identical, on average the responses of V4 neurons were less than half as great when the animal attended to the area in the neuron’s receptive ﬁ eld containing the ineffective stimuli. It’s as if the receptive ﬁ eld contracted around the attended area, decreasing the response to the effective stimuli at the unattended location. The location-speciﬁ c effect that attention has on neural activity in this experiment may be directly related to the speciﬁ city discussed earlier in the human detec- tion experiment. \n734 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR Brain Circuits for the Control of Attention We have seen that attention has beneﬁ cial effects on visual processing and that it alters the sensitivity of visual neurons. These are the consequences of attention. We now turn to the brain mechanisms that guide attention, a topic that is more difﬁ cult to study because the networks of  cortical and subcortical structures involved are distributed across the brain. Numerous experiments suggest that the brain circuitry responsible for saccadic eye movements plays a critical role in guiding attention. This link is consistent with human behavior because we saccade to objects that are either salient or of behavioral interest. We won’t examine every structure thought to be involved in attention but will highlight a few and suggest how control circuits might be organized. The Pulvinar, a Subcortical Component. One structure that has been studied for its possible role in guiding attention is the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus. Several properties of the pulvinar make it interesting. As in other neocortical areas we have discussed, pulvinar neurons re- spond more robustly when a monkey attends to a stimulus in the recep- tive ﬁ eld than they do to the same stimulus when attention is directed elsewhere. Also, the pulvinar has reciprocal connections with most vi- sual cortical areas of the occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes, giving it the potential to modulate widespread cortical activity (Figure 21.13). Consistent with this anatomical observation, it has been found in mon- keys that when attention is drawn to a pulvinar receptive ﬁ eld, there Frame 1 Fixation point Stimuli Response of V4 neuron when effective stimulus is at attended location in receptive field Response of V4 neuron when ineffective stimulus is at attended location in receptive field Stimuli Receptive field Attended location Frame 2 Frame 1 Frame 2 ON OFF ON OFF Attended location (a) Attention to effective stimulus (b) Attention to ineffective stimulus ▲ FIGURE 21.12 The effect of attention in visual cortical area V4. The yellow circle indicates whether the monkey is attending to (a) the left or (b) the right location in the re- ceptive field. For this neuron, red bars of light are effective in producing a re- sponse and green bars are ineffective. Even though the stimuli are always the same, the neuron’s response is greater when attention is directed to the effective stimuli. (Source: Adapted from Moran and Desimone, 1985, p. 782.) Thalamus Pulvinar nucleus ▲ FIGURE 21.13 Pulvinar projections to the cortex. The pulvinar nucleus is in the posterior thala- mus. It sends widespread efferents to areas of cerebral cortex, including areas V1, V2, MT, parietal cortex, and inferior temporal cortex. \n735 CHAPTER 21 THE RESTING BRAIN, ATTENTION, AND CONSCIOUSNESS is increased synchronization between neural activity in the pulvinar, area V4, and area IT. As the pulvinar provides input to V4 and IT, the hypothesis is that the pulvinar regulates information ﬂ ow in areas of visual cortex. Humans with pulvinar lesions respond abnormally slowly to stimuli on the contralateral side, particularly when there are competing stimuli on the ipsilateral side. It has been proposed that such a deﬁ cit reﬂ ects a reduced ability to focus attention on objects in the contralateral visual ﬁ eld. A similar phenomenon has been observed in monkeys. When mus- cimol, an agonist of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, is unilater- ally injected into the pulvinar, the activity of the neurons is suppressed. Behaviorally, the injection produces difﬁ culty in shifting attention to con- tralateral stimuli, which seems similar to the effect of pulvinar lesions in humans. Interestingly, injection of the GABA antagonist bicuculline appears to facilitate shifting attention to the contralateral side. The Frontal Eye Fields, Eye Movements, and Attention. Tirin Moore and his colleagues, then at Princeton University, examined a cortical area in the frontal lobe known as the frontal eye ﬁ elds or FEF (Figure 21.14). There are direct connections between the FEF and numerous areas known to be inﬂ uenced by attention, including areas V2, V3, V4, MT, and the parietal cortex. Neurons in the FEF have motor ﬁ elds ,  which are small areas in the visual ﬁ eld. If a sufﬁ cient electrical current is passed into the FEF, the eyes rapidly make a saccade to the motor ﬁ eld of the stimulated neurons. In one experiment, Moore et al. trained monkeys to look at a computer display that contained numerous small spots of light. They placed an electrode into the FEF and determined the motor ﬁ eld of the neurons at the electrode’s tip. The animal’s task was to ﬁ xate on the center of the visual display but pay attention to one of the spots, the “target” spot, speciﬁ ed by the experimenter. On each experimental trial, if the target spot dimmed, the monkey moved a lever with its hand. If the spot did not dim, the monkey did not move the lever. By varying the light level, the experimenters measured the minimum light difference or threshold needed by the monkey to detect the dimming. The task was made difﬁ cult for the monkey by “distracter” spots that blinked on and off at random times (Figure 21.15a). Unbeknownst to the monkey, on some trials a very small amount of electrical current was passed into the FEF electrode. Importantly, the cur- rent was insufﬁ cient to drive the eyes to the motor ﬁ eld, and the animal continued to look at the central ﬁ xation point. The aim of the experiment was to determine whether the small electrical stimulation could enhance the animal’s ability to detect the dimming of the target spot, a sort of ar- tiﬁ cial attentional “boost.” The results are summarized in Figure 21.15b. The histogram shows that when the target stimulus was located inside the motor ﬁ eld, the threshold light difference needed to detect dimming of the target was about 10% less with electrical stimulation than with- out. The right side of this histogram shows that performance was not enhanced and may actually have been impaired by electrical stimulation if the target was outside the motor ﬁ eld (as if attention was drawn to the motor ﬁ eld and away from the target). As predicted, electrical stimulation in the FEF improved performance in a manner similar to added atten- tion. Moreover, the effect of electrical stimulation was location speciﬁ c just as attentional modulation normally is. If Moore et al.’s results mean that the FEF is part of a system for di- recting attention and enhancing visual performance in a location-speciﬁ c FEF ▲ FIGURE 21.14 The frontal eye fields (FEF) in a macaque brain.

(b) If the target spot is in the motor field of neurons under study, elec- trical stimulation in the FEF reduces the threshold light difference needed to de- tect that the target spot dimmed. If the target is outside the motor field, electri- cal stimulation slightly increases the threshold. (Source: Adapted from Moore and Fallah, 2001, Fig. 1.) \n736 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR manner, how might this work? One possibility is that FEF activity indi- cating the location of a potential future saccadic eye movement feeds back to the cortical areas it is connected to, enhancing activity there. Moore’s research group tested this hypothesis by recording in area V4 during elec- trical stimulation of the FEF. They located electrodes in the two areas so that the motor ﬁ eld of the neurons in the FEF overlapped the visual receptive ﬁ elds of the V4 neurons. A visual stimulus was used to excite the V4 neuron, and after a 500 msec delay the FEF was electrically stim- ulated on some trials. Figure 21.16 shows that when the FEF was stimu- lated (with a current insufﬁ cient to evoke a saccade), the visual response of the V4 neuron was increased (red) compared to trials without FEF stimulation (black). Without a visual stimulus to excite the V4 neuron, there was no effect of FEF stimulation on the V4 response, suggesting that the increased V4 activity was an enhancement of a visual response rather than a direct consequence of electrical stimulation. Taken together, Moore’s experiments suggest that FEF stimulation mimics both the physiological and behavioral effects of attention. Other scientists have found similar results with electrical stimulation of the superior colliculus, another structure involved in generating saccadic eye movements. These ﬁ ndings make a compelling case that the guidance of attention is integrated with a system involving the FEF and superior col- liculus that is used to move the eyes. Directing Attention with Salience and Priority Maps. In the search for brain processes involved in directing attention, we must consider both bottom–up attention drawn by a stimulus and top–down attention that moves to objects of behavioral importance. A now-common hypothesis to explain how certain visual features grab your attention (e.g., the yellow dandelion surrounded by green grass) is a salience map ,  an idea in- troduced by Laurent Itti and Christof Koch at Caltech. Rather than a brain map showing the locations of objects, a salience map shows the loca- tions of conspicuous features. This concept is illustrated in Figure 21.17. In Chapter 10, we saw that the visual system has neurons selective for a variety of stimulus attributes, such as orientation, color, and motion, and that visual cortex is organized on the basis of these features (e.g., orientation columns). The ﬁ rst stage in the salience map model consists of maps of individual features that locate areas of high feature contrast (e.g., changes from rightward to leftward movement or red to green). Through neural interactions within a map, a form of competition might suppress responses associated with lower feature contrast. The locations of high contrast in each feature map feed into a salience map that locates areas of high contrast irrespective of the speciﬁ c features. Competition between the locations with high contrast leads to a winning location to which  attention is moved. To prevent attention from getting stuck at the single most salient location, however, “inhibition of return” prevents suc- cessive attentional loci from being the same. As described, this model accounts only for bottom–up guidance of attention. We can add top–down attentional modulation to the model in Figure 21.17 by inserting top–down cognitive input to either the feature maps (“I’m looking for a friend wearing a red hat”) or the salience map (“I remember the key ﬁ gure was on the right side of the page in the text- book”). With this addition, our model no longer simply indicates salience (a bottom–up property of stimuli) but instead indicates attentional prior- ity. A priority map is a map showing locations where attention should be directed based on stimulus salience and cognitive input. In other words, a priority map is a salience map plus top–down effects.

(a) A small electrical current is passed into the FEF while the activity of a neuron in V4 is recorded. (b) A stimu- lus is presented in the V4 receptive field at time zero. The histogram shows that the response to the visual stimulus peaks after a short delay and then de- clines. After 500 msec, the FEF is elec- trically stimulated (downward arrow) on some trials (red) but not on other trials (black). Prior to 500 msec, the V4 re- sponse to the visual stimulus was similar whether the stimulus was or was not fol- lowed by FEF stimulation. After 500 msec, the V4 response was greater on trials with FEF stimulation (red) than on trials without (black). (Source: Adapted from Moore and Armstrong, 2003, p. 371.) \n737 CHAPTER 21 THE RESTING BRAIN, ATTENTION, AND CONSCIOUSNESS A Priority Map in the Parietal Lobe. Salience and priority maps have been studied in visual cortical areas (e.g., V1, V4) as well as cortical areas in the parietal and frontal lobes. In a series of studies, Michael Goldberg at Columbia University, James Bisley at the University of California, Los Angeles, and their colleagues have shown that the lateral intraparietal cortex (area LIP) appears to construct a priority map based on both bottom–up and top–down inputs (Figure 21.18). Area LIP plays an im- portant role in directing eye movements, a function clearly related to the guidance of attention. Lesions in the parietal cortex are also associated with the neglect syndrome ,  in which there is an inability to attend to half of the environment (Box 21.2). An experiment demonstrates a salience effect in LIP that is akin to the experience you might have walking into a familiar room: You might not pay any attention to an old sofa or light ﬁ xture on the wall of your liv- ing room at home, but your attention would be captured by a new puppy jumping on the ﬂ oor. In the experiment, a monkey ﬁ rst sees a computer display, and a neuron in area LIP is shown to respond when an object, say a star, is ﬂ ashed in its receptive ﬁ eld (Figure 21.19a). In the second experiment, eight objects are on the computer display and one of them is the star. The animal initially ﬁ xates a point on the bottom of the display such that the LIP neuron’s receptive ﬁ eld does not encompass any of the objects. When the ﬁ xation point is moved to the center of the display, the animal makes a saccade that brings the star into the receptive ﬁ eld. Figure 21.19b shows that there is little response in this situation. In a third experiment, the animal ﬁ xates the same location at the bottom of the computer display, and all of the stimuli are shown except for the star (none of the stimuli are in the receptive ﬁ eld). Then, about 500 msec be- fore the animal makes a saccade to the central ﬁ xation point, the star is turned on. When the central ﬁ xation point is displayed, the animal makes a saccade to it and the neuron responds vigorously to the star (Figure 21.19c). Note that in this last version of the experiment, the star is not in the receptive ﬁ eld when it is turned on. By the time the eyes move and the star enters the receptive ﬁ eld, the eight objects on the display are FIGURE 21.17 Guiding attention with a salience map. An influential hypothesis for the guidance of attention is that the brain uses a sa- lience map to determine where and what we should attend to. The visual input is analyzed by neurons that are sensitive to the spatial scale of stimulus elements and other stimulus features such as color, intensity, orientation, motion, and so on. The maps for these individual fea- tures determine where there are signifi- cant changes in each parameter, such as a transition from one color to another, light to dark, or contours with different orientation. The feature maps are com- bined into a salience map that identifies a “winner”—the most conspicuous ob- ject across feature maps that will be- come the next attended location, in this case a bag of money. To ensure the sys- tem does not become locked on a single salient object, the “inhibition of return” feedback ensures that a current target of attention is inhibited from being the next. As indicated at the lower right, attention is also influenced by top–down factors. (Source: Itti and Koch 2001, Fig. 1.)

Some have argued that this syndrome is a unilateral deﬁ cit in attention. The manifestations of a neglect syndrome can be so bizarre that they’re hard to believe if not directly observed. In mild cases, the behavior may not be apparent with casual observation. But in severe cases, patients act as if half the universe no longer exists. They may shave only one side of their face, brush the teeth on only one side of their mouth, dress only one side of their body, and eat food from only one side of the plate. Because neglect syndrome is less common following left hemispheric damage, it has primarily been studied in regard to neglect of the left half of space as a result of damage to right cerebral cortex. In addition to neglecting objects to the left side, some patients exhibit denial. For instance, they may say that their left hand isn’t really paralyzed or, in extreme cases, may refuse to believe that a limb on their left side is part of their body. Refer to Figure 12.24 in Chapter 12 as a typical example of the distorted sense of space these patients have. If asked to make a drawing, they may crowd everything into the right half, leaving the left half blank. A particularly dra- matic example is the paintings shown in Figure A, which were painted by an artist as he recovered from a stroke. If patients with a neglect syndrome are asked to close their eyes and point toward the midline of their body, they typically point too far to the right, as if there has been shrink- age of the left half. If blindfolded and asked to explore objects placed on a table before them, patients behave normally in exploring objects to the right but are haphazard about prob- ing to the left. All of these examples point toward a problem in relating to the space around them. Neglect syndrome is most commonly associated with le- sions in posterior parietal cortex in the right hemisphere, but it has also been reported to occur following damage to right hemisphere prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and other areas. It has been proposed that the posterior parietal cor- tex is involved in attending to objects at different positions in extrapersonal space. If this is true, then neglect syndrome might be a disruption of the ability to shift attention. One piece of evidence supporting this hypothesis is that objects in the right visual ﬁ eld of patients with a neglect syndrome are sometimes abnormally effective in capturing attention, and patients may experience difﬁ culty disengaging their attention from an object on this side. It is not clear why the syndrome more often accompanies right hemispheric damage than left hemispheric damage. The right hemisphere appears to be dominant for  understanding spatial relationships, and in split-brain studies, it has been shown to be superior at solving complex puzzles. This  ﬁ nding seems consistent with the greater loss of spatial sense after right hemispheric lesions. One hypothesis is that the left hemisphere is involved in attending to objects in the right visual ﬁ eld, whereas the right hemisphere is involved in at- tending to objects in the left and right visual ﬁ elds. While this would account for the asymmetrical effects of left and right hemispheric lesions, at present there is only suggestive evi- dence in support of such a hypothesis. One ﬁ nal riddle about neglect syndrome is that there is partial or complete recovery in a matter of months (in the ﬁ gure, note the recovery in the self-portraits). Figure A Self-portraits during recovery from a stroke that caused a neglect syndrome. Two months after suffering a stroke affecting parietal cortex on the right side, the artist made the upper-left portrait. There is virtually no left side to the face in the painting. About 3.5 months after the stroke, there is some detail on the left side but not nearly as much as on the right side (upper right). At 6 months (lower left) and 9 months (lower right) after the stroke, there is increasingly more treatment of the left side of the painting. (Source: Posner and Raichle, 1994, p. 152.) \n739 CHAPTER 21 THE RESTING BRAIN, ATTENTION, AND CONSCIOUSNESS identical to the second experiment. It appears that the large response in the third experiment is a consequence of turning on the star just before it entered the receptive ﬁ eld. The hypothesis is that the stimulus onset catches the animal’s attention and this enhances the response of the LIP neuron. This effect is consistent with a salience map in area LIP in that the neuron’s response is strongly modulated by a conspicuous bottom–up stimulus. A variation of this experiment brings out a top–down attention  effect. This study uses the same eight stimuli, but now they are all always shown (no ﬂ ashing stimuli). As before, the animal ﬁ xates on a point on the computer display such that none of the stimuli are in the receptive ﬁ eld. A small cue stimulus is ﬂ ashed on and off, and this indicates to the animal which of the eight stimuli is of behavioral signiﬁ cance in this ex- perimental trial. In the case illustrated, the LIP neuron does not respond to the star cue because it is outside the receptive ﬁ eld (Figure 21.20a). The ﬁ xation point then moves to the center of the display and the mon- key makes a saccade to this location, bringing the star into the receptive ﬁ eld and the neuron responds to the star (Figure 21.20b). Finally, the animal makes a saccade to the star stimulus and the LIP response ends (Figure 21.20c). Compare this response pattern with that observed with identical stimuli when the cue does not match the stimulus that enters the receptive ﬁ eld. As before there is no response to the cue—now a trian- gle rather than a star (Figure 21.20d). When the animal makes the ﬁ rst saccade, the star enters the receptive ﬁ eld, but the response is much less than before (Figure 21.20e). Finally, the animal makes a second saccade to the triangle (Figure 21.20f). Note that in both the ﬁ rst and second experiments there was a condi- tion in which the animal made a saccade that brought a stable (not previ- ously ﬂ ashed) star stimulus into the receptive ﬁ eld. From Figure 21.19, we conclude that without something like a ﬂ ash to increase its salience, the LIP neuron does not respond very much to the star in its receptive ﬁ eld.

(Source: Adapted from Bisley and Goldberg, 2010, Fig. 2.) \n740 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR In Figure 21.20b, there is a much greater response than in Figure 21.20e presumably because of a top–down signal informing the LIP neuron that in the former case the star is important (for planning the last saccade) even though it isn’t ﬂ ashing. A variety of experiments along these lines suggest that LIP neurons carry information appropriate for a priority map of visual attention. The Frontoparietal Attention Network. As more is learned about brain areas that are affected by attention and areas that appear to hold saliency or priority maps, an outline of circuits involved in attention is emerging.

(Source: Adapted from Bisley and Goldberg, 2010, Fig. 4.) \n741 CHAPTER 21 THE RESTING BRAIN, ATTENTION, AND CONSCIOUSNESS The involved brain areas compose the frontoparietal attention net- work ( Figure 21.21). In bottom–up attention, input from visual areas in the occipital lobe reaches area LIP where the ﬁ rst critical step may be the construction of a salience map based on conspicuous objects in the ﬁ eld of view (see Figure 21.21a). The frontal eye ﬁ elds also contain a salience map, but salience is signaled there after LIP. Through feedback to visual areas and connections with eye movement structures, visual processing of a salient object is enhanced and the eyes may move to foveate the object. Top–down control of attention is directed by behavioral goals, and it is ﬁ tting that the cortical areas in the frontal lobe appear to be critical. Recordings across a range of brain areas show that attention effects fol- low a temporal sequence, occurring ﬁ rst in the frontal lobe (prefrontal cortex and the frontal eye ﬁ elds) and followed progressively by areas LIP, V4 and MT, V2, and then V1 (see Figure 21.21b). The causal relationships in these brain areas are still being investigated, but we can speculate that behavioral goals are established in the frontal and parietal areas, information is processed to create a priority map in LIP and FEF, and (a) (b) FEF LIP V4 V1, V2 Pulvinar and superior colliculus Lateral prefrontal cortex Bottom-up attention Top-down attention FEF LIP V4 V1, V2 Pulvinar and superior colliculus Lateral prefrontal cortex FIGURE 21.21 The frontoparietal attention network in the macaque brain.

Several of these brain areas, including LIP, FEF, and the supe- rior colliculus, also serve to guide saccadic eye movements to scrutinize the objects allocated attention. CONSCIOUSNESS In previous chapters, we discussed the sensory systems that bring in- formation about our world into the brain. In order to serve behavioral goals, we focus our attention on a small subset of the vast sensory input. Presumably other animals make a similar tradeoff: Broadly monitor sen- sory input at a low resolution, perhaps with the default mode network, or ﬁ lter out much of the input and pay attention at a higher resolution to only the information needed at the moment. Consider the next step in the chain of brain events—becoming consciously aware of the world around us. It is probably fair to say neuroscientists tend to be materialists in their attitudes about consciousness, meaning that consciousness arises from physical processes: Like every other product of the brain, consciousness can ultimately be understood as being based on the structure and func- tion of the nervous system. An alternative to materialism is dualism , which states that the mind and body are different things and one can- not be fully explained by the other (i.e., consciousness cannot be fully explained by physical processes). If it is true that consciousness is based on standard physical principles, a logical inference is that it should one day be possible to construct a conscious machine. What Is Consciousness? The nature of human consciousness is a problem that has vexed philoso- phers and scientists for centuries. There are challenges right at the outset; even deﬁ ning consciousness is controversial. Sufﬁ ce it to say  numerous deﬁ nitions have been offered over the years, and numerous models of con- sciousness have been proposed. Our intent is not to jump into this contro- versy. However, considering some of the background issues will lead us to a discussion of the type of neuroscientiﬁ c investigations of consciousness that might be fruitful. Think of the ways we use the word itself. We say that a person who is given a general anesthetic or who is asleep is uncon- scious and that they become conscious when they wake up. If our hair looks weird one day, we might be self-conscious. A person under the inﬂ u- ence of a hallucinogenic drug is said to be in an altered state of conscious- ness. When long wavelength light hits our retina, we have the conscious experience of the color red. But does “conscious” mean the same thing in all of these examples? It seems we use the word in different ways, and understanding these facets of consciousness may involve distinct lines of neuroscientiﬁ c inquiry. In 1995, the philosopher David Chalmers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, proposed a distinction that is helpful starting point. He outlined what he called the easy problems of consciousness and the hard problem. What Chalmers meant by the easy problems of con- sciousness are phenomena that seem answerable by standard scientiﬁ c methodology. For example, what is the difference between being awake and asleep? We don’t know the full answer to this question, but as we saw in Chapter 19, research is revealing much and may someday fully outline the nature of conscious wakefulness. Another example comes from stud- ies of attention. It is sometimes said that we are conscious of things we C O N S C IO U SN ES S \n743 CHAPTER 21 THE RESTING BRAIN, ATTENTION, AND CONSCIOUSNESS pay attention to. Thus experiments on attention may tell us something about consciousness. Other brain functions that may give us insight into consciousness include our ability to integrate information from sensory systems, make decisions about sensory input, and so on. The hard problem of consciousness is the experience itself. We ex- perience the emotion called happiness, the sound of a saxophone, the color blue. Why and how do these subjective experiences arise from physical pro- cesses? When a baby cries, a mother’s soothing touch evokes some pattern of activity in the child’s brain, but why is the internal experience a pleasant one rather than a feeling of pain, such as the smell of burnt toast, or the sound of a car’s horn? We can look for neural activity associated with these experiences (the easy part of the problem), but understanding why the ex- perience is the way it is seems much harder. In reality, none of these prob- lems we’ve mentioned is easy; it may have been more appropriate to refer to the hard problems of consciousness and the seemingly impossible prob- lem! At any rate, our discussion here will be limited to the “easy” problems. Neural Correlates of Consciousness For centuries, the study of consciousness was in the hands of philoso- phers; it was widely considered beyond the reach of experimental science. In recent years, this attitude has changed, and a spectrum of scientists are cutting trails through the challenging landscape of consciousness. To make headway, we should ask questions that offer some hope of solution rather than going immediately after the mysteries of internal experience. Christof Koch and Francis Crick, who was awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on the structure of DNA, were two pioneers who collaborated to bring a neuroscientiﬁ c approach to the study of consciousness (Box 21.3). Koch deﬁ ned neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) as the mini- mal neuronal events sufﬁ cient for a speciﬁ c conscious percept. In other words, what must happen in which neurons for you to experience the taste of a strawberry or the feeling of joy? A general experimental approach that has been taken starts with vi- sual images presented to the eyes that can be seen in two different ways, called bistable images. Well-known examples are shown in Figure 21.22. The question we are interested in is what happens to brain activity when a person or animal switches from one percept to another? For example, in Figure 21.22c, at one moment, you see a bunny and later you see a duck (but not both at the same time). Since the image is always the same, the hypothesis is that changes in neural activity that correlate with changes in perception may be related to our conscious awareness of one object or the other. Experiments along these lines have been conducted both in an- imals with single neuron recordings and in humans with PET and fMRI. Neuronal Correlates of Alternating Perception in Binocular Rivalry. Binocular rivalry is a visual effect that has been put to good use exploring the neural basis of conscious awareness. In binocular rivalry , different images are seen by the two eyes, and perceptual awareness alternates be- tween the two images. For example, if one eye sees vertical lines and the other sees horizontal lines, a person will perceive alternations at random times between only vertical lines, only horizontal lines, and sometimes a patchwork of the two orientations. The two images are always the same and both eyes are always open, so what and where is something switching inside the brain? An experiment along these lines was conducted by David Sheinberg and Nikos Logothetis, then at the Baylor College of Medicine. Recordings were ▲ FIGURE 21.22 Bistable images can be perceived two different ways. (a) The face-vase illu- sion.

(c) A duck or a bunny? \n744 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR made from neurons in inferotemporal cortex (area IT), which we introduced as a high-level vision area in Chapter 10. Instead of vertical and horizontal lines (or ducks and bunnies), stimuli were used that excited IT neurons. Before the experiment, a monkey was trained to pull a left lever if it saw an object from the “left object group” and a right lever if it saw an object from the “right object group.” For the experiment shown in Figure 21.23, the left object group consisted of pictures of starbursts and the right object group was composed of pictures of animal and human faces. Once the animal reliably indicated whether an object from the left or right group was seen without rivalry, neural recordings in IT were made in a rivalry situation. From baseline recordings, the scientists knew that the particular cell under study gave a strong response to the presentation of a monkey face (to either eye) and little or no response to the starburst pattern. In the rivalry experiment shown in the ﬁ gure, a starburst I t was an everyday occurrence in the summer of 1988 that set my life on a new path while I was teaching summer school in Woods Hole on Cape Cod. I had taken an aspirin, but my toothache persisted. Lying in bed, I couldn’t sleep because of the pounding in my lower molar. Trying to distract myself from the pain, I wondered how it came to hurt so much. I knew that an inﬂ ammation of the tooth pulp sends electri- cal activity up one of the branches of the trigeminal nerve. After the signal passes through several relay stations, neo- cortical neurons become active and discharge their electrical impulses. Such bioelectrical activity in this part of the brain goes hand in hand with the consciousness of pain, includ- ing its awful, aching feeling. But how could this physical pro- cess trigger elusive, nonphysical feelings? It’s just a bunch of ions—Na \u0002 , K \u0002 , Cl \u0003 , Ca 2 \u0002 and so on—moving across mem- branes, in principle no different from similar ions sloshing around in my liver or electrons moving onto and off transistor gates in my laptop. As a physicist, I knew that neither quan- tum mechanics nor general relativity, the two most powerful scientiﬁ c theories that all matter has to obey, make any men- tion of consciousness. By dint of what natural law could a highly excitable chunk of organized matter exude something nonphysical and give rise to subjective states, to ephemeral feelings? And so my toothache on that distant summer day set me on a course to explore the seas of consciousness, with the brain as my lodestar. I started what became a 16-year collaboration with Francis Crick at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California. Coauthoring over 20 papers and book chapters, we advocated for an em- pirical research program focused on isolating those neurons and brain regions that are involved in generating a speciﬁ c content of consciousness, such as seeing a horizontal grat- ing rather than a vertical one or seeing red versus green. We felt that no matter what philosophical position people adopt in regard to the mind–body problem, ﬁ nding such neuronal correlates would be a critical step on the way to an ultimate theory of consciousness. Back in 1990, when Francis and I published our ﬁ rst paper on the topic, we were energized by the rediscovery, by Wolf Singer and Charlie Gray in Frankfurt, Germany, of 40 Hz syn- chronized oscillations in the ﬁ ring pattern of neurons in the visual cortex of cats. We argued that this so-called “gamma band” activity was one of the hallmarks of consciousness. Reality has turned out more complex than that. Today, it is known that such oscillatory activity, widespread in the cortex of all species investigated so far, is probably more closely tied to selective attention than to consciousness, even though these two processes are often intimately relayed. We debated endlessly between ourselves and with a small number of colleagues willing to publicly think about this hitherto banned subject—Nikos Logothetis, Wolf Singer, David Chalmers, Patricia Churchland, Giulio Tononi, and V.S. Ramachandran, to mention a few—about nerve cells and their circuits, both those that must be involved in con- sciousness and those that give rise to the myriad types of unconscious behaviors (which we dubbed “zombie systems”) such as speed typing, moving the eyes, adjusting limbs in a dynamic environment, and so on. Today, the study of the P A T H  O F  D I S C O V E R Y BOX 21.3 Tracking the Neuronal Footprints of Consciousness \n745 CHAPTER 21 THE RESTING BRAIN, ATTENTION, AND CONSCIOUSNESS stimulus was presented to the left eye and a monkey face to the right eye. Based on its training, the monkey alternately pulled the left or right lever suggesting that it alternately perceived the starburst or monkey face. The striking result seen in the neural recording is that the response of the IT neuron ﬂ uctuated between low and high activity roughly in sync with the animal pulling the left or right lever, even though the stimulus was ﬁ xed. The results from this experiment and others indicate that there is a correspondence between changes in the activity of IT neurons and percep- tion. The implication is that binocular rivalry produces an alternation in the conscious awareness the monkey has of the rivalrous images and that neural activity in IT may be a neural correlate of this awareness. Similar experiments in other brain areas of the monkey showed that with the rivalry paradigm the neural–perceptual correspondence was relatively neuronal mechanisms underlying both states and content of consciousness is carried out by many in both the clinic and the laboratory, but in 1990 it helped to have a famous Nobel Prize–winning biologist as a coauthor (in particular before attaining the holy state of tenure). We continued to work together until Francis’s death on July 28, 2004. Two days before, he phoned me on the way to the hospital, calmly informing me that his comments on our last manuscript—on a rather obscure brain region called the claustrum , an elongated sheet of neurons underneath the neocortex, and its putative role in consciousness—would be delayed. His wife, Odile Crick, recounted how in the hours before his death Francis hallucinated about rapidly ﬁ ring claustrum neurons—a scientist to the end. Today, as I write these lines, a new clinical case study of an epileptic patient has just been published. The neurologists stimulated elec- trodes implanted into the patient’s brain to discover the lo- cation where her seizures originated. One electrode, located close to the left claustrum, turned the patient’s conscious- ness immediately off, repeatedly, and reversibly, for as long as the electrical stimulation lasted. The patient stared, be- came unresponsive to commands, and later had no recollec- tion of these episodes. Ever data-hungry, how Francis would have loved this! References: Koubeissi MZ, et al. 2014.

For this reason it is speculated that the early areas are less likely to be part of an NCC than area IT. Visual Awareness and Human Brain Activity. Rivalry experiments have also been conducted with human subjects while brain activity is recorded using fMRI. An example is shown in Figure 21.24. Rather than using separate images presented to the left and right eye, a composite image was shown to both eyes; glasses with red and green ﬁ lters assured that one eye saw only the image of the face and the other eye only the house. Subjects indicated which percept they had at different times. Recordings were made from two areas in the temporal lobe. We discussed the fusi- form face area (FFA) in Chapter 10 because it appears to respond pref- erentially to pictures of faces. The parahippocampal place area (PPA) responds to pictures of houses and other places but not to other classes of stimuli. As subjects reported alternations between the face and house percepts, FFA and PPA activity was averaged at each transition. In the rivalry condition, house-to-face perceptual transitions were accompanied by decreases in PPA activity (red lines) and increases in FFA activity (blue lines) (see Figure 21.24a). At face-to-house transitions, FFA activity went down and PPA activity up. Similar alternations in FFA and PPA ac- tivity were seen in non-rivalry conditions in which only the face or house was shown at a time to one eye (see Figure 21.24b). The alternating pat- terns of brain activity in FFA and PPA seen in Figure 21.24a occur during left left eye right eye AND right right 100 Lever pulled: Visual stimulus: 50 0 Spikes/sec Time (sec) 0 5 10 15 20 left left ▲ FIGURE 21.23 Responses of a monkey IT neuron during binocular rivalry. Preliminary testing showed that this neuron in inferotemporal cortex was excited by a photograph of a monkey face but not by a starburst pattern. The top row shows the visual stim- ulus the monkey saw. First, the starburst was shown (blue shading) followed by an ambiguous stimulus (pink shading); both of these stimuli were ineffective in driving the neuron. Next shown was the critical rivalrous condition with the star- burst to the left eye and the monkey face to the right eye (orange shading). Finally, the monkey face was shown alone (blue shading). The second row, below the dashed line, shows which lever the monkey pulled. When the starburst or monkey face was shown alone, the animal appropriately pulled the left or right lever, respectively. In the rivalrous condition, the animal first pulled the left lever, then the right, and finally the left again. The bottom row, below the solid horizon- tal line, shows that with fixed visual input the IT neuron was much less active when the monkey pulled the left lever than when it pulled the right lever. The ver- tical line segments show individual extracellularly recorded action potentials above a smoothed response histogram. (Source: Adapted from Sheinberg and Logothetis 1997, Fig. 3.) \n747 CHAPTER 21 THE RESTING BRAIN, ATTENTION, AND CONSCIOUSNESS constant visual input, suggesting that activity in these areas may be an NCC for faces and houses. A variety of approaches other than binocular rivalry have also been used to explore neural correlates of consciousness. An interesting  example is visual imagery in which a person is instructed to imagine a visual image in their “mind’s eye.” Give it a try: create an image of the house you live in and imagine walking around the house counting the windows as you go. There is evidence suggesting that imagery activates some of the same vi- sual processes driven by external visual stimuli, so imagery seems a valid method for exploring visual consciousness. Gabriel Kreiman and Christof Koch at Caltech with Itzhak Fried at the University of California, Los Angeles, conducted an imagery experiment that included recordings from human neurons. For the clinical assessment of epileptic foci, elec- trodes were placed in a variety of brain structures. The neuron shown in Figure 21.25 was located in entorhinal cortex, an area in the medial tem- poral lobe that provides input to the hippocampus. After trying a variety of visual stimuli, it was determined that the neuron responded vigorously to a photograph of dolphins, but little response was evoked by a picture of a girl’s face (see Figure 21.25a). The subject was then asked to close his eyes. His task was to imagine the photo of the dolphins when a high tone was presented and imagine the girl’s face with a low tone.

(a) In the ri- valry condition a subject viewed the top visual stimulus through glasses with red and green lenses so that one eye saw a face and the other eye saw a house. The subject alternately perceived the face and house (“percept”). fMRI was used to measure brain activity in two temporal lobe areas: the fusiform face area (FFA) that responds more to faces than other stimuli, and the parahippocampal place area (PPA) that responds to houses and places but not to faces. The data are averaged over many perceptual transitions from house to face and face to house. Even though the stimulus is fixed, the FFA is more active when the face is per- ceived (blue line) and the PPA is more active when the house is seen (red line). (b) In the non-rivalry condition, the face and house stimuli were shown alternately to one eye. Responses from the FFA and PPA are consistent with the presenta- tion of the face or house stimulus.

The re- sponses aren’t identical to the visually evoked responses, but there is clearly more activity when the person imagines the dolphin photo than the face photo. In this case, might entorhinal cortex be part of an NCC? Challenges in the Study of Consciousness. Consciousness is a subject of great interest and discussion, but it is slippery to pin down. In an effort to be concrete, our discussion has focused on neural correlates of conscious- ness (the “easy” problems). We have seen several brain areas in which activity changes in a manner correlated with conscious awareness. These candidate NCC areas are joined by more that we have not discussed. In addition to the fMRI studies, electrode recordings made in a range of cortical areas in animals and humans show responses correlated with awareness even in single cells. Taken together, the experimental ﬁ ndings are encouraging that baby steps may take us closer to an understanding of consciousness, at least in a limited sense. That said, challenges abound in the interpretation of consciousness studies. The goal in the search for neural correlates of consciousness is to ﬁ nd the minimal brain activity sufﬁ cient for some conscious experience. The word “minimal” poses some problems. When NCC areas are proposed, one must always consider the possibility of “contamination.” Might the neural activity under study be a prerequisite for the conscious experience or a consequence of the experience but not the neural substrate of the experience? Might the NCC actually be coordinated or correlated activity spread across multiple brain areas rather than the activity of any indi- vidual area? As attention is usually linked to conscious awareness, might activity in a candidate NCC confound attention with awareness? The connection between attention and consciousness is important and controversial. For many years, these words were taken to be nearly syn- onymous. However, recent perceptual experiments have demonstrated 1000 msec 1000 msec Visual imagery Visual presentation (a) (b) FIGURE 21.25 A human neuron active during visual imagery.

(Source: Adapted from Crick et al., 2004, Fig. 5.) \n749 CHAPTER 21 THE RESTING BRAIN, ATTENTION, AND CONSCIOUSNESS that it is possible to have your attention drawn to an object but still not perceive it. The implication is that attention is or can be independent of awareness. There are also studies reporting the opposite, that aware- ness can occur without attention, although that conclusion remains contentious. Finally, there is uncertainty about where in the brain NCCs are ob- served. We discussed several experiments that used binocular rivalry to locate NCCs. Unfortunately, the various studies do not ﬁ t neatly together. For example, it has been found using fMRI that brain activity stretching from early visual areas such as the LGN and V1 to later visual areas such as IT changes systematically when people and animals report switches in rivalrous percepts. Contrast this with animal experiments using elec- trodes that show single cell response modulation in extrastriate cortex but much less in earlier structures. The difference may be a technical fac- tor associated with the recording techniques or perhaps the spatial scale and magnitude of conscious modulation. Another conclusion reached in a recent fMRI study is that some investigations of NCCs do not adequately control attention. In other words, awareness may be reﬂ ected only in later areas; what looks like awareness correlations in earlier areas may actually reﬂ ect changes in attention rather than awareness. Despite the concerns we’ve discussed, the neuroscientiﬁ c investigation of consciousness has made huge strides in the past 20 years. Examining situations in which a single sensory input, visual or otherwise, gives rise to more than one percept offers fascinating opportunities for identifying neural correlates of consciousness. This leaves open the “hard problem” of consciousness, but it is a start. CONCLUDING REMARKS In this chapter, we have explored the dynamics of brain activity at a broad scale. Consistent changes between the brain at rest and the be- haviorally active brain have been used to deﬁ ne a default mode network. Moving from a restful state to an active one appears to involve a global switch in brain function from the default pattern to processing tailored to behavioral needs. We cannot say with certainty what the resting state activities are, but they likely include monitoring the environment and daydreaming. When we studied sensory and motor systems, we did so in isolation. The reality of behavior is obviously different: Sensory information comes in, we attend to a small portion of it that is momentarily important, and we generate motor outputs. Attention is a crucial link in this process. Some animals can surely function without attention, having nervous sys- tems that hardwire behavioral responses to speciﬁ c types of sensory input (e.g., threats). However, attention confers ﬂ exibility. In some situations, attention is “grabbed,” but in many others, we use attention as a tool to focus our mental resources. We have seen that this involves a network of brain areas that, based on thoughts and goals, constructs priority maps for the allocation of attention followed by selective enhanced processing in sensory cortex. How we become consciously aware of the information we attend to re- mains a mystery. We have sidestepped the “hard problem of conscious- ness,” the reasons why experiences feel the way they do. On the other hand, progress is being made in the hunt for neural correlates of consciousness. As consciousness involves holding information in mind, it surely involves interactions with the memory systems we will explore in Chapter 24.
