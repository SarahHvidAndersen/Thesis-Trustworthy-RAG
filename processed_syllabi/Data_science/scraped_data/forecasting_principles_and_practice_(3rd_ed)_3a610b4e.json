    "text": "Figure9.32shows the ACFs for 36 random numbers, 360 random numbers and 1,000 random numbers. Figure 9.32: Left: ACF for a white noise series of 36 numbers. Middle: ACF for a white noise series of 360 numbers. Right: ACF for a white noise series of 1,000 numbers. A classic example of a non-stationary series are stock prices. Plot the daily closing prices for Amazon stock (contained ingafa_stock), along with the ACF and PACF. Explain how each plot shows that the series is non-stationary and should be differenced. For the following series, find an appropriate Box-Cox transformation and order of differencing in order to obtain stationary data. For thesouvenirsdata, write down the differences you chose above using backshift operator notation. For your retail data (from Exercise 7 in Section2.10), find the appropriate order of differencing (after transformation if necessary) to obtain stationary data. Simulate and plot some data from simple ARIMA models. Use the following R code to generate data from an AR(1) model with\\(\\phi_{1} = 0.6\\)and\\(\\sigma^2=1\\). The process starts with\\(y_1=0\\). Produce a time plot for the series. How does the plot change as you change\\(\\phi_1\\)? Write your own code to generate data from an MA(1) model with\\(\\theta_{1} = 0.6\\)and\\(\\sigma^2=1\\). Produce a time plot for the series. How does the plot change as you change\\(\\theta_1\\)? Generate data from an ARMA(1,1) model with\\(\\phi_{1} = 0.6\\),\\(\\theta_{1} = 0.6\\)and\\(\\sigma^2=1\\). Generate data from an AR(2) model with\\(\\phi_{1} =-0.8\\),\\(\\phi_{2} = 0.3\\)and\\(\\sigma^2=1\\). (Note that these parameters will give a non-stationary series.) Graph the latter two series and compare them. Consideraus_airpassengers, the total number of passengers (in millions) from Australian air carriers for the period 1970-2011. For the United States GDP series (fromglobal_economy): Consideraus_arrivals, the quarterly number of international visitors to Australia from several countries for the period 1981 Q1 â 2012 Q3. Choose a series fromus_employment, the total employment in different industries in the United States. Choose one of the following seasonal time series: the Australian production of electricity, cement, or gas (fromaus_production). For the same time series you used in the previous exercise, try using a non-seasonal model applied to the seasonally adjusted data obtained from STL. Compare the forecasts with those obtained in the previous exercise. Which do you think is the best approach? For the Australian tourism data (fromtourism): For your retail time series (Exercise 5 above): Consider the number of Snowshoe Hare furs traded by the Hudson Bay Company between 1845 and 1935 (data setpelt). Produce a time plot of the time series. Assume you decide to fit the following model:\\[\n   y_t = c + \\phi_1 y_{t-1} + \\phi_2 y_{t-2} + \\phi_3 y_{t-3} + \\phi_4 y_{t-4} + \\varepsilon_t,\n\\]where\\(\\varepsilon_t\\)is a white noise series. What sort of ARIMA model is this (i.e., what are\\(p\\),\\(d\\), and\\(q\\))? By examining the ACF and PACF of the data, explain why this model is appropriate. The last five values of the series are given below: The estimated parameters are\\(c = 30993\\),\\(\\phi_1 = 0.82\\),\\(\\phi_2 = -0.29\\),\\(\\phi_3 = -0.01\\), and\\(\\phi_4 = -0.22\\).\nWithout using theforecast()function, calculate forecasts for the next three years (1936â1939). Now fit the model in R and obtain the forecasts usingforecast(). How are they different from yours? Why? The population of Switzerland from 1960 to 2017 is in data setglobal_economy. Produce a time plot of the data. You decide to fit the following model to the series:\\[y_t = c + y_{t-1} + \\phi_1 (y_{t-1} - y_{t-2}) + \\phi_2 (y_{t-2} - y_{t-3}) + \\phi_3( y_{t-3} - y_{t-4}) + \\varepsilon_t\\]where\\(y_t\\)is the Population in year\\(t\\)and\\(\\varepsilon_t\\)is a white noise series.\nWhat sort of ARIMA model is this (i.e., what are\\(p\\),\\(d\\), and\\(q\\))? Explain why this model was chosen using the ACF and PACF of the differenced series. The last five values of the series are given below. The estimated parameters are\\(c = 0.0053\\),\\(\\phi_1 = 1.64\\),\\(\\phi_2 = -1.17\\), and\\(\\phi_3 = 0.45\\).\nWithout using theforecast()function, calculate forecasts for the next three years (2018â2020). Now fit the model in R and obtain the forecasts from the same model. How are they different from yours? Why?"
