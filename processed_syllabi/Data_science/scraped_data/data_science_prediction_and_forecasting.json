In particular, students are introduced to state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of time series. In this area, a particular focus is placed on prediction and forecasting. Examples of relevant data sets are publicly available unit sales time series from large multinational companies, financial market time series, behavioural time series from cognitive-scientific and neuroscientific experimental studies, social media network data, data from wearable technology, and data from interactive sensors. Students will also be able to recognise important ethical, social, and policy implications arising from the application of advanced statistical analysis to human data, and to reflect on the ethical choices that must be made when developing data processing and statistical analysis software.\nThe course covers advanced tools in data science, time series analysis, prediction, and forecasting. The course relates these tools to experimental and lab methodology, and to theories of cognitive functions. The course also includes integrated discussion of the ethical, social, and policy implications of the use of data science.\nThe course equips students with the computational tools to model and investigate human cognition and behaviour both at the individual and at the collective level. The course prepares students for a wide range of data processing and analysis career paths.\nAcademic objectives:\nIn the evaluation of the student’s performance, emphasis is placed on the extent to which the student is able to:\nKnowledge:\n- describe and contrast different computational and statistical methods for analysing large and complex data sets, in particular time series.\nSkills:\n- identify relevant data sources for specific research and applied questions, and integrate data sources as needed\n- prepare and pre-process complex data for analysis\n- create visualisation of time series and other complex data.\nCompetences:\n- clearly and effectively present the results of complex analyses, in a way that is understood by non-specialists\n- critically evaluate the appropriateness of a given method for a given data set\n- recognise and analyse ethical, social, and policy issues arising from the use of data science methods and technology.\nSee all\nECTS\n10\nLevel\nMaster\nSemester\nMA, 2nd semester\nLanguage of instruction\nEnglish\nHours - week - period\nTime and place will be announced no later than at the start of the semester here:\nhttps://timetable.au.dk/schedule\nType of course\nOrdinary\nPrimary programme\nMaster's Degree Programme in Cognitive Science\nDepartment\nSchool of Communication and Culture\nFaculty\nArts\nLocation\nAarhus\nSTADS UVA code\n147222U007\nCopy UVA code\nTeaching\nForm of instruction\nLecture\nInstructor\nSee all\nRoberta Rocca\nInstitut for Kultur og Samfund - Interacting Minds (IMC)\nComments on the form of instruction\nRead more\nLectures and classroom instruction.\nLanguage of instruction:\nThe rules governing language of exam and teaching are stated in section 2.1 of the academic regulations.\nLiterature\nRead more\nWill be announced on Brightspace at the start of the semester.\nExamination\nForm of examination\nTake-home assignment on topic of student's choice\nForm of co-examination\nInternal co-examination\nAssessment\n7-point grading scale\nPermitted exam aids\nNot specified\nComments\nRead more\nOrdinary exam and re-examination:\nThe examination consists of a take-home assignment on a topic of the student’s choice and a related practical product.\nThe assignment can be written individually or in groups of up to 4 students. Group assignments must be written in such a way that the contribution of each student, except for the introduction, thesis statement and conclusion, can form the basis of individual assessment. The assignment should clearly state which student is responsible for which section.\nLength for one student: 10-12 standard pages\nLength for two students: 17-22 standard pages\nLength for three students: 24-32 standard pages\nLength for four students: 31-42 standard pages\nThe scope and nature of the product must be relevant in relation to the content of the course and is subject to the approval of the teacher. It must be possible to submit the product digitally in a documented form which can be accessed by the examiner and co-examiner.\nThe product must be accompanied by a take-home assignment on a topic of the student’s choice, in which the student explains the relevance and methodological and theoretical basis of the product.\nThe assignment and the product must be submitted for assessment in WISEflow before the deadline set in the examination plan. Assessment is based on an overall assessment of the take-home assignment and the practical product.",
