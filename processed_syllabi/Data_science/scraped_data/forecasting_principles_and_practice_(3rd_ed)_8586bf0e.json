    "text": "Consider the GDP information inglobal_economy. Plot the GDP per capita for each country over time. Which country has the highest GDP per capita? How has this changed over time? For each of the following series, make a graph of the data. If transforming seems appropriate, do so and describe the effect. Why is a Box-Cox transformation unhelpful for thecanadian_gasdata? What Box-Cox transformation would you select for your retail data (from Exercise 7 in Section2.10)? For the following series, find an appropriate Box-Cox transformation in order to stabilise the variance. Tobacco fromaus_production, Economy class passengers between Melbourne and Sydney fromansett, and Pedestrian counts at Southern Cross Station frompedestrian. Show that a\\(3\\times5\\)MA is equivalent to a 7-term weighted moving average with weights of 0.067, 0.133, 0.200, 0.200, 0.200, 0.133, and 0.067. Consider the last five years of the Gas data fromaus_production. Recall your retail time series data (from Exercise 7 in Section2.10).\nDecompose the series using X-11. Does it reveal any outliers, or unusual features that you had not noticed previously? Figures3.19and3.20show the result of decomposing the number of persons in the civilian labour force in Australia each month from February 1978 to August 1995. Figure 3.19: Decomposition of the number of persons in the civilian labour force in Australia each month from February 1978 to August 1995. Figure 3.20: Seasonal component from the decomposition shown in the previous figure. This exercise uses thecanadian_gasdata (monthly Canadian gas production in billions of cubic metres, January 1960 â February 2005). The evolving seasonal pattern is possibly due to changes in the regulation of gas prices â thanks to Lewis Kirvan for pointing this out.â©ï¸"
