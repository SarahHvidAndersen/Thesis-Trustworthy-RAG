    "text": "The backward shift operator is convenient for describing the process ofdifferencing. A first difference can be written as\\[\n  y'_{t} = y_{t} - y_{t-1} = y_t - By_{t} = (1 - B)y_{t}\\: .\n\\]So a first difference can be represented by\\((1 - B)\\). Similarly, if second-order differences have to be computed, then:\\[\n  y''_{t} = y_{t} - 2y_{t - 1} + y_{t - 2} = (1-2B+B^2)y_t = (1 - B)^{2} y_{t}\\: .\n\\]In general, a\\(d\\)th-order difference can be written as\\[\n  (1 - B)^{d} y_{t}.\n\\] Backshift notation is particularly useful when combining differences, as the operator can be treated using ordinary algebraic rules. In particular, terms involving\\(B\\)can be multiplied together. For example, a seasonal difference followed by a first difference can be written as\\[\\begin{align*}\n(1-B)(1-B^m)y_t &= (1 - B - B^m + B^{m+1})y_t \\\\\n&= y_t-y_{t-1}-y_{t-m}+y_{t-m-1},\n\\end{align*}\\]the same result we obtained earlier."
