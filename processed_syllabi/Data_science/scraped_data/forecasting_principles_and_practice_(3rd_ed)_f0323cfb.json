    "text": "Half-hourly electricity demand for Victoria, Australia is contained invic_elec. Extract the January 2014 electricity demand, and aggregate this data to daily with daily total demands and maximum temperatures. Plot the data and find the regression model for Demand with temperature as a predictor variable. Why is there a positive relationship? Produce a residual plot. Is the model adequate? Are there any outliers or influential observations? Use the model to forecast the electricity demand that you would expect for the next day if the maximum temperature was\\(15^\\circ \\text{C}\\)and compare it with the forecast if the with maximum temperature was\\(35^\\circ \\text{C}\\). Do you believe these forecasts? The following R code will get you started: Give prediction intervals for your forecasts. Plot Demand vs Temperature for all of the available data invic_elecaggregated to daily total demand and maximum temperature. What does this say about your model? Data setolympic_runningcontains the winning times (in seconds) in each Olympic Games sprint, middle-distance and long-distance track events from 1896 to 2016. An elasticity coefficient is the ratio of the percentage change in the forecast variable (\\(y\\)) to the percentage change in the predictor variable (\\(x\\)). Mathematically, the elasticity is defined as\\((dy/dx)\\times(x/y)\\). Consider the log-log model,\\[\n   \\log y=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 \\log x + \\varepsilon.\n\\]Express\\(y\\)as a function of\\(x\\)and show that the coefficient\\(\\beta_1\\)is the elasticity coefficient. The data setsouvenirsconcerns the monthly sales figures of a shop which opened in January 1987 and sells gifts, souvenirs, and novelties. The shop is situated on the wharf at a beach resort town in Queensland, Australia. The sales volume varies with the seasonal population of tourists. There is a large influx of visitors to the town at Christmas and for the local surfing festival, held every March since 1988. Over time, the shop has expanded its premises, range of products, and staff. Theus_gasolineseries consists of weekly data for supplies of US finished motor gasoline product, from 2 February 1991 to 20 January 2017. The units are in âmillion barrels per dayâ. Consider only the data to the end of 2004. The annual population of Afghanistan is available in theglobal_economydata set. (For advanced readers following on from Section7.9). Using matrix notation it was shown that if\\(\\bm{y}=\\bm{X}\\bm{\\beta}+\\bm{\\varepsilon}\\), where\\(\\bm{\\varepsilon}\\)has mean\\(\\bm{0}\\)and variance matrix\\(\\sigma^2\\bm{I}\\), the estimated coefficients are given by\\(\\hat{\\bm{\\beta}}=(\\bm{X}'\\bm{X})^{-1}\\bm{X}'\\bm{y}\\)and a forecast is given by\\(\\hat{y}=\\bm{x}^*\\hat{\\bm{\\beta}}=\\bm{x}^*(\\bm{X}'\\bm{X})^{-1}\\bm{X}'\\bm{y}\\)where\\(\\bm{x}^*\\)is a row vector containing the values of the predictors for the forecast (in the same format as\\(\\bm{X}\\)), and the forecast variance is given by\\(\\text{Var}(\\hat{y})=\\sigma^2 \\left[1+\\bm{x}^*(\\bm{X}'\\bm{X})^{-1}(\\bm{x}^*)'\\right].\\) Consider the simple time trend model where\\(y_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1t\\). Using the following results,\\[\n   \\sum^{T}_{t=1}{t}=\\frac{1}{2}T(T+1),\\quad \\sum^{T}_{t=1}{t^2}=\\frac{1}{6}T(T+1)(2T+1)\n\\]derive the following expressions: \\(\\displaystyle\\bm{X}'\\bm{X}=\\frac{1}{6}\\left[ \\begin{array}{cc}  6T & 3T(T+1) \\\\  3T(T+1) & T(T+1)(2T+1) \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\displaystyle(\\bm{X}'\\bm{X})^{-1}=\\frac{2}{T(T^2-1)}\\left[ \\begin{array}{cc}  (T+1)(2T+1) & -3(T+1) \\\\  -3(T+1) & 6 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\displaystyle\\hat{\\beta}_0=\\frac{2}{T(T-1)}\\left[(2T+1)\\sum^T_{t=1}y_t-3\\sum^T_{t=1}ty_t \\right]\\) \\(\\displaystyle\\hat{\\beta}_1=\\frac{6}{T(T^2-1)}\\left[2\\sum^T_{t=1}ty_t-(T+1)\\sum^T_{t=1}y_t \\right]\\) \\(\\displaystyle\\text{Var}(\\hat{y}_{t})=\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\left[1+\\frac{2}{T(T-1)}\\left(1-4T-6h+6\\frac{(T+h)^2}{T+1}\\right)\\right]\\)"
