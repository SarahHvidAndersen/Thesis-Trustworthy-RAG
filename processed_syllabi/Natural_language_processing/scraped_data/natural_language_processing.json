The course also introduces students to computational models used in speech and text recognition and prediction, and to models used to generate text and speech outputs in artificial intelligence systems, such as digital assistants and chat bots.\nThe course addresses how we can approach theoretical and applied topics in the cognitive sciences using computational linguistics and natural language processing tools. Examples may include probabilistic topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and word2vec semantic analysis. The course also addresses key ethical topics that arise from the analysis of freely available natural language data, and in the development of natural language processing software and technologies.\nThis course builds on students’ background knowledge in statistics and statistical programming, and introduces students to working with large data sets. The course introduces students to ethical and philosophical topics.\nAcademic objectives:\nIn the evaluation of the student’s performance, emphasis is placed on the extent to which the student is able to:\nKnowledge:\n- contrast different natural language processing methods in terms of their strengths and weaknesses in different use contexts\n- explain how formal and computational analysis of natural language can provide insights into human cognition and behaviour\n- discuss ethical and philosophical issues connected to natural language processing technology applications.\nSkills:\n- identify relevant data sources for specific research and applied questions\n- correctly choose and apply tools for analysing natural language data.\nCompetences:\n- critically reflect on and discuss theoretical and empirical implications of using natural language processing techniques\n- justify the choice between relevant methods and analyses used for specific research questions within the field of natural language processing\n- critically evaluate the appropriateness of a given method for a given natural language data set\n.\nSee all\nECTS\n10\nLevel\nMaster\nSemester\nMA, 1st semester\nLanguage of instruction\nEnglish\nHours - week - period\nTime and place will be announced no later than at the start of the semester here:\nhttps://timetable.au.dk/schedule\nType of course\nOrdinary\nPrimary programme\nMaster's Degree Programme in Cognitive Science\nDepartment\nSchool of Communication and Culture\nFaculty\nArts\nLocation\nAarhus\nSTADS UVA code\n147222U005\nCopy UVA code\nTeaching\nForm of instruction\nClassroom instruction\nInstructor\nSee all\nKenneth Christian Enevoldsen\nInstitut for Kultur og Samfund - Center for Humanities Computing\nComments on the form of instruction\nRead more\nCombination of classroom instruction, individual practical exercises and study group projects.\nLanguage of instruction:\nThe rules governing language of exam and teaching are stated in section 2.1 of the academic regulations.\nLiterature\nRead more\nWill be announced on Brightspace at the start of the semester.\nExamination\nForm of examination\nTake-home assignment on topic of student's choice\nForm of co-examination\nInternal co-examination\nAssessment\n7-point grading scale\nPermitted exam aids\nNot specified\nComments\nRead more\nOrdinary exam and re-examination:\nThe examination consists of a take-home assignment on a topic of the student’s choice and a related practical product.\nThe assignment can be written individually or in groups of up to 4 students. Group assignments must be written in such a way that the contribution of each student, except for the introduction, thesis statement and conclusion, can form the basis of individual assessment. The assignment should clearly state which student is responsible for which section.\nLength for one student: 10-12 standard pages\nLength for two students: 17-22 standard pages\nLength for three students: 24-32 standard pages\nLength for four students: 31-42 standard pages\nThe scope and nature of the product must be relevant in relation to the content of the course and is subject to the approval of the teacher. It must be possible to submit the product digitally in a documented form which can be accessed by the examiner and co-examiner.\nThe product must be accompanied by a take-home assignment on a topic of the student’s choice, in which the student explains the relevance and methodological and theoretical basis of the product.\nThe assignment and the product must be submitted for assessment in WISEflow before the deadline set in the examination plan. Assessment is based on an overall assessment of the take-home assignment and the practical product.",
