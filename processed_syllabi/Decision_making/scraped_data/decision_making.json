These topics may also be covered in the advanced cognitive neuroscience course, and they may be revisited in advanced cognitive modelling.\nAcademic objectives:\nIn the evaluation of the student’s performance, emphasis is placed on the extent to which the student is able to:\nKnowledge:\n- explain conceptual theories of decision-making\n- explain how decision making relates to other cognitive processes\n- explain how empirical research on decision making relates to theory.\nSkills:\n- use philosophical, theoretical, or normative frameworks to assess decision making\n- analyze experimental methodologies relevant for evaluating theories of decision making.\nCompetences:\n- apply conceptual theories, normative frameworks, or formal methods learned in the course to real world decision making.\nSee all\nECTS\n10\nLevel\nMaster\nSemester\nMA, 1st semester\nLanguage of instruction\nEnglish\nHours - week - period\nTime and place will be announced no later than at the start of the semester here:\nhttps://timetable.au.dk/schedule\nType of course\nOrdinary\nPrimary programme\nMaster's Degree Programme in Cognitive Science\nDepartment\nSchool of Communication and Culture\nFaculty\nArts\nLocation\nAarhus\nSTADS UVA code\n147222U004\nCopy UVA code\nTeaching\nForms of instruction\nLecture and classroom instruction\nInstructor\nSee all\nAndreas Højlund\nInstitut for Kommunikation og Kultur - Kognitionsvidenskab\nComments on the form of instruction\nRead more\nLectures and classroom instructions.\nLanguage of instruction:\nThe rules governing language of exam and teaching are stated in section 2.1 of the academic regulations.\nLiterature\nRead more\nWill be announced on Brightspace at the start of the semester.\nExamination\nForm of examination\nTake-home assignment on topic of student's choice\nForm of co-examination\nExternal co-examination\nAssessment\n7-point grading scale\nPermitted exam aids\nNot specified\nComments\nRead more\nOrdinary exam and re-examination:\nThe exam is a take-home assignment on a topic of the student’s choice. The topic and method used in the assignment must be relevant in relation to the content of the course and is subject to the approval of the teacher.\nThe assignment can be written individually or in groups of up to 4 students. Group assignments must be written in such a way that the contribution of each student, except for the introduction, thesis statement and conclusion, can form the basis of individual assessment. The assignment should clearly state which student is responsible for which section.\nLength for one student: 12-15 standard pages\nLength for two students: 19-25 standard pages\nLength for three students: 26-35 standard pages\nLength for four students: 33-45 standard pages\nThe assignment must be submitted for assessment in WISEflow before the deadline set in the examination plan.",
