This post provides links to various resources on getting started with Bayesian modelling using JAGS and R. It discusses: (1) what is JAGS; (2) why you might want to perform Bayesian modelling using JAGS; (3) how to install JAGS; (4) where to find further information on JAGS; (5) where to find examples of JAGS scripts in action; (6) where to ask questions; and (7) some interesting psychological applications of Bayesian modelling. JAGS stands for Just Another Gibbs Sampler. To quote the program author, Martyn Plummer, “It is a program for analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation…” It uses a dialect of the BUGS language, similar but a little different to OpenBUGS and WinBUGS. The question of why you might want to use JAGS can be approached in several different ways: Why Bayesian rather than Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) approaches? Why JAGS/BUGS rather than coding in a low-level language? Why JAGS rather than WinBUGS or OpenBUGS? http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/9202/openbugs-vs-jags More than anything I found that JAGS provided a useful entry point into the world of Bayesian modelling. This in turn appealed to me for several reasons: JAGS runs on Linux, Mac, and Windows. I run JAGS on Ubuntu through an interface with R calledrjags. The following sets out a basic installation process: Themanual for different versions of JAGS is located here. e.g.,the pdf of the manual for 3.1.0. Several particularly relevant sections include: Therjagshelp pdffor information about how to interface with JAGS from R. http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/bayescomputation/lunnbugswithcomments.pdf I find it easier to pick up a new language by playing with examples. The following provides links to example JAGS code, often with accompanying explanations: John Myles White John K. Kruschke BUGS Project Patrick J Mineault Miguel Lobo Simon Jackman Johannes Karreth Myself More broadly, examples and tutorials designed for WinBUGS can generally be adapted to be useful for JAGS. So for example, you can explore these WinBUGS examples: There are several places to ask questions about JAGS, R, and Bayesian statistics. In general, I prefer the Stack Exchange model for asking and answering questions on the internet, although the most important issue is typically where the experts are located. If you want to see some examples of Bayesian modelling applied to psychological data, I found the following articles quite interesting. PDFs are available online. If you know of any other interesting JAGS resources or have any comments about my choice of software for Bayesian data analysis, feel free to post a comment.
