Other lags are unlikely to make much interpretable sense and should be avoided. One way to determine more objectively whether differencing is required is to use aunit root test. These are statistical hypothesis tests of stationarity that are designed for determining whether differencing is required. A number of unit root tests are available, which are based on different assumptions and may lead to conflicting answers. In our analysis, we use theKwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test(Kwiatkowski et al., 1992). In this test, the null hypothesis is that the data are stationary, and we look for evidence that the null hypothesis is false. Consequently, small p-values (e.g., less than 0.05) suggest that differencing is required. The test can be computed using theunitroot_kpss()function. For example, let us apply it to the Google stock price data. The KPSS test p-value is reported as a number between 0.01 and 0.1. If the actual p-value is less than 0.01, it is reported as 0.01; and if the actual p-value is greater than 0.1, it is reported as 0.1. In this case, the p-value is shown as 0.01 (and therefore it may be smaller than that), indicating that the null hypothesis is rejected. That is, the data are not stationary. We can difference the data, and apply the test again. This time, the p-value is reported as 0.1 (and so it could be larger than that). We can conclude that the differenced data appear stationary. This process of using a sequence of KPSS tests to determine the appropriate number of first differences is carried out using theunitroot_ndiffs()feature. As we saw from the KPSS tests above, one difference is required to make thegoogle_2015data stationary. A similar feature for determining whether seasonal differencing is required isunitroot_nsdiffs(), which uses the measure of seasonal strength introduced in Section4.3to determine the appropriate number of seasonal differences required. No seasonal differences are suggested if\\(F_S<0.64\\), otherwise one seasonal difference is suggested', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'online_article', 'title': 'Forecasting: Principles and Practice (3rd ed)', 'author': 'Rob J Hyndman, George Athanasopoulos', 'source': 'https://otexts.com/fpp3/stationarity.html', 'date_published': '23 March 2025', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Data_science_forecasting_principles_and_practice_(3rd_ed)_49804c33.json_chunk_6', 'course': 'Data_science'}, 'bm25_score': 1.5267465114593506, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 1.5976036}, {'id': 'Human_computer_interaction_usability_(user)_testing_101.json_chunk_1', 'text': 'December 1, 20192019-12-01 Share Usabilitytesting (alternately calleduser testing) is a popular UX research methodology. In ausability-testingsession, a researcher (called a “facilitator” or a “moderator”) asks a participant to perform tasks, usually using one or more specific user interfaces. While the participant completes each task, the researcher observes the participant’s behavior and listens for feedback. The phrase “usability testing” is often used interchangeably with “user testing.” The goals of usability testing vary by study, but they usually include: Why do we need to do usability testing?Won’t a good professional UX designer knowhow to design a great user interface? Even the best UX designers can’t design a perfect — or even good enough — user experience withoutiterative designdriven by observations of real usersand of their interactions with the design.

The total number of combinations is huge.The only way to get UX design right is to test it. There are many different types of usability testing, but the core elements in most usability tests arethe facilitator, the tasks, and the participant. The facilitator administers tasks to the participant. As the participant performs these tasks, the facilitator observes the participant’s behavior and listens for feedback. The facilitator may also ask followup questions to elicit detail from the participant. Thefacilitatorguides the participantthrough the test process.

what is cognitive science?,"What a great question!

According to the context, Cognitive Science is an interdisciplinary field that draws from psychology, philosophy, computer science, neuroscience, and anthropology to understand human cognition (Allen, 2017). It's concerned with the study of mental processes, such as perception, attention, memory, language, problem-solving, decision-making, and learning, and how they are represented in the brain.

Cognitive Science is characterized by its focus on understanding cognitive architectures, symbolic representations, and neural networks that underlie human cognition (Allen, 2017). It's an effort to develop computational models of cognition that can be tested against behavioral data and neuroimaging findings (Kurzweil, [1]; Allen, 2017).

The field is also concerned with the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning systems that can simulate human cognitive processes (Russell & Norvig, [2]).

Today we all know that the brain is the organ of the human mind, but the connection between the brain and the mind was not always known. For instance, in a colossal misassociation, the Greek philosopher Aristotle localized the mind in the heart. He thought the function of the brain was to cool the blood. Cognitive psychology is the science of how the mind is organized to produce intelligent thought and how the mind is realized in the brain. This chapter introduces fundamental concepts that set the stage for the rest of the book by addressing the following questions: Why do people study cognitive psychology? Where and when did cognitive psychology originate? How is the mind realized in the body? How do the cells in the brain process information? What parts of the brain are responsible for different functions? What are the methods for studying the brain? Motivations for Studying Cognitive Psychology Intellectual Curiosity As with any scientific inquiry, the thirst for knowledge provides much of the impetus to study cognitive psychology. In this respect, the cognitive psychologist is like the tinkerer who wants to know how a clock works. The human mind is particularly fascinating: It displays a remarkable intelligence and ability to adapt. Yet we are often unaware of the extraordinary aspects of human cognition. Just as when watching a live broadcast of a distant news event we rarely consider the sophisticated technologies that make the broadcast possible, we also rarely think about the sophisticated mental processes that enable us to understand that news event. Cognitive psychologists strive to understand the mechanisms that make such intellectual sophistication possible. The inner workings of the human mind are far more intricate than the most complicated systems of modern technology', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications', 'author': 'John R.

One result has been an explosion of new scientific disciplines, such as computer science, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. The late 20th century witnessed the rise of cognitive science, which studies aspects of human cognition including perception, memory, and reasoning, and has transformed traditional psychology. Much of the impetus for cognitive science comes from the idea that the human mind is in some 2. James Watson and Francis Crick with the famous ‘double helix’—their molecular model of the structure of DNA, discovered in 1953. Philosophy of Science The social sciences, such as economics, anthropology, and sociology, also flourished in the 20th century, though some believe they lag behind the natural sciences in terms of sophistication and predictive power. This raises an interesting methodological question. Should social scientists try to use the same methods as natural scientists, or does their subject matter call for a different approach? We return to this issue in Chapter 7. What is philosophy of science? The principal task of philosophy of science is to analyse the methods of enquiry used in the sciences. You may wonder why this task should fall to philosophers, rather than to the scientists themselves. This is a good question. Part of the answer is that philosophical reflection can uncover assumptions that are implicit in scientific enquiry. To illustrate, consider experimental practice. Suppose a scientist does an experiment and gets a particular result. They repeat the experiment a few times and keep getting the same result. After that they will probably stop, confident that were the experiment repeated again under exactly the same conditions, the same result would obtain. This assumption may seem obvious, but as philosophers we want to question it. Why assume that future repetitions of the experiment will yield the same result? How do we know this is true? The scientist is unlikely to spend much time puzzling over this: they probably have better things to do', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Philosophy of Science: Very Short Introduction', 'author': 'Okasha, Samir', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\philosophy_of_cognitive_science\\pdf_material\\okasha_2016_Philosophy of Science A Very Short Introduction.pdf', 'date_published': '2016-04-29', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_philosophy_of_science_very_short_introduction_page-1-15.json_chunk_7', 'course': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science'}, 'bm25_score': 3.3540291786193848, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 4.688903}, {'id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_on_(not)_defining_cognition.json_chunk_16', 'text': '. 2012 ). At the heart of the broad-tent approach to cognitive science that I espoused above is a commitment to letting the productivity of research programs in cognitive science guide the extension of language to new contexts. The slogan that “cognition is whatever cognitive scientists study” is partial and inadequate, however. Quite apart from its failure to recognize differences of opinion among cognitive scientists about what to study, it also suggests something too unidirectional in the relationship between science and philosophy, Historically and epistemically, science has been the dominant partner Synthese (2017) 194:4233–4249 4241 to philosophy of mind: driving perceived problems and theoretical innovations in the latter. But philosophical insight and creativity also can and does contribute to advances in science, and even philosophical skepticism about science has its place as a healthy counterweight to the naive acceptance of scientific pronouncements. Those who wish to extend the language of cognition to cover nonstandard cases may not owe a “story” about why it is appropriate and useful to do so—such practices will liveordieaccordingtotheirempiricalsuccessesorfailures.Nevertheless,theprovision ofsuchstorymayusefullygobeyondtheinterpretationofthetermsofatheoryormodel in specific experimental contexts, to link those theories and models to the phenomena motivating scientific enquiry in the first place ( Hartmann 1999 ). This means explaining how models and mechanisms of putatively cognitive capacities falling outside the traditional core of rational human judgment nevertheless connect to the phenomena motivating the investigation of cognition in the first place. Here, notions such as memory, problem solving and the like, play a dual role. They connect nonstandard cases, such as bee swarms, to the decision making that arises from interactions among neurons in the large-brained creatures more typically studied by psychologists', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'research_paper', 'title': 'On (not) defining cognition', 'author': 'Colin Allen', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\philosophy_of_cognitive_science\\pdf_material\\Allen-2017-On-not-defining-cognition.pdf', 'date_published': '2017-06-02', 'keywords': 'Cognition,Definition,Animals,Extended mind,Group cognition,Pluralism', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_on_(not)_defining_cognition.json_chunk_16', 'course': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science'}, 'bm25_score': 3.6095826625823975, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 4.632294}, {'id': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience_cognitive_computational_neuroscience.json_chunk_31', 'metadata': {'author': 'Nikolaus Kriegeskorte', 'chunk_id': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience_cognitive_computational_neuroscience.json_chunk_31', 'course': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience', 'date_published': '2018-08-27', 'document_type': 'research_paper', 'keywords': '', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Adv_cog_neuroscience\\pdf_material\\Kriegeskorte-2018-Cognitive-computational-neuroscienc.pdf', 'title': 'Cognitive computational neuroscience'}, 'text': '. At the level of theory, cognitive science challenges computational neuroscience to explain how the neurobiological dynamical components it studies contribute to cognition and behavior. Computational neuroscience needs AI, and in particular machine learning, to provide the theoretical and technological basis for modeling cognitive functions with biologically plausible dynamical components. Artificial intelligence needs cognitive science to guide the engineering of intelligence. Cognitive science’s tasks can serve as benchmarks for AI systems, building up from elementary cognitive abilities to artificial general intelligence. The literatures on human development and learning provide an essential guide to what is possible for a learner to achieve and what kinds of interaction with the world can support the acquisition of intelligence. AI needs computational neuroscience for algorithmic inspiration. Neural network models are an example of a brain-inspired technology that is unrivalled in several domains of AI. Taking further inspiration from the neurobiological dynamical components (for example, spiking neurons, dendritic dynamics, the canonical cortical microcircuit, oscillations, neuromodulatory processes) and the global functional layout of the human brain (for example, subsystems specialized for distinct functions, including sensory modalities, memory, planning and motor control) might lead to further AI breakthroughs. Machine learning draws from separate traditions in statistics and computer science, which have optimized statistical and computational efficiency, respectively. The integration of computational and statistical efficiency is an essential challenge in the age of big data. The brain appears to combine computational and statistical efficiency, and understanding its algorithm might boost machine learning. Looking ahead Bottom up and top down.

Graham Cognitive Science: Overview Cognitive science (CS) is a young discipline that emerged from a research program started in 1975. It partially overlaps with its mother disciplines: pschology, artificial intelligence, linguistics, philosophy, anthropology, and the neurosciences. By no means the only discipline dedicated to the study of cognition, cognitive science is unique in its basic tenet that cognitive processes are computations, a perspective which allows for direct comparison of natural and artificial intelligence, and emphasizes a methodology that integrates formal and empirical analyses with computational synthesis. Computer simulations as generative theories of cognition (see Cogniti e Modeling: Research Logic in Cogniti e Science ) have therefore become the hallmark of CS methodology. Today, CS is an internationally established field', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'research_paper', 'title': 'PII: B008043076701442X', 'author': 'Unknown', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\philosophy_of_cognitive_science\\pdf_material\\bechtel.cogscihistory.pdf', 'date_published': '2004-08-03', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_pii_b008043076701442x.json_chunk_14', 'course': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science'}, 'bm25_score': 3.396414279937744, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 4.103848}, {'id': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience_cognitive_computational_neuroscience.json_chunk_30', 'metadata': {'author': 'Nikolaus Kriegeskorte', 'chunk_id': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience_cognitive_computational_neuroscience.json_chunk_30', 'course': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience', 'date_published': '2018-08-27', 'document_type': 'research_paper', 'keywords': '', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Adv_cog_neuroscience\\pdf_material\\Kriegeskorte-2018-Cognitive-computational-neuroscienc.pdf', 'title': 'Cognitive computational neuroscience'}, 'text': '. Cognitive models, including the three classes highlighted here, decompose cognition into meaningful functional components. By declaring their models independent of the implementation in the brain, cognitive scientists are able to address high-level cognitive processes 21 , 97 , 98 that are beyond the reach of current neural networks. Cognitive models are essential for cognitive computational neurscience because they enable us to see the whole as we attempt to understand the roles of the parts. Box 4 | Why do cognitive science, computational neuroscience and AI need one another? Cognitive science needs computational neuroscience, not merely to explain the implementation of cognitive models in the brain, but also to discover the algorithms. For example, the dominant models of sensory processing and object recognition are brain-inspired neural networks, whose computations are not easily captured at a cognitive level. Recent successes with Bayesian nonparametric models do not yet in general scale to real-world cognition. Explaining the computational efficiency of human cognition and predicting detailed cognitive dynamics and behavior could benefit from studying brain-activity dynaics. Explaining behavior is essential, but behavioral data alone provide insufficient constraints for complex models. Brain data can provide rich constraints for cognitive algorithms if leveraged appropriately. Cognitive science has always progressed in close interaction with artificial intelligence. The disciplines share the goal of building task-performing models and thus rely on comon mathematical theory and programming environments. Computational neuroscience needs cognitive science to challenge it to engage higher-level cognition. At the experimental level, the tasks of cognitive science enable computational neuroscience to bring cognition into the lab. At the level of theory, cognitive science challenges computational neuroscience to explain how the neurobiological dynamical components it studies contribute to cognition and behavior', 'distance': 0.3300035893917084, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 4.008952}, {'id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_doi10.1016j.cub.2006.05.040.json_chunk_4', 'metadata': {'author': 'Unknown', 'chunk_id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_doi10.1016j.cub.2006.05.040.json_chunk_4', 'course': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science', 'date_published': '2006-06-14', 'document_type': 'research_paper', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\philosophy_of_cognitive_science\\pdf_material\\byrne_bates_why_are_animals_cognitive.pdf', 'title': 'doi:10.1016/j.cub.2006.05.040'}, 'text': '. This is where cognitive explanation comes in: cognition offers an interlingua between brain and behaviour [10] . Using the conceptual tools of cognitive science — theory of mind, working memory, focus of attention, cognitive map, number concept and counting, procedural knowledge, problem-solving, and many others — allows theories to be developed, simple enough to be comprehended and used to make testable predictions in natural environments, yet tight enough to be mapped precisely onto observed behaviour. (In principle, cognitive explanations can also be meshed with brain structures, but in animal work this is in practice more often a hope for the future, waiting for developments in imaging that can be used under relatively natural conditions.) An everyday analogy may be made with our understanding of how a television works. There is no doubt that its ‘behaviour’ — showing moving images of things happening at other places and times — is fundamentally caused by the electronics. However, handing us a full circuit diagram would seldom be educationally helpful. Rather, what is needed is an intervening level of explanation, in which it can be explained that images are sliced up, salami-fashion, then relayed as a linear signal, travelling neainstantaneously along wires as electric waves and across space as radio waves, finally rassembled by the electronics of the set. Only with the aid of this ‘cognitive model’ can one start to discuss intelligently the origin of that odd flicker or annoying stripe on the picture, and begin to decide whether it relates to characteristics of the set, the aerial, or the transmitter. The same applies in biology. For an animal as simple as the sea-slug Aplysia , with under 20,000 neurons, many of them very large, expecting to explain behaviour directly by tracing Figure 1', 'distance': 0.3336942195892334, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 3.6561003}, {'id': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience_cognitive_computational_neuroscience.json_chunk_2', 'text': '. We first briefly trace the steps of the cognitive and brain sciences and then review several exciting recent develoments that suggest that it might be possible to meet the combined ambitions of cognitive science (to explain how humans learn and think) 2 and computational neuroscience (to explain how brains adapt and compute) 3 using neurobiologically plausible artificial intelligence (AI) models. In the spirit of Newell’s critique, the transition from cognitive psychology to cognitive science was defined by the introduction of task-performing computational models. Cognitive scientists knew that understanding cognition required AI and brought engineering to cognitive studies. In the 1980s, cognitive science made impotant advances with symbolic cognitive architectures 4 , 5 and neural networks 6 , using human behavioral data to adjudicate between candidate computational models. However, computer hardware and machine learning were not sufficiently advanced to simulate cognitive processes in their full complexity. Moreover, these early developments relied on behavioral data alone and did not leverage constraints provided by the anatomy and activity of the brain. With the advent of human functional brain imaging, scientists began to relate cognitive theories to the human brain. This endeavor came to be called cognitive neuroscience 7 . Cognitive neuroscietists began by mapping cognitive psychology’s boxes (informatioprocessing modules) and arrows (interactions between modules) onto the brain. This was a step forward in terms of engaging brain activity, but a step back in terms of computational rigor. Methods for testing the task-performing computational models of cogntive science with brain-activity data had not been conceived. As a result, cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience parted ways in the 1990s', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'research_paper', 'title': 'Cognitive computational neuroscience', 'author': 'Nikolaus Kriegeskorte', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Adv_cog_neuroscience\\pdf_material\\Kriegeskorte-2018-Cognitive-computational-neuroscienc.pdf', 'date_published': '2018-08-27', 'keywords': '', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience_cognitive_computational_neuroscience.json_chunk_2', 'course': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience'}, 'bm25_score': 3.2479567527770996, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 3.5806205}, {'id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_on_(not)_defining_cognition.json_chunk_2', 'text': '. I will argue that the term “cognition” is at a level of description that is too general to be worth defining precisely or characterizing categorically. This view is sometimes assented to in vivo, B Colin Allen prof.colin.allen@gmail.com 1 Department of Philosophy, Xi’an Jiatong University, Xi’an, China 2 Department of History and Philosophy of Science, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA 3 Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Pittsburgh, 1017 Cathedral of Learning, 4200 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA 4234 Synthese (2017) 194:4233–4249 when philosophers of cognitive science meet face-to-face, but not fully represented in folio , where philosophers commit their arguments for all to read (but see Chemero 2009 , p. 201 n. 8 for a precedent). To define cognition has seemed important to philosophers for a number of reasons. These reasons have varying degrees of relevance to the topics taken up by cognitive scientists. For instance, one distinction that has exercised philosophers, particularly those bearing the burdens of epistemology, is that between perception and cognition. This empirical case for a separation of perception from cognition also remains a live issue (see, e.g., Firestone and Scholl 2015 ). But given that areas such as perceptual psychology and machine perception fall fully within the scope of cognitive science, it is not a distinction that affects the range of phenomena properly studied by cognitive scientists. While I would be equally critical of those seeking to expand the range of cognitive science by definitional fiat, my primary targets in this paper are those who insist on defining ‘cognition’ as part of a rearguard action against more expansive claims about the scope of cognitive science', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'research_paper', 'title': 'On (not) defining cognition', 'author': 'Colin Allen', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\philosophy_of_cognitive_science\\pdf_material\\Allen-2017-On-not-defining-cognition.pdf', 'date_published': '2017-06-02', 'keywords': 'Cognition,Definition,Animals,Extended mind,Group cognition,Pluralism', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_on_(not)_defining_cognition.json_chunk_2', 'course': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science'}, 'bm25_score': 3.1900930404663086, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 2.8284388}, {'id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_on_(not)_defining_cognition.json_chunk_10', 'text': '. Likewise, I maintain, cognitive scientists need neither an abstract definition of ‘cognition’ nor a theoretically pure conception of ‘cognitive system’. By pinning my critique on what is useful to cognitive science, it might be thought that I am giving up on doing philosophy for its own sake. All participants to this debate might be willing to concede the point that biologists and cognitive scientists do not need definitions of ‘life’ and ‘cognition’ in advance of their research. But Adams and others might suggest that when discussing extended cognition we are no longer 4238 Synthese (2017) 194:4233–4249 doing science but philosophy. For the sake of argument, I may accept that there are questions that philosophical reflection, and philosophical reflection alone, can answer. However, I maintain that the boundary between doing science and doing philosophy is not precise, and questions about extended cognition straddle the putative boundary. A further refinement of the suggestion might be that when discussing whether cognitive processes extend into the environment, we are no longer doing science but trying to identify the philosophical implications of certain scientific views—or, as argued by Aizawa ( 2015 ), we are concerned not with normal science but with revolutionary science. I agree that philosophical reflection is indispensable for investigating the philosophical implications of scientific findings or theories, and extraordinary science may deserve extraordinary attention to conceptual issues. Such work is also potentially valuable to practicing scientists insofar as it helps to clarify the commitments of the theories they are developing and to identify potential conflicts among theories', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'research_paper', 'title': 'On (not) defining cognition', 'author': 'Colin Allen', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\philosophy_of_cognitive_science\\pdf_material\\Allen-2017-On-not-defining-cognition.pdf', 'date_published': '2017-06-02', 'keywords': 'Cognition,Definition,Animals,Extended mind,Group cognition,Pluralism', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_on_(not)_defining_cognition.json_chunk_10', 'course': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science'}, 'bm25_score': 3.755838632583618, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 2.7079952}]"

(2) The brain is not a part of a human being but comparable to a tool This misconception was advanced by Harre ́ ( 2012 ), Searle ( 2007 ) and others. They argued that applying psychological predicates to the brain cannot be incoherent because the brain is not a part of a person. The brain is according to them a part of person’s body, and a person’s body is not part of that person in the relevant sense. Organs, according to the critics, are tools we use to manipulate things. The brain is a tool we use to perform psychological tasks, e.g. we use the hippocampus to remember. A Compilation for the Perplexed 1081 The idea that organs are tools is misguided (Hacker 2007 , 2013a ; Smit 2010a ). Organs are not tools: they are parts of an organism. Some organs have a function, like the kidney; other organs are used by us in order to fulfil a function, like the sense-organs (we see with our eyes and bring our eyes closer to what we want to examine) or hands (we use our hand to manipulate things). Some organs fulfil their functions independently of us: our stomach, liver, kidneys, and spleen are not subject to voluntary control. One cannot do anything with these organs. Other organs are under partial control, such as the bladder or the lungs, but only up to a point. The use of our limbs, however, is subject to voluntary control. We use our hands to touch, to feel, to pick things up or move them, to manipulate things. The essential point to note here is that, in contrast to what the critics believe, we do not use our brain as we use our hands. The brain is not an organ with which we can do anything, though we cannot do anything without out brain (see further Sect. 4 ). For example we cannot walk unless the motor cortex is functioning normally, but that does not mean that we walk with our brain. Some evolutionary theorists argue that organs are tools because they are designed. The reason is that they believe that Darwin replaced Paley’s argument from design by natural selection (see for example Williams 1966 [1992])', 'distance': 0.3578447997570038, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': -2.405771}, {'id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_churchland_1990-could-a-machine-think.json_chunk_18', 'metadata': {'author': 'Unknown', 'chunk_id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_churchland_1990-could-a-machine-think.json_chunk_18', 'course': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science', 'date_published': '2020-05-09', 'document_type': 'research_paper', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\philosophy_of_cognitive_science\\pdf_material\\churchland_1990-Could-A-Machine-Think.pdf', 'title': 'churchland_1990-Could-A-Machine-Think'}, 'text': '. Brains are computers in a radically different style. How the brain manages meaning is still unknown, but it is clear that the problem reaches beyond language use and beyond humans.

Searle appears to agree, although he qualifies his claim by saying that ""any other system capable of causing minds would have to have causal pow\xad ers (at least) equivalent to those of brains."" We close by addressing this claim. We presume that Searle is not claiming that a successful artificial mind must have all the causal pow\xad ers of the brain, such as the power to smell bad when rotting, to harbor slow viruses such as kuru, to stain yellow with horseradish peroxidase and so forth. Requiring perfect parity would be like requiring that an artificial fly\xad ing device lay eggs. Presumably he means only to re\xad quire of an artificial mind all of the causal powers relevant, as he says, to conscious intelligence. But which ex\xad actly are they?

Computers do not and cannot. (6) The limiting case of a brain in a vat shows that brains can think It has been argued by Dainton ( 2007 ) that the brain may be a limiting case of a mutilated human being and is therefore capable of thinking, etc. Yet a brain in a vat A Compilation for the Perplexed 1085 is neither a pickled human being nor a mutilated human corpse. The intelligibility of exhibiting cognitive powers by the exercise of prostheses does not show that the possessor of cognitive capacities is the brain. One can imagine, in science fiction, that a living brain might be linked to prosthetic eyes and ears, mechanical limbs and a computerized voice box. Then, so the story may run, the voice and limbs may exhibit thought and volition. Does this not show that the brain (and not the living human being) is the subject that thinks and wills? No. What it shows is that this imaginary being, which Bennett and Hacker ( 2008 ) dubbed a cerebroid , does so. We need a brain in order to be able to think (walk and talk), just as a jet aeroplane needs engines in order to fly. But aircraft engines cannot fly any more than brains can think (walk or talk). It is human beings, who have brains, that think—not their brains, which neither have brains (since they are brains) nor minds (there is no such thing as a thought’s crossing the brain’s mind) or bodies (someone may have a beautiful body, but their brain cannot be said to have a beautiful body). The brain is no more a limiting case of a mutilated human being than an aircraft engine is a limiting case of a damaged aeroplane. Although one’s cognitive powers normally depend on a body for their expression, an artificial vehicle may, in certain respects, do just as well. For example, a prosthetic hand may be used to gesture in the same way as a real hand, or a speech synthesizer to speak as a real voice. That a prosthesis is quite unlike real flesh, and an electronic voice quite unlike a real voice need not materially affect the subject’s ability to gesture or speak', 'distance': 0.34027114510536194, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': -2.8411393}]"

Nucleus A clearly distinguishable mass of neurons, usually deep in the brain (not to be confused with the nucleus of a cell). Nucleus is from the Latin word for “nut.” Example: lateral geniculate nucleus , a cell group in the brain stem that relays information from the eye to the cerebral cortex. Substantia A group of related neurons deep within the brain but usually with less distinct borders than those of nuclei. Example: substantia nigra (from the Latin for “black substance”), a brain stem cell group involved in the control of voluntary movement. Locus (plural: loci) A small, well-defi ned group of cells. Example: locus coeruleus (Latin for “blue spot”), a brain stem cell group involved in the control of wakefulness and behavioral arousal. Ganglion (plural: ganglia) A collection of neurons in the PNS. Ganglion is from the Greek for “knot.” Example: the dorsal root ganglia , which contain the cell bodies of sensory axons entering the spinal cord via the dorsal roots. Only one cell group in the CNS goes by this name: the basal ganglia , which are structures lying deep within the cerebrum that control movement. Na Na me me De De sc sc ri ri pt pt io io n an an d Ex Ex am am pl pl e TABLE 7.2 Collections of Axons Name Description and Example Nerve A bundle of axons in the PNS. Only one collection of CNS axons is called a nerve: the optic nerve . White matter A generic term for a collection of CNS axons. When a freshly dissected brain is cut open, axons appear white. Tract A collection of CNS axons having a common site of origin and a common destination. Example: corticospinal tract, which originates in the cerebral cortex and ends in the spinal cord', 'distance': 0.30833399295806885, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': -1.6617758}, {'id': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience_bear_2016_neuroscience_exploring_the_brain_page-551-578.json_chunk_21', 'text': '. The stomach wall is richly innervated by mechanosensory axons, and most of these ascend to the brain via the vagus nerve . Recall from the appendix to Chapter 7 that the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) contains a mixture of sensory and motor axons, originates in the medulla, and meanders through much of the body cavity ( vagus is from the Latin for “wandering”). The vagal sensory axons activate neurons in the ncleus of the solitary tract in the medulla. These signals inhibit feeding behavior. You may recall that the nucleus of the solitary tract has been metioned several times in different contexts. The gustatory nucleus, which receives direct sensory input from the taste buds (see Chapter 8), is actally a subdivision of the nucleus of the solitary tract. The nucleus of the solitary tract is also an important center in the control of the ANS (see Chapter 15). Now we fi nd that the same nucleus receives visceral sesory input from the vagus nerve. It is easy to see how a nucleus with such widespread connections could serve as an important integration center in the control of feeding and metabolism. As you know, satiety induced by a full stomach can be delayed quite a while if what you are eating is tasty enough. Cholecystokinin. In the 1970s, researchers discovered that the adminitration of the peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) inhibits meal frequency and size. CCK is present in some of the cells that line the intestines and some of the neurons of the enteric nervous system. It is released in rsponse to stimulation of the intestines by certain types of food, especially fatty ones. The major action of CCK as a satiety peptide is exerted on the vagal sensory axons. CCK acts synergistically with gastric distension to inhibit feeding behavior (Figure 16.13). Curiously, CCK, like many other gastrointestinal peptides, is also contained within selected populations of neurons within the central nervous system (CNS).

Yes, this is an explicit performative, since, if I say “I pose an answer,” I thereby pose an answer, whether or not it is a good answer. 2. Typically, one asks “Why should the system change?” when one thinks that it should remain the same unless there are strong reasons to change, whereas one asks “Why not?” when one thinks that it should change unless there are strong reasons to remain the same. Shifting the question, thus, shifts the burden of proof. 3.

My answer is that many people have stopped giving reasons of their own and looking for reasons for opposing positions. Even when they give and are given reasons, they do so in a biased and uncritical way, so they fail to understand the reasons on each side of the issue. These people claim too often that their stance is so obvious that anyone who knows what they are talking about will agree with them. If so, opponents must not know what they are talking about. Even before their opponents start talking, these people feel confident that those on the opposing side must all be deeply confused or misinformed or even crazy. They disparage their opponents as so silly that they cannot have any reason at all on their side.

By inserting the continuers mh hm and sh::: while A’s turn was still underway, according to Schegloff, B was showing, first, that she was paying attention and realized that A was in the middle of an extended unit of talk. At the same time, she was explicitly signaling that she was passing up the opportunity to initiate a repair on the turn so far and, by implication, that she understood the turn so far. With the second Mh hm ::, for example, she was claiming to understand the phrase t’the governor and, therefore, the definite reference it contained. The same holds for the other definite references. B may even be intended to interrupt A as soon as she believes she has identified the referent, as in this example (from Sacks, quoted by Jefferson, 1973, p. 59): A. I heard you were at the beach yesterday. What’s her name, oh you know, the tall redhead that lives across the street from Larry? The one who drove him to work the day his car I/ waB. Oh Gina! A. Yeah Gina. She said she saw you at the beach yesterday. A indicated he would go on until B identified the referent. Indeed, he stopped at B’s interruption and completed the process by confirming B’s identification with Yeah Gina. Taken together, this evidence suggests that A and B accept mutual resposibility for each definite reference.

G.6 R EADING C OMPREHENSION WITH C OMMONSENSE I NPUT Complete the passage. (CNN) – At first glance, ""The Flat"" might seem like an episode of ""Hoarders,"" Israeli-style. The documentary film opens after an elderly woman dies in Tel Aviv. Her grandchildren assemble to clean out her apartment, packed with dusty books, vintage clothing (dozens of pairs of fancy gloves, for instance), enough purses to stock a department store, jewelry, mementoes and closets full of knickknacks. But buried among the detritus they chance upon something remarkable – mysterious papers linking the grandparents to an important Nazi figure. How could such ardent Zionists, who left their native Germany in the early 1930s, have been involved with an SS official like Leopold von Mildenstein? What I found out was this journey, the Nazi ( OPTIONS: - Arnon Goldfinger) and his wife were accompanied by my grandparents,"" Goldfinger told CNN. - CNN) and his wife were accompanied by my grandparents,"" Goldfinger told CNN. - Germany) and his wife were accompanied by my grandparents,"" Goldfinger told CNN. - Israeli) and his wife were accompanied by my grandparents,"" Goldfinger told CNN. - Leopold von Mildenstein) and his wife were accompanied by my grandparents,"" Goldfinger told CNN', 'distance': 0.38659390807151794, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': -5.488902}, {'id': 'cognition_and_communication_pii_0010-0277(86)90010-7.json_chunk_10', 'metadata': {'author': 'Unknown', 'chunk_id': 'cognition_and_communication_pii_0010-0277(86)90010-7.json_chunk_10', 'course': 'cognition_and_communication', 'date_published': '2003-09-24', 'document_type': 'research_paper', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\cognition_and_communication\\pdf_material\\Clark, H.H. _ Wilkes-Gibbs, D. _Referring as a collaborative process_ 1986.pdf', 'title': 'PII: 0010-0277(86)90010-7'}, 'text': '. The evidence is clearest when B believes she may not have identified A’s referent and attempts to repair the problem, as in our earlier example: B. Tioh yih mean like a week f’m tomorrow. A. Yah. These turns constitute a side sequence, a block of exchanges embedded within or between anticipated contributions to the conversation (Jefferson, 1972; Schegloff, 1972). So although the side sequence was initiated by B, it was completed by A before the conversation was allowed to proceed. That was needed for them to mutually believe that B had now understood A’s reference correctly. More often, A and B have to establish that B has understood the reference, and for this, B can use a simple expedient: allowing the next contribution to continue. Suppose the conversation had continued this way: B. How long y’gonna be here? A. Unot too long. Uh just til uh Monday. B. Oh that’s too bad. By asserting Oh that’s too bad, B would be passing up the opportunity to correct a possible misunderstanding and would thereby be implicating that she understood A’s reference. “Regularly, then,” as Sacks et al. (1974, p. 728) put it, “a turn’s talk will display its speaker’s understanding of a prior turn’s talk, and whatever other talk it marks itself as directed to” (see also Goffman, 1976). Note that going on wouldn’t necessarily mean B had truly 8 H.H. Clark and D. Wilkes-Gibbs understood. She might not recognize her misunderstanding, or she might want to claim she had understood when she hadn’t. But in either case, going on is a signal that B believes she has understood. In the first case she is making a mistake; in the second she is using the signal to deceive. The same mutual belief can be established more directly by what Schegloff (1981) has called CoIztinuers, as in his example from a radio call-in show (p. 80): A. B. A. B. A. B. A. B.

If an infant had still not made a choice after the third prompt, the experimenter repeated the choice procedure up to three times (on average, infants received 2.7 of the 9 possible prompts; SI Appendix ). If an infant reached for both puppets at the same time, the choice was coded as both and was not included in the analysis. If an infant failed to reach for either puppet after three attempts, the choice was coded as none. This procedure and these crteria for exclusion were preregistered. At the end of the study, parents were invited to ask questions and were given the opportunity to view the stimuli. Coding, stopping rule, and analyses.

We took advantage of infants ’ tendency to look toward a visual event that is the inferred source of an accompanying sound (32 – 35). After following the same procedure as in study 1, the reaching trial was replaced by a speaking trial; the two puppets from the previous interactions, side by side, moved their mouths in synchrony while a single voice, speaking with high and exaggerated pitch, addressed the infant by name (e.g., “ Hi, Ashley! Hi! ” ). Infants recognize their own name by 4 mo of age (36, 37), and people who know one another ’ s names are more likely to be social partners. We asked whether infants would infer that the voice calling to them by name came from the puppet imitated by their parent and therfore would look to that puppet in anticipation of future comunicative behavior. We preregistered the prediction of longer looking to the parent-imitated puppet on this trial but not in the visual preference trial ( SI Appendix for discussion). In study 2 (preregistered: https://osf.io/pbfzv ), infants ( n = 18, aged 11 mo, 15 d to 12 mo, 15 d) looked toward the puppet whom their own parent had imitated during the speaking trial ( M = 0.620, SD = 0.183, BF 10 = 8.843). This pattern selectively followed their own parent ’ s social behavior; after seeing a diffeent infant ’ s parent imitate one of two puppets, infants did not look at the imitated puppet during the speaking trial ( M = 0.485, SD = 0.140, BF 01 = 1.264; difference between the own parent and other parent yoked control condition, BF 10 = 17.527). Infants also did not look more toward the imtated puppet in the silent visual preference trial, either after watcing their own parent ( M = 0.529, SD = 0.101, BF 01 = 2.25) or after watching the unfamiliar parent ( M = 0.484, SD = 0.133, BF 01 = 3.70; Fig. 2 B ).

Average predictive difference in probability of switching, comparing households with existing arsenic levels of 0.5 and 1.0. We can similarly compute the predictive difference, and average predictive difference, comparing households at two different arsenic levels, assuming equality in distance to nearest safe well and education levels. We choose arsen ic = 0.5 and 1.0 as comparison points because 0.5 is the lowest unsafe level, 1.0 is twice that, and this comparison captures much o ' the range of the data (see Figure 5.10 on page 90).

I do not want to meet with you; you do not want to deal with me. I refuse to compromise; so do you. Neither of us is open to any possibility of cooperation. No progress is made. My answer is that many people have stopped giving reasons of their own and looking for reasons for opposing positions. Even when they give and are given reasons, they do so in a biased and uncritical way, so they fail to understand the reasons on each side of the issue. These people claim too often that their stance is so obvious that anyone who knows what they are talking about will agree with them. If so, opponents must not know what they are talking about. Even before their opponents start talking, these people feel confident that those on the opposing side must all be deeply confused or misinformed or even crazy. They disparage their opponents as so silly that they cannot have any reason at all on their side. Then they cynically assume that reasoning won’t do any good anyway, because their opponents are driven only by emotions – fear, anger, hatred, greed or blind compassion – and do not care about truth or about the same values that matter to them. As a result, elections are decided by who gets out the most voters and perhaps by who creates the most rousing or humorous advertisements and slogans instead of by who gives the strongest reasons for their policies. This strategy cannot help us climb out of our rut. We need to state and understand arguments on both sides. We need to offer our reasons to our opponents and demand reasons from them.

If it were, then we could figure out which claim is the premise and which is the conclusion; but there is no premise or conclusion in ‘so shall it be for now’. Another indication is that we cannot substitute a different argument marker; it makes no sense to say, ‘and therefore shall it be for now’. Instead, what this clause means is simply ‘that is the way it will be for now’. An argument can be given without any argument markers at all. Sometimes the argument marker is assumed rather than asserted. Indeed, sometimes even the conclusion is not stated openly but only suggested. For example, South Korean President Park Geun-hye was criticized for obtaining cosmetic Botox injections. One of her supporters, Kim Ku-ja, replied, ‘What’s so wrong about a woman getting Botox shots? Why is that a problem?’ 6 Kim Ku-ja’s rhetorical questions clearly suggest that she believes that there is nothing wrong at all and there is no problem with receiving Botox injections. She suggests this argument: ‘There is nothing wrong with getting Botox shots. People should not criticize anyone for doing what is not wrong. So, people should not criticize Park Geun-hye for getting Botox shots.’ Nonetheless, Kim Ku-ja does not actually assert any premise or conclusion. She only asks questions, and questions cannot be premises or conclusions in arguments (since they are not declarative). Hence, Kim Ku-ja does not actually assert any argument – she only indirectly suggests one. Implied arguments like this demonstrate why we need to be careful in thinking about whether a speaker is offering an argument and also about what argument they are giving. Our definition can guide this investigation by leading us to ask whether the speakers intend to present any kind of reason, but the answer will remain unclear in some cases. When we are not sure whether a speaker intends to offer an argument, we can still ask what the argument would be and whether it would be any good. After all, what matters is whether there is a reason for the conclusion', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'research_paper', 'title': 'Think Again', 'author': 'Walter Sinnott-Armstrong', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\philosophy_of_cognitive_science\\pdf_material\\sinnott-armstrong_2018_Think Again How to Reason and Argue.pdf', 'date_published': '2019-05-15', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_think_again.json_chunk_60', 'course': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science'}, 'bm25_score': 2.9093286991119385, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': -2.5662944}, {'id': 'perception_and_action_introduction_to_ecological_psychology;_a_lawful_approach_to_perceiving,_acting,_and_cognizing_page-73-105.json_chunk_48', 'text': '. Now imagine standing directly between the two people who are having a catch (by throwing the ball over your head to each other), facing one of them, and looking up. 102 Reconceptualizing Old Problems What will the path of the ball look like now? You are now under the curved path of the ball, so it will not look like this ∩ anymore. Instead, you will see the ball travel a straight-line path. So following Rule 1 will put you in the path of the moving ball. However, in your current position between the two people having a catch, you are still not in position to catch the ball. But you are aligned with the path of the ball. You will see the ball travel a straight-line path and keep going over your head . Now imagine backing up way too far to a spot behind where the ball will land. You will now see the ball stop moving along the straight-line path before it is over your head as it begins to descend in front of you. Now imagine moving forward until you are exactly where the ball will land. What will the path of the ball look like now? You will see the ball travel a straight-line path until it is directly over your head . At this point, the ball will appear to stop moving along this path (because it is now falling straight down directly to where you are standing). You will then see the optical texture of the ball expand symmetrically, occluding what is behind it (see Figure 6.9b). Following Rule 2 will put you in the location along the ball’s path where it will land when it lands there. It will put you in the right place at the right time (Turvey, 2019) Researchers investigated this by attaching a small video camera to a person’s shoulder (this was in the mid-1990s before GoPros and other more convenient options were available). They then launched balls toward the person from a distance of 50 m (about 164 feet) and used the video from the camera to analyze what the person saw when they were moving into position to catch the ball', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Introduction to Ecological Psychology; A Lawful Approach to Perceiving, Acting, and Cognizing', 'author': 'Julia J.

The traceplot shows clearly that the posterior has at least two modes, though rerunning the model might sometimes reveal three modes. What should we do now? It can be a good idea to back off and simplify the model. Once the simplified model converges, we can think about adding further complexity. The verbal description of our model says that the accuracy in the task-engaged mode should be close to 100%. To simplify the model, we’ll assume that it’s exactly 100%. This entails the following: \\[\\begin{equation} p_{correct} = 1 \\end{equation}\\] We adapt our Stan code inmixture_h2.stan, reflecting the assumption thatp_correcthas a fixed value; this parameter is now in a block calledtransformed data. There, we assign top_correctthe value of1. Fit the model again to the same data: The model has now converged: The traceplots in Figure17.15show that this times the chains are mixing well. FIGURE 17.15: Traceplots from the simplified hierarchical model (mixture_h2.stan, assuming thatp_correct = 1) fit to (a subset) of the real data. The traceplot shows that chains are mixing well.

Under the assumptions that we have made(e.g., that there are two processing modes, response times are affected by the difficulty of the task in the task-engaged mode, accuracy is not affected by the difficulty of the task and is perfect at the task-engaged mode, etc.), we can look at the parameters and conclude the following: If we want to know whether our model achieves descriptive adequacy, we need to look at the posterior predictive distributions of the model.

Average predictive difference in probability of switching, comparing households with existing arsenic levels of 0.5 and 1.0. We can similarly compute the predictive difference, and average predictive difference, comparing households at two different arsenic levels, assuming equality in distance to nearest safe well and education levels. We choose arsen ic = 0.5 and 1.0 as comparison points because 0.5 is the lowest unsafe level, 1.0 is twice that, and this comparison captures much o ' the range of the data (see Figure 5.10 on page 90).

The “multilevel” part of the model involves assigning a multivariate distribution to the vector of /3’s within each group, as we discuss in Section 13.1. FIVE WAYS TO W RITE THE SAME MODEL 263 For now we will focus on varying-intercept models , in which the only coefficient that varies across groups is the constant term /?o (which, to minimize subscripting, we label a). For the radon data that include the floor and a county-level uranium predictor, the model then becomes Hi — <Xj[i] + Pi Xu + P2X12 + €i where Xu is the ith element of the vector X ^ representing the first-floor indicators and Xi 2 is the zth element of the vector X( 2 ) representing the uranium measurement in the county containing house i. We can also write this in matrix notation as Vi = OLj [¿] + X i P + a with the understanding that X includes the first-floor indicator and the county uranium measurement but not the constant term. This is the way that models are built using ImerO, including all predictors at the individual level, as we discuss in Section 12.6. The second level of the model is simply a j ~ N(/za ,<T^). (12.5) Group-level errors. The model (12.5) can also be written as a j = fia + r)j, with Tjj ~ N( 0 ,er£). (12.6) The group-level errors r\\j can be helpful in understanding the model; however, we often use the more compact notation (12.5) to reduce the profusion of notation. (We have also toyed with notation such as a j = fia + e? in which e is consistently used for regression errors—but the superscripts seem too confusing. As illustrated in Part 2B of this book, we sometimes use such notation when programming models in Bugs.) Combining separate local regressions An alternative way to write the multilevel model is as a linking of local regressions in each group. Within each group j , a regression is performed on the local predictors (in this case, simply the first-floor indicator, a^), with a constant term a that is indexed by group: within county j : yi N (aj + Pxi,(jy), for i = 1 ,,rij', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models', 'author': 'Andrew Gelman', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\Methods_3\\pdf_material\\Data Analysis Using Regression and MultilevelHierarchical Models.pdf', 'date_published': '2018-03-02', 'keywords': 'statistics, data, analysis, multilevel, hierarchical, modelling, regression', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Methods_3_data_analysis_using_regression_and_multilevelhierarchical_models_page-237-278.json_chunk_39', 'course': 'Methods_3'}, 'bm25_score': 2.5108113288879395, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': -1.5445554}, {'id': 'cognition_and_communication_infants_infer_potential_social_partners_by_observing_the_interactions_of_their_parent_with_unknown_others.json_chunk_8', 'text': '. We took advantage of infants ’ tendency to look toward a visual event that is the inferred source of an accompanying sound (32 – 35). After following the same procedure as in study 1, the reaching trial was replaced by a speaking trial; the two puppets from the previous interactions, side by side, moved their mouths in synchrony while a single voice, speaking with high and exaggerated pitch, addressed the infant by name (e.g., “ Hi, Ashley! Hi! ” ). Infants recognize their own name by 4 mo of age (36, 37), and people who know one another ’ s names are more likely to be social partners. We asked whether infants would infer that the voice calling to them by name came from the puppet imitated by their parent and therfore would look to that puppet in anticipation of future comunicative behavior. We preregistered the prediction of longer looking to the parent-imitated puppet on this trial but not in the visual preference trial ( SI Appendix for discussion). In study 2 (preregistered: https://osf.io/pbfzv ), infants ( n = 18, aged 11 mo, 15 d to 12 mo, 15 d) looked toward the puppet whom their own parent had imitated during the speaking trial ( M = 0.620, SD = 0.183, BF 10 = 8.843). This pattern selectively followed their own parent ’ s social behavior; after seeing a diffeent infant ’ s parent imitate one of two puppets, infants did not look at the imitated puppet during the speaking trial ( M = 0.485, SD = 0.140, BF 01 = 1.264; difference between the own parent and other parent yoked control condition, BF 10 = 17.527).

what is cognitive modelling?,"Cognitive modeling refers to the process of creating formal representations or models of cognitive processes, such as perception, attention, memory, learning, and decision-making, that simulate human behavior. These models aim to capture the underlying mechanisms and principles that govern human cognition, often by drawing on insights from psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and computer science ([1], [2]).

Cognitive modeling involves developing mathematical or computational representations of cognitive processes, which can then be used to test hypotheses, predict behaviors, and inform theories about human cognition. This approach is essential in understanding complex cognitive phenomena, as it allows researchers to manipulate variables, control for confounding factors, and identify causal relationships that may not be observable through empirical studies alone ([3]).

In the context of cognitive science, cognitive modeling is a key methodology for developing and testing theories about how we process information, make decisions, and behave.

This might be very useful in the experimental setup, and crucial in more observational setups. Cognitive modeling also allows us to discriminate between different cognitive components more difficult to assess by looking at performance only. For instance, why are participants performing less optimally when facing a supposedly non-intentional agent? Is their learning rate different? Is their estimate of volatility different? In other setups, e.g. a gambling context, we might observe that some participants (e.g. parkinson’s patients) are gambling away much.

Cognitive models, including the three classes highlighted here, decompose cognition into meaningful functional components. By declaring their models independent of the implementation in the brain, cognitive scientists are able to address high-level cognitive processes 21 , 97 , 98 that are beyond the reach of current neural networks. Cognitive models are essential for cognitive computational neurscience because they enable us to see the whole as we attempt to understand the roles of the parts. Box 4 | Why do cognitive science, computational neuroscience and AI need one another? Cognitive science needs computational neuroscience, not merely to explain the implementation of cognitive models in the brain, but also to discover the algorithms. For example, the dominant models of sensory processing and object recognition are brain-inspired neural networks, whose computations are not easily captured at a cognitive level. Recent successes with Bayesian nonparametric models do not yet in general scale to real-world cognition. Explaining the computational efficiency of human cognition and predicting detailed cognitive dynamics and behavior could benefit from studying brain-activity dynaics. Explaining behavior is essential, but behavioral data alone provide insufficient constraints for complex models. Brain data can provide rich constraints for cognitive algorithms if leveraged appropriately. Cognitive science has always progressed in close interaction with artificial intelligence. The disciplines share the goal of building task-performing models and thus rely on comon mathematical theory and programming environments. Computational neuroscience needs cognitive science to challenge it to engage higher-level cognition. At the experimental level, the tasks of cognitive science enable computational neuroscience to bring cognition into the lab. At the level of theory, cognitive science challenges computational neuroscience to explain how the neurobiological dynamical components it studies contribute to cognition and behavior', 'distance': 0.2901713252067566, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 4.6075535}, {'id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_doi10.1016j.cub.2006.05.040.json_chunk_4', 'metadata': {'author': 'Unknown', 'chunk_id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_doi10.1016j.cub.2006.05.040.json_chunk_4', 'course': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science', 'date_published': '2006-06-14', 'document_type': 'research_paper', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\philosophy_of_cognitive_science\\pdf_material\\byrne_bates_why_are_animals_cognitive.pdf', 'title': 'doi:10.1016/j.cub.2006.05.040'}, 'text': '. This is where cognitive explanation comes in: cognition offers an interlingua between brain and behaviour [10] . Using the conceptual tools of cognitive science — theory of mind, working memory, focus of attention, cognitive map, number concept and counting, procedural knowledge, problem-solving, and many others — allows theories to be developed, simple enough to be comprehended and used to make testable predictions in natural environments, yet tight enough to be mapped precisely onto observed behaviour. (In principle, cognitive explanations can also be meshed with brain structures, but in animal work this is in practice more often a hope for the future, waiting for developments in imaging that can be used under relatively natural conditions.) An everyday analogy may be made with our understanding of how a television works. There is no doubt that its ‘behaviour’ — showing moving images of things happening at other places and times — is fundamentally caused by the electronics. However, handing us a full circuit diagram would seldom be educationally helpful. Rather, what is needed is an intervening level of explanation, in which it can be explained that images are sliced up, salami-fashion, then relayed as a linear signal, travelling neainstantaneously along wires as electric waves and across space as radio waves, finally rassembled by the electronics of the set. Only with the aid of this ‘cognitive model’ can one start to discuss intelligently the origin of that odd flicker or annoying stripe on the picture, and begin to decide whether it relates to characteristics of the set, the aerial, or the transmitter. The same applies in biology.

First, we show that computtional modeling is essential to ensure progress in cognitive science. Second, we provide an introduction to the abstract idea of modeling and its many and varied applications. Third, we survey some of the issues involved in the interpretation of model output, including in particular how models can help constrain scientists’ own thinking. 1.1 Models and Theories in Science Cognitive scientists seek to understand how the mind works. That is, we want to describe and predict people’s behavior, and we ultimately wish to explain it, in the same way that physicists predict the motion of an apple that is dislodged from its tree (and can accrately describe its downward path) and explain its trajectory (by appealing to gravity). For example, if you forget someone’s name when you are distracted seconds after being introduced to her, we would like to know what cognitive process is responsible for this failure. Was it lack of attention? Forgetting over time? Can we know ahead of time whether or not you will remember that person’s name? The central thesis of this book is that to answer questions such as these, cognitive scientists must rely on quantitative mathematical models, just like physicists who research gravity. We suggest that to expand our knowledge of the human mind, consideration of the data and verbal theorizing are insufficient on their own. This thesis is best illustrated by considering something that is (just a little) simpler and more readily understood than the mind. Have a look at the data shown in Figure 1.1, which represent the position of planets in the night sky over time', 'distance': 0.2633715569972992, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 2.1655283}, {'id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_on_(not)_defining_cognition.json_chunk_12', 'metadata': {'author': 'Colin Allen', 'chunk_id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_on_(not)_defining_cognition.json_chunk_12', 'course': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science', 'date_published': '2017-06-02', 'document_type': 'research_paper', 'keywords': 'Cognition,Definition,Animals,Extended mind,Group cognition,Pluralism', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\philosophy_of_cognitive_science\\pdf_material\\Allen-2017-On-not-defining-cognition.pdf', 'title': 'On (not) defining cognition'}, 'text': '. Such general modeling efforts do not, however, proceed by first using a general concept of cognition to determine what should or should not be included in the model. Rather, they attempt to combine elements of other theories and models into an architecture that can solve more complex and realistic tasks. For example, John Anderson’s seminal work in this area extends theories of problem solving (esp. Newell and Simon 1972 ) with ideas from learning theory, by treating production rules as the targets of a basic learning mechanism ( Anderson 1983 , 1993 ). In the context of such general models, the notion of cognition is not prcisely defined, although general characterization of a cognitive system is sometimes attempted. For example, Simon and Newell ( 1970 ) describe human thinking as an information-processing system, but they note that details of the system are “elusive” ( 1970 , p. 149) because of its adaptive nature. If “adaptive information processing” is Synthese (2017) 194:4233–4249 4239 a reasonable working definition of cognition—a definition suitable, that is, for oriening newcomers to phenomena of potential interest—it is inadequate for the kind of ontological purposes that have driven philosophers to seek the mark of the cognitive. This is because the key notions of adaptiveness and information are no less a source of ambiguity or controversy than ‘cognition’. One might, for example, raise questions about the timescale over which a cognitive system should manifest adaptive procesing: momentary, lifetime, multigenerational, or evolutionary? This issue is entirely germane to the question of whether plants engage in adaptive information processing, since their responses to changes in environmental conditions tend to happen much more slowly than those of animals. The notion of information proves just as prolematic', 'distance': 0.31761717796325684, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 1.7354808}, {'id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_cognitive_psychology_history.json_chunk_12', 'text': '. The movment continues to be in fl uential and increasingly focuses on computational models of cognition. What has changed since its inception in the 1970s is the kind of computational model in favor. Newer Directions: Connectionism and Cognitive Neuroscience Connectionist Modeling The computer models that dominated cognitive psychology from its inception used complex symbols as representations, and processed these representations in a rule-based fashion (e.g., in a model of object recognition, the representation for a frog might consist of a conjunction of complex properties, and the rule for recognition might look something like ‘ If it ’ s green, small, and croaks, it ’ s a frog ’ ). Starting in the early 1980s, an alternative kind of cognitive model started to attract interest, namely ‘ connectionist ’ (or ‘ parallel distributed processing ’ ) models. These proposals have the form of neural networks, consisting of nodes (representations) that are densely inteconnected, with the connections varying in strength (see the bottom of Figure 1 ). In 1981 Hinton and Anderson published a book surveying then existent connectionist models ( Hinton and Anderson, 1981 ), and in the same year McClelland and Rumelhart (1981) presented a connectionist model of word recognition that explained a wide variety of experimental results. The fl oodgates had been opened, and connectionist models of perception, memory, and language proliferated, to the point where they now dominate computational approaches to cognition. Why the great appeal? One frequently cited reason is neurological plausibility : the models are clearly closer to brain function than are traditional rule-based models. A second reason is that connectionist models permit parallel constraint satisfaction : different sources of activation can converge simutaneously on the same representations or response', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'research_paper', 'title': 'Cognitive Psychology: History', 'author': 'Edward E.

It will also prepare students to use theories from cognitive science in the development of software agents capable of performing simple cognitive tasks (i.e. artificial intelligence systems). The course includes 1) an introduction to general frameworks for formalising cognitive theories, including specific mathematical models; and 2) the application of advanced statistical methods for evaluating formal models of cognition, and for applying models to data. This course integrates conceptual and theoretical knowledge about cognitive functions with 1) formal modelling tools, and 2) statistical methods for fitting theory to data.

This development has resulted from the realization that across a wide variety of tasks the fundamental problem the cognitive system confronts is coping with uncertainty. From visual scene recognition to on-line language comprehension, from categorizing stimuli to determining to what degree an argument is convincing, people must deal with the incompleteness of the information they possess to perform these tasks, many of which have important survival-related consequences. This paper provides a review of Bayesian models of cognition, dividing them up by the different aspects of cognition to which they have been applied. The paper begins with a brief review of Bayesian inference. This falls short of a full technical introduction but the reader is referred to the relevant literature for further details. There follows reviews of Bayesian models in Perception, Categorization, Learning and Causality, Language Processing, Inductive Reasoning, Deductive Reasoning, and Argumentation. In all these areas, it is argued that sophisticated Bayesian models are enhancing our understanding of the underlying cognitive computations involved. It is concluded that a major challenge is to extend the evidential basis for these models, especially to accounts of higher level cognition. \uf6d9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We average the predictive differences over the n households in the data to obtain: average predictive difference: _1 n n ^ 8 (arsenic*, educ4* ). 2=1 (5.7) In R: R code b <- coef (fit.10) hi <- 1 lo <- 0 delta <- invlogit (b [1] + b[2]*hi + b [3] *arsenic + b[4]*educ4) - invlogit (b [1] + b[2]*lo + b [3] * arsenic + b[4]*educ4) print (me an (delta)) The result is —0.20, implying that, on average in the data, households that are 100 meters from the nearest safe well are 20% less likely to switch, compared to househoulds that are right next to the nearest safe well, at the same arsenic and education levels. Average predictive difference in probability of switching, comparing households with existing arsenic levels of 0.5 and 1.0. We can similarly compute the predictive difference, and average predictive difference, comparing households at two different arsenic levels, assuming equality in distance to nearest safe well and education levels. We choose arsen ic = 0.5 and 1.0 as comparison points because 0.5 is the lowest unsafe level, 1.0 is twice that, and this comparison captures much o ' the range of the data (see Figure 5.10 on page 90).

Average predictive difference in probability of switching, comparing householders with 0 and 12 years of education.

The “multilevel” part of the model involves assigning a multivariate distribution to the vector of /3’s within each group, as we discuss in Section 13.1. FIVE WAYS TO W RITE THE SAME MODEL 263 For now we will focus on varying-intercept models , in which the only coefficient that varies across groups is the constant term /?o (which, to minimize subscripting, we label a). For the radon data that include the floor and a county-level uranium predictor, the model then becomes Hi — <Xj[i] + Pi Xu + P2X12 + €i where Xu is the ith element of the vector X ^ representing the first-floor indicators and Xi 2 is the zth element of the vector X( 2 ) representing the uranium measurement in the county containing house i. We can also write this in matrix notation as Vi = OLj [¿] + X i P + a with the understanding that X includes the first-floor indicator and the county uranium measurement but not the constant term. This is the way that models are built using ImerO, including all predictors at the individual level, as we discuss in Section 12.6. The second level of the model is simply a j ~ N(/za ,<T^). (12.5) Group-level errors. The model (12.5) can also be written as a j = fia + r)j, with Tjj ~ N( 0 ,er£). (12.6) The group-level errors r\\j can be helpful in understanding the model; however, we often use the more compact notation (12.5) to reduce the profusion of notation. (We have also toyed with notation such as a j = fia + e? in which e is consistently used for regression errors—but the superscripts seem too confusing. As illustrated in Part 2B of this book, we sometimes use such notation when programming models in Bugs.) Combining separate local regressions An alternative way to write the multilevel model is as a linking of local regressions in each group. Within each group j , a regression is performed on the local predictors (in this case, simply the first-floor indicator, a^), with a constant term a that is indexed by group: within county j : yi N (aj + Pxi,(jy), for i = 1 ,,rij', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models', 'author': 'Andrew Gelman', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\Methods_3\\pdf_material\\Data Analysis Using Regression and MultilevelHierarchical Models.pdf', 'date_published': '2018-03-02', 'keywords': 'statistics, data, analysis, multilevel, hierarchical, modelling, regression', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Methods_3_data_analysis_using_regression_and_multilevelhierarchical_models_page-237-278.json_chunk_39', 'course': 'Methods_3'}, 'bm25_score': 2.5108113288879395, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': -1.5445554}, {'id': 'cognition_and_communication_infants_infer_potential_social_partners_by_observing_the_interactions_of_their_parent_with_unknown_others.json_chunk_8', 'text': '. We took advantage of infants ’ tendency to look toward a visual event that is the inferred source of an accompanying sound (32 – 35). After following the same procedure as in study 1, the reaching trial was replaced by a speaking trial; the two puppets from the previous interactions, side by side, moved their mouths in synchrony while a single voice, speaking with high and exaggerated pitch, addressed the infant by name (e.g., “ Hi, Ashley! Hi! ” ). Infants recognize their own name by 4 mo of age (36, 37), and people who know one another ’ s names are more likely to be social partners. We asked whether infants would infer that the voice calling to them by name came from the puppet imitated by their parent and therfore would look to that puppet in anticipation of future comunicative behavior. We preregistered the prediction of longer looking to the parent-imitated puppet on this trial but not in the visual preference trial ( SI Appendix for discussion). In study 2 (preregistered: https://osf.io/pbfzv ), infants ( n = 18, aged 11 mo, 15 d to 12 mo, 15 d) looked toward the puppet whom their own parent had imitated during the speaking trial ( M = 0.620, SD = 0.183, BF 10 = 8.843). This pattern selectively followed their own parent ’ s social behavior; after seeing a diffeent infant ’ s parent imitate one of two puppets, infants did not look at the imitated puppet during the speaking trial ( M = 0.485, SD = 0.140, BF 01 = 1.264; difference between the own parent and other parent yoked control condition, BF 10 = 17.527). Infants also did not look more toward the imtated puppet in the silent visual preference trial, either after watcing their own parent ( M = 0.529, SD = 0.101, BF 01 = 2.25) or after watching the unfamiliar parent ( M = 0.484, SD = 0.133, BF 01 = 3.70; Fig. 2 B ). We replicated the results from the own-parent condition in an independent group of infants in study 3 (preregistered: https:// osf.io/52bx4 , n = 23 infants, aged 11 mo, 15 d to 12 mo, 15 d)', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'research_paper', 'title': 'Infants infer potential social partners by observing the interactions of their parent with unknown others', 'author': 'Unknown', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\cognition_and_communication\\pdf_material\\infants_infer_potential_social_partners.pdf', 'date_published': '2022-07-22', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'cognition_and_communication_infants_infer_potential_social_partners_by_observing_the_interactions_of_their_parent_with_unknown_others.json_chunk_8', 'course': 'cognition_and_communication'}, 'bm25_score': 3.422513723373413, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': -2.1574924}]"

The user did not make an error. The system made the error, and it is the system’s responsibility to correct or work around the error (Pearl, 2018a,b). What should happen is more or less what happens when people talk and one does not understand what the other says. If you and I are talking and I say something and you don’t understand me, you tell me you don’t understand or give me a quizzical look, and I repeat or rephrase what I said. If I say something and you mis understand me, the conversation may continue until the misunderstanding is exposed, then both of us work to correct the misunderstanding. Most voice-controlled systems nowadays rate the confidence that they understood a user utterance. If the system’s confidence that it understood a user command is below a certain threshold, the system should say something like “I’m sorry; I didn’t get that. Could you repeat it?” Even if the system estimates with high confidence that it understood a user, it can repeat what it understood before continuing. That allows misunderstandings to be caught and corrected quickly. IMPORTANT TAKEAWAYS l Errors can be classified as mistakes or slips. Mistakes are conscious errors—you make an intentional choice that turns out to be wrong. Slips are unconscious errors—you do something you didn’t intend to do. l Slips are categorized into several types depending on what causes them: l Capture: while doing one thing, you absent-mindedly switch to doing another. l Description: your action is appropriate for an object different from the one you are working with. l Data-driven: while doing a task, something else distracts you. l Loss of activation: you forget what you were doing or why. l Closure: you forget the last step of a task. l Mode: your actions have a different effect than intended because the system you are using is in a different mode than you thought it was. l Attention: failing to notice important information and so doing the wrong thing. l Motor: your fingers, mouth, legs, etc. don’t do what you intended', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Designing with the Mind in Mind', 'author': 'Jeff Johnson', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Human_computer_interaction\\pdf_material\\Designing with the Mind in Mind.pdf', 'date_published': '2020-08-13', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Human_computer_interaction_designing_with_the_mind_in_mind_page-259-274.json_chunk_13', 'course': 'Human_computer_interaction'}, 'bm25_score': 2.413944721221924, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': -4.13885}, {'id': 'Methods_1_statistics_for_linguists_an_introduction_using_r_page-1-26.json_chunk_7', 'text': '. For now, it’s best if you stick to ‘ <- ’, which is also what most R style guides recommend. As you will be using the ‘ <- ’ assign operator constantly, make sure to learn its shortcut: ALT + minus. The x can be used in further mathematical operations as if it’s a number. x / 2 [1] 3 Crucially, R is case-sensitive. Typing in capital ‘ X ’ yields an error message because the object capital ‘ X ’ does not exist in your ‘working environment’. X Error: object \'X\' not found To retrieve a list of all objects in your current working environment, type ls() (this functionʼs name stands for ‘list’). ls() [1] ""x"" Since you just started a new session and only defined one object, your working environment only contains the object x . Notice one curiosity about the ls() funtion: it is one of the few functions in R that doesn’t need any arguments, which is why running the function without an argument didn’t produce an error message. 1.5. Numeric Vectors Up to this point, the object x only contained one number. One handy function to create multi-number objects is the concatenate function c() . The following code uses this function to put the numbers 2.3, 1, and 5 into one object. As before, typing the object’s name reveals its content. This command overrides the previous x . x <- c(2.3, 1, 5) x [1] 2.3 1.0 5.0 The object x is what is called a vector. In R, a ‘vector’ simply is a list of numbers. You can check how long a vector is with the length() function. length(x) [1] 3 As you will see shortly, there are different types of vectors. The vector x contains numbers, so it is a vector of type ‘numeric’. The mode() and class() function can be used to assess vector types. 4 People often either talk of a vector’s ‘atomic mode’ or ‘atomic class’. mode(x) [1] ""numeric"" class(x) [1] ""numeric"" It’s important to know what type of vector you are dealing with, as certain matematical operations can only be applied to numeric vectors.

Extending prior work [ 80 ], these social behaviors are emergent rather than pre-programmed. 3.4.1 Information Diffusion. As agents notice each other, they may engage in dialogue—as they do so, information can spread from agent to agent. For instance, in a conversation between Sam and Tom at the grocery store, Sam tells Tom about his candidacy in the local election: Sam: Hey Tom, how’s it going? Tom: Good, thanks. What’s up? Sam: Well, I wanted to talk to you about something. I’m actually running for mayor in the upcoming local election. Tom: Really? That’s great news! Why are you runing?

what is cognitive modelling?,"Cognitive modeling refers to the process of creating abstract representations or models of human cognition, behavior, and decision-making processes. It involves using mathematical, computational, or other analytical techniques to simulate, explain, and predict various aspects of human thought, perception, attention, memory, learning, problem-solving, language processing, reasoning, and social behavior.

Cognitive modeling can be applied in a wide range of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, computer science, linguistics, anthropology, sociology, education, and business. The goal is to develop more accurate and comprehensive understanding of human cognition and its relationship with the brain, environment, and society.

Some common approaches used in cognitive modeling include:

1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML): These involve developing computational models that mimic human cognition, such as neural networks, decision trees, or probabilistic models.
2. Mathematical Modeling: This involves using mathematical equations to describe the dynamics of complex cognitive processes, such as attention, memory, or language processing.
3. Agent-Based Modeling: This approach simulates the behavior of multiple agents (e.g., humans, animals, or robots) interacting with each other and their environment.
4. Symbolic Reasoning: This involves using formal languages, logic, and rules to model human reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving processes.

Cognitive modeling can be used for various purposes, such as:

1. Understanding human behavior and cognition
2. Predicting human decision-making and choice-making
3. Developing artificial intelligence systems that mimic human thought and behavior

Cognitive models, including the three classes highlighted here, decompose cognition into meaningful functional components. By declaring their models independent of the implementation in the brain, cognitive scientists are able to address high-level cognitive processes 21 , 97 , 98 that are beyond the reach of current neural networks. Cognitive models are essential for cognitive computational neurscience because they enable us to see the whole as we attempt to understand the roles of the parts. Box 4 | Why do cognitive science, computational neuroscience and AI need one another? Cognitive science needs computational neuroscience, not merely to explain the implementation of cognitive models in the brain, but also to discover the algorithms. For example, the dominant models of sensory processing and object recognition are brain-inspired neural networks, whose computations are not easily captured at a cognitive level. Recent successes with Bayesian nonparametric models do not yet in general scale to real-world cognition. Explaining the computational efficiency of human cognition and predicting detailed cognitive dynamics and behavior could benefit from studying brain-activity dynaics. Explaining behavior is essential, but behavioral data alone provide insufficient constraints for complex models. Brain data can provide rich constraints for cognitive algorithms if leveraged appropriately. Cognitive science has always progressed in close interaction with artificial intelligence. The disciplines share the goal of building task-performing models and thus rely on comon mathematical theory and programming environments. Computational neuroscience needs cognitive science to challenge it to engage higher-level cognition. At the experimental level, the tasks of cognitive science enable computational neuroscience to bring cognition into the lab. At the level of theory, cognitive science challenges computational neuroscience to explain how the neurobiological dynamical components it studies contribute to cognition and behavior', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'research_paper', 'title': 'Cognitive computational neuroscience', 'author': 'Nikolaus Kriegeskorte', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Adv_cog_neuroscience\\pdf_material\\Kriegeskorte-2018-Cognitive-computational-neuroscienc.pdf', 'date_published': '2018-08-27', 'keywords': '', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience_cognitive_computational_neuroscience.json_chunk_30', 'course': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience'}, 'bm25_score': 2.452899932861328, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 4.607554}, {'id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_doi10.1016j.cub.2006.05.040.json_chunk_4', 'metadata': {'author': 'Unknown', 'chunk_id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_doi10.1016j.cub.2006.05.040.json_chunk_4', 'course': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science', 'date_published': '2006-06-14', 'document_type': 'research_paper', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\philosophy_of_cognitive_science\\pdf_material\\byrne_bates_why_are_animals_cognitive.pdf', 'title': 'doi:10.1016/j.cub.2006.05.040'}, 'text': '. This is where cognitive explanation comes in: cognition offers an interlingua between brain and behaviour [10] . Using the conceptual tools of cognitive science — theory of mind, working memory, focus of attention, cognitive map, number concept and counting, procedural knowledge, problem-solving, and many others — allows theories to be developed, simple enough to be comprehended and used to make testable predictions in natural environments, yet tight enough to be mapped precisely onto observed behaviour. (In principle, cognitive explanations can also be meshed with brain structures, but in animal work this is in practice more often a hope for the future, waiting for developments in imaging that can be used under relatively natural conditions.) An everyday analogy may be made with our understanding of how a television works. There is no doubt that its ‘behaviour’ — showing moving images of things happening at other places and times — is fundamentally caused by the electronics. However, handing us a full circuit diagram would seldom be educationally helpful. Rather, what is needed is an intervening level of explanation, in which it can be explained that images are sliced up, salami-fashion, then relayed as a linear signal, travelling neainstantaneously along wires as electric waves and across space as radio waves, finally rassembled by the electronics of the set. Only with the aid of this ‘cognitive model’ can one start to discuss intelligently the origin of that odd flicker or annoying stripe on the picture, and begin to decide whether it relates to characteristics of the set, the aerial, or the transmitter. The same applies in biology. For an animal as simple as the sea-slug Aplysia , with under 20,000 neurons, many of them very large, expecting to explain behaviour directly by tracing Figure 1', 'distance': 0.32430702447891235, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 2.4194484}, {'id': 'Adv_cognitive_modelling_farrell-2018-computational-modeling-of-cognition_page-1-21.json_chunk_1', 'text': '1 Introduction This introductory chapter pursues three principal goals. First, we show that computtional modeling is essential to ensure progress in cognitive science. Second, we provide an introduction to the abstract idea of modeling and its many and varied applications. Third, we survey some of the issues involved in the interpretation of model output, including in particular how models can help constrain scientists’ own thinking. 1.1 Models and Theories in Science Cognitive scientists seek to understand how the mind works. That is, we want to describe and predict people’s behavior, and we ultimately wish to explain it, in the same way that physicists predict the motion of an apple that is dislodged from its tree (and can accrately describe its downward path) and explain its trajectory (by appealing to gravity). For example, if you forget someone’s name when you are distracted seconds after being introduced to her, we would like to know what cognitive process is responsible for this failure. Was it lack of attention? Forgetting over time? Can we know ahead of time whether or not you will remember that person’s name? The central thesis of this book is that to answer questions such as these, cognitive scientists must rely on quantitative mathematical models, just like physicists who research gravity. We suggest that to expand our knowledge of the human mind, consideration of the data and verbal theorizing are insufficient on their own. This thesis is best illustrated by considering something that is (just a little) simpler and more readily understood than the mind. Have a look at the data shown in Figure 1.1, which represent the position of planets in the night sky over time', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Computational modeling of cognition', 'author': 'Farell', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Adv_cognitive_modelling\\pdf_material\\Farrell-2018-Computational-modeling-of-cognition.pdf', 'date_published': '2018', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Adv_cognitive_modelling_farrell-2018-computational-modeling-of-cognition_page-1-21.json_chunk_1', 'course': 'Adv_cognitive_modelling'}, 'bm25_score': 2.588524341583252, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 2.1655293}, {'id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_on_(not)_defining_cognition.json_chunk_12', 'text': '. Such general modeling efforts do not, however, proceed by first using a general concept of cognition to determine what should or should not be included in the model. Rather, they attempt to combine elements of other theories and models into an architecture that can solve more complex and realistic tasks. For example, John Anderson’s seminal work in this area extends theories of problem solving (esp. Newell and Simon 1972 ) with ideas from learning theory, by treating production rules as the targets of a basic learning mechanism ( Anderson 1983 , 1993 ). In the context of such general models, the notion of cognition is not prcisely defined, although general characterization of a cognitive system is sometimes attempted. For example, Simon and Newell ( 1970 ) describe human thinking as an information-processing system, but they note that details of the system are “elusive” ( 1970 , p. 149) because of its adaptive nature. If “adaptive information processing” is Synthese (2017) 194:4233–4249 4239 a reasonable working definition of cognition—a definition suitable, that is, for oriening newcomers to phenomena of potential interest—it is inadequate for the kind of ontological purposes that have driven philosophers to seek the mark of the cognitive. This is because the key notions of adaptiveness and information are no less a source of ambiguity or controversy than ‘cognition’. One might, for example, raise questions about the timescale over which a cognitive system should manifest adaptive procesing: momentary, lifetime, multigenerational, or evolutionary? This issue is entirely germane to the question of whether plants engage in adaptive information processing, since their responses to changes in environmental conditions tend to happen much more slowly than those of animals. The notion of information proves just as prolematic', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'research_paper', 'title': 'On (not) defining cognition', 'author': 'Colin Allen', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\philosophy_of_cognitive_science\\pdf_material\\Allen-2017-On-not-defining-cognition.pdf', 'date_published': '2017-06-02', 'keywords': 'Cognition,Definition,Animals,Extended mind,Group cognition,Pluralism', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_on_(not)_defining_cognition.json_chunk_12', 'course': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science'}, 'bm25_score': 2.6863789558410645, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 1.7354803}, {'id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_cognitive_psychology_history.json_chunk_12', 'text': '. The movment continues to be in fl uential and increasingly focuses on computational models of cognition. What has changed since its inception in the 1970s is the kind of computational model in favor. Newer Directions: Connectionism and Cognitive Neuroscience Connectionist Modeling The computer models that dominated cognitive psychology from its inception used complex symbols as representations, and processed these representations in a rule-based fashion (e.g., in a model of object recognition, the representation for a frog might consist of a conjunction of complex properties, and the rule for recognition might look something like ‘ If it ’ s green, small, and croaks, it ’ s a frog ’ ). Starting in the early 1980s, an alternative kind of cognitive model started to attract interest, namely ‘ connectionist ’ (or ‘ parallel distributed processing ’ ) models. These proposals have the form of neural networks, consisting of nodes (representations) that are densely inteconnected, with the connections varying in strength (see the bottom of Figure 1 ). In 1981 Hinton and Anderson published a book surveying then existent connectionist models ( Hinton and Anderson, 1981 ), and in the same year McClelland and Rumelhart (1981) presented a connectionist model of word recognition that explained a wide variety of experimental results. The fl oodgates had been opened, and connectionist models of perception, memory, and language proliferated, to the point where they now dominate computational approaches to cognition. Why the great appeal? One frequently cited reason is neurological plausibility : the models are clearly closer to brain function than are traditional rule-based models. A second reason is that connectionist models permit parallel constraint satisfaction : different sources of activation can converge simutaneously on the same representations or response', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'research_paper', 'title': 'Cognitive Psychology: History', 'author': 'Edward E.

This development has resulted from the realization that across a wide variety of tasks the fundamental problem the cognitive system confronts is coping with uncertainty. From visual scene recognition to on-line language comprehension, from categorizing stimuli to determining to what degree an argument is convincing, people must deal with the incompleteness of the information they possess to perform these tasks, many of which have important survival-related consequences. This paper provides a review of Bayesian models of cognition, dividing them up by the different aspects of cognition to which they have been applied. The paper begins with a brief review of Bayesian inference. This falls short of a full technical introduction but the reader is referred to the relevant literature for further details. There follows reviews of Bayesian models in Perception, Categorization, Learning and Causality, Language Processing, Inductive Reasoning, Deductive Reasoning, and Argumentation. In all these areas, it is argued that sophisticated Bayesian models are enhancing our understanding of the underlying cognitive computations involved. It is concluded that a major challenge is to extend the evidential basis for these models, especially to accounts of higher level cognition. \uf6d9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. WIREs Cogn Sci 2010 1 811–823 INTRODUCTION F rom the point of view of the brain, nothing is certain.

At the level of theory, cognitive science challenges computational neuroscience to explain how the neurobiological dynamical components it studies contribute to cognition and behavior. Computational neuroscience needs AI, and in particular machine learning, to provide the theoretical and technological basis for modeling cognitive functions with biologically plausible dynamical components. Artificial intelligence needs cognitive science to guide the engineering of intelligence. Cognitive science’s tasks can serve as benchmarks for AI systems, building up from elementary cognitive abilities to artificial general intelligence. The literatures on human development and learning provide an essential guide to what is possible for a learner to achieve and what kinds of interaction with the world can support the acquisition of intelligence. AI needs computational neuroscience for algorithmic inspiration. Neural network models are an example of a brain-inspired technology that is unrivalled in several domains of AI. Taking further inspiration from the neurobiological dynamical components (for example, spiking neurons, dendritic dynamics, the canonical cortical microcircuit, oscillations, neuromodulatory processes) and the global functional layout of the human brain (for example, subsystems specialized for distinct functions, including sensory modalities, memory, planning and motor control) might lead to further AI breakthroughs. Machine learning draws from separate traditions in statistics and computer science, which have optimized statistical and computational efficiency, respectively. The integration of computational and statistical efficiency is an essential challenge in the age of big data. The brain appears to combine computational and statistical efficiency, and understanding its algorithm might boost machine learning. Looking ahead Bottom up and top down. The brain seamlessly merges bottoup discriminative and top-down generative computations in peceptual inference, and model-free and model-based control', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'research_paper', 'title': 'Cognitive computational neuroscience', 'author': 'Nikolaus Kriegeskorte', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Adv_cog_neuroscience\\pdf_material\\Kriegeskorte-2018-Cognitive-computational-neuroscienc.pdf', 'date_published': '2018-08-27', 'keywords': '', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience_cognitive_computational_neuroscience.json_chunk_31', 'course': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience'}, 'bm25_score': 2.811366319656372, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 1.2289121}, {'id': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience_cognitive_computational_neuroscience.json_chunk_11', 'text': '. In the simplest case, decoding reveals which of two stimuli gave rise to a measured response pattern. Artificial intelligence Computational neuroscience Cognitive science Explain neuronal activity patterns Explain behavioral data computational modelsthat perform complex cognitive tasks using biologically plausibleFig. 2 | What does it mean to understand how the brain works? The goal of cognitive computational neuroscience is to explain rich measurements of neuronal activity and behavior in animals and humans by means of biologically plausible computational models that perform real-world cognitive tasks. Historically, each of the disciplines (circles) has tackled a subset of these challenges (white labels). Cognitive computational neuroscience strives to meet all the challenges simultaneously. The content of the representation can be the identity of a sensory stimulus (to be recognized among a set of alternative stimuli), a stimulus property (such as the orientation of a grating), an abstract variable needed for a cognitive operation, or an action 60 . When the decoder is linear, as is usually the case, the decodable information is in a format that can plausibly be read out by downstream nerons in a single step. Such information is said to be ‘explicit’ in the activity patterns 61 . Decoding and other types of multivariate pattern analysis have helped reveal the content of regional representations 55 , 56 , 58 , 59 , prviding evidence that brain-computational models must incorprate. However, the ability to decode particular information does not amount to a full account of the neuronal code: it doesn’t specify the representational format (beyond linear decodability) or what other information might additionally be present. Most importantly, decoders do not in general constitute models of brain computation. They reveal aspects of the product, but not the prcess of brain computation. Representational models', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'research_paper', 'title': 'Cognitive computational neuroscience', 'author': 'Nikolaus Kriegeskorte', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Adv_cog_neuroscience\\pdf_material\\Kriegeskorte-2018-Cognitive-computational-neuroscienc.pdf', 'date_published': '2018-08-27', 'keywords': '', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience_cognitive_computational_neuroscience.json_chunk_11', 'course': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience'}, 'bm25_score': 2.8288049697875977, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 0.94882035}, {'id': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience_cognitive_computational_neuroscience.json_chunk_15', 'text': '. The label BCM does not imply that the model is either plausible or consistent with empirical data. Progress is made by rejecting candidate BCMs on empirical grounds. Like microscale biophysical models , which capture biological prcesses that underlie brain computations, and macroscale braidynamical and causal-interaction models , BCMs are models of processes occurring in the brain. However, unlike the other types of process model, BCMs perform the information prcessing that is thought to be the function of brain dynamics. Finally, the term “model” is used to refer to models of the world employed by the brain, as in model-based reinforcement learning and model-based cognition . In this section, we considered three types of model that can help us glean computational insight from brain-activity data. Connectivity models capture aspects of the dynamic interactions between regions. Decoding models enable us to look into brain regions and reveal what might be their representational content. Representational models enable us to test explicit hypotheses that fully characterize a region’s representational space. All three types of model can be used to address theoretically motivated questions—taking a hypothesis-driven approach. However, in the absence of task-performing computational models, they are subject to Newell’s argument that asking a series of questions might never reveal the computational mechanism underlying the cognitive feat we are trying to explain. These methods fall short of building the bridge all the way to theory because they do not test mechanistic models that specify precisely how the information processing underlying some cognitive function might work. From theory to experiment To build a better bridge between experiment and theory, we first need to fully specify a theory. This can be achieved by defining the theory mathematically and implementing it in a computtional model (Box 1 )', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'research_paper', 'title': 'Cognitive computational neuroscience', 'author': 'Nikolaus Kriegeskorte', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Adv_cog_neuroscience\\pdf_material\\Kriegeskorte-2018-Cognitive-computational-neuroscienc.pdf', 'date_published': '2018-08-27', 'keywords': '', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience_cognitive_computational_neuroscience.json_chunk_15', 'course': 'Adv_cog_neuroscience'}, 'bm25_score': 2.5387332439422607, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 0.892856}, {'id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_what_might_cognition_be,_if_not_computation.json_chunk_29', 'text': '. Generally speaking, a model is aother entity which is either better understood already, or somehow more amenable to exploration, and which is similar in relevant rspects to the explanatory target. Scientific models are either cocrete objects, or-more commonly-abstract mathematical entities; very often, they can be understood as state-dependent systems. If a model is sufficiently good, then we suppose that it somehow captures the nature of the explanatory target. What does this mean? Well, if WHAT MIGHT COGNITION BE, IF NOT COMPUTATION? 365 the model is an abstract state-dependent system, then we suppose that the target system realizes the abstract system, or one relevantly like it. If the model is a concrete system, then we suppose that the model and the target system are systems of the same kind, in the sense that they both realize the same abstract system (or relevantly similar systems). Thus, even when providing a concrete model, what the scientist is really interested in determining is the abstract struture in the behavior of the target system. There is a vast range of abstract state-dependent systems. Schools of thought which differ over the nature of cognition can be seen as differing over which of these abstract systems are realized by cogntive systems; or, put differently, as differing over where in the range of all possible systems the best models of cognition are to be found. So we can understand everyone as agreeing that cognitive systems are state-dependent systems of some kind, but as disagreeing as to which more particular category of state-dependent systems they belong.

what is the prefrontal cortex?,"Based on the provided texts, here's what I can tell you about the prefrontal cortex:

1. In [9], it's mentioned that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is responsible for a more reflective processing of rewards.
2. In [10], the prefrontal cortex is described as being involved in complex, goal-directed behaviors across species.

However, I don't see any specific definition or detailed information about what the prefrontal cortex actually is. But based on general knowledge and cognitive science concepts, here's a brief overview:

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a region of the brain located just behind the forehead. It's responsible for executive functions, such as planning, decision-making, working memory, attention, and impulse control. The PFC also plays a crucial role in social behavior, empathy, and emotional regulation.

In more specific terms, the prefrontal cortex can be divided into different sub-regions, each with distinct functions:

* Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex: involved in working memory, planning, and decision-making
* Ventromedial prefrontal cortex: associated with emotional processing, empathy, and social behavior
* Anterior cingulate cortex: plays a role in conflict monitoring, error detection, and motivation

These sub-regions work together to enable complex cognitive processes like problem-solving, risk-taking, and self-awareness.

There is evidence that prefrontal regions are particularly important in the direction of central cognition, often known as executive control . The prefrontal cortex is that portion of the frontal cortex anterior to the premotor region (the premotor region is area 6 in Figure 1.7 ). Just as damage to parietal regions results in deficits in the deployment of perceptual attention, damage to prefrontal regions results in deficits of executive control. Patients with such damage often seem totally driven by the stimulus and fail to control their behavior according to their intentions. A patient who sees a comb on the table may be unable to inhibit the action of picking it up and beginning to comb her hair; another who sees a pair of glasses cannot help putting them on, even if he already has a pair on his face. Patients with damage to prefrontal regions show marked deficits in the Stroop task and often cannot refrain from saying the word rather than naming the color ( Janer & Pardo, 1991 ). Two prefrontal regions shown in Figure 3.2 seem particularly important in executive control. One is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) , which is the upper portion of the prefrontal cortex. It is called dorsolateral because it is high (dorsal) and to the side (lateral). The second region is the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) , which is folded under the visible surface of the brain along the midline. The DLPFC seems particularly important in the setting of intentions and the control of behavior. For instance, it is highly active during the simultaneous performance of dual tasks such as those whose results are reported in Figures 3.23 and 3.24 ( Szameitat, Schubert, Muller, & von Cramon, 2002 ). The ACC seems particularly active when people must monitor conflict between competing tendencies. For instance, brain-imaging studies show that it is highly active in Stroop trials when a participant must name the color of a color word printed in an ink of conflicting color ( Pardo, Pardo, Janer, & Raichle, 1990 )', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications', 'author': 'John R.

Then, after Central sulcus Prefrontal cortex ▲ FIGURE 24.6 Prefrontal cortex. The brain rostral to the central sulcus is the frontal lobe. The prefrontal cortex is the anterior portion of the frontal lobe that receives afferents from the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus. 832 PART FOUR THE CHANGING BRAIN ten correct card placements have been made, the sorting category is changed, and the subject starts over again. To perform well on this test, a person must use memory of previous cards and errors in order to plan the next card placement. People with prefrontal lesions have great diffi - culty on this task when the sorting category is changed; they continue to sort according to a rule that no longer applies. It appears that they have a working memory defi cit that limits their ability to make use of recent information to change their behavior. The same kind of defi cit is seen in other tasks. For example, a person with a prefrontal lesion might be asked to trace a path through a maze drawn on a piece of paper. Although the patient understands the task, he or she will repeatedly make the same mistakes, returning to blind alleys. In other words, these patients do not learn from their recent experience in the same way as a normal person, suggesting a working memory defi cit. The neurons in prefrontal cortex have a variety of response types, some of which may refl ect a role in working memory. Figure 24.8 shows two response patterns obtained while a monkey performed a delayeresponse task. The neuron in the top trace responded while the animal fi rst saw the food wells, was unresponsive during the delay interval, and responded again when the animal saw the food wells again (Figure 24.8a). The response of the neuron simply correlates with visual stimulation. More interesting is the response pattern of the other neuron, which fi red only during the delay interval (Figure 24.8b). This cell was not directly actvated by the stimuli in the fi rst or second interval in which the monkey saw the food wells', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Bear_2016_Neuroscience_Exploring_the_Brain', 'author': '', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\cognitive_neuroscience\\pdf_material\\Bear_2016_Neuroscience_Exploring_the_Brain.pdf', 'date_published': '2015-01-14', 'keywords': '', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'cognitive_neuroscience_bear_2016_neuroscience_exploring_the_brain_page-823-864.json_chunk_17', 'course': 'cognitive_neuroscience'}, 'bm25_score': 5.3409743309021, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 4.3512764}, {'id': 'intro_to_cognitive_science_cognitive_psychology_and_its_implications_page-1-851.json_chunk_33', 'text': '. The front portion, called the prefrontal cortex , is thought to control higher-level processes, such as planning. The frontal portion of the brain is disproportionately larger in primates than in most other mammals, and among primates, humans are distinguished by having disproportionately larger anterior portions of the prefrontal cortex (area 10 in Figure 1.7 ) ( Semendeferi, Armstrong, Schleicher, Zilles, & Van Hoesen, 2001 ). Figure 1.7 Some of the 52 Distinct Regions of the Cerebral Cortex Identified by Brodmann, Based on Cell Structure and Arrangement. Most of the numbered regions missing from this figure (areas 12–16, 23–36, and 48–51) are wrapped inside the brain and so are not visible in this exterior view. Description The Brodman regions are labeled from 1 to 52 except the areas 12 to 16, 23 to 36, and 48 to 51. The regions are colored and numbered. The regions 1, 5, 21, 42, 43, and 44 are colored in dark green. The regions 2, 4, 19, 11 are colored in red. The regions 3, 6, 11, 37, and 46 are colored in yellow. The regions 9, 17, 20, 40, and 52 are colored in blue. The regions 10, 39, and 18 are colored in light green. The regions 7, 8, 38, 41, and 45 are colored in pink. The region 22 is colored in purple. The neocortex is not the only region that plays a significant role in higher-level cognition. Many important circuits go from the cortex to subcortical structures and back again. A particularly significant group of subcortical structures is the limbic system, which is at the border between the cortex and lower structures. Among the structures making up the limbic system are the amygdala and the hippocampus (both of which are located inside the temporal lobe in each hemisphere). As we will see in later discussions, the amygdala is involved in emotional responses. The hippocampus appears to be critical to human memory; damage to the hippocampus and to other nearby structures produces severe amnesia, as we will see in Chapter 7', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications', 'author': 'John R.

Such a system can play a decisive role in the evaluation and selection of actions, and bias the action alternative that offers the greatest reward. 2.6 Prefrontal Cortex The frontal and in particular the prefrontal cortex are relatively voluminous in humans as compared to other species. For example, in dogs, the frontal cortex makes up about 7 % of the cortex, in monkeys about 17 %, and in humans, more than 30 %. Until fairly recently, this part of the brain was considered to be quite mysterious. By now, however, it has become clear that the neuronal populations of the frontal cortex are not just involved with the primary processing of light and sound stimuli, olfaction, taste, and tactile sensations, but mainly with so-called executive functions . When a human develops plans, makes judgments, forms intentions and transforms them into actions, then the frontal cortex is active. Besides this, the frontal cortex is crucial for working memory . This is a type of short-term storage that is required, for example, when people converse; to understand a spoken sentence, one must recall at the end what was said at the beginning. Such short-term memory is also required at a party, where one should remember who is already greeted, and who is yet to be greeted. More importantly, the frontal cortex checks the processes that occur on the way from intention to action, and recognizes posible errors . Even before you put sugar (instead of grated Parmesan cheese) on your spaghetti, your frontal cortex starts corrective measures and steers your hand away from the sugar and towards the Parmesan cheese. That the frontal region of the human brain is involved with intentions, and their conversion into actions, is corroborated by people with damage to this region. They often act thoughtlessly and prematurely, often change plans, ignore important infomation, and often commit errors without noticing it. Unless motor areas are affected, these patients are not noticeably or visibly disabled', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Hommel_2016_Human action control _ from intentions to movements', 'author': 'Unknown', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\perception_and_action\\pdf_material\\Hommel_2016_Human action control _ from intentions to movements.pdf', 'date_published': '2016-03-30', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'perception_and_action_hommel_2016_human_action_control___from_intentions_to_movements_page-11-42.json_chunk_42', 'course': 'perception_and_action'}, 'bm25_score': 5.330711841583252, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 3.2321658}, {'id': 'intro_to_cognitive_science_cognitive_psychology_and_its_implications_page-1-851.json_chunk_391', 'text': '. It is generally thought that in addition to these specific functions, the prefrontal cortex also plays a major role in the overall organization of behavior. The regions of the prefrontal cortex that we have discussed so far tend to be ventral (toward the bottom) and posterior (toward the back), and many of these regions are left lateralized. In contrast, dorsal (toward the top), anterior (toward the front), and bilateral prefrontal structures tend to be more involved in the organization of behavior. Goel and Grafman (2000) describe a patient, P.F., who suffered damage to his right anterior prefrontal cortex as the result of a stroke. Like many patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex, P.F. appears normal and even intelligent, scoring in the superior range on an intelligence test. Nonetheless, despite these surface appearances of normality, P.F. shows profound intellectual deficits. He had been a successful architect before his stroke but was forced to retire because he had lost his ability to design; he was then only able to find work as a draftsman. As part of their study, Goel and Grafman gave P.F. a problem that involved redesigning their laboratory space. Although he was able to speak coherently about the problem, he was unable to make any real progress on the solution (a comparably trained architect without brain damage achieved a good solution in a couple of hours). It seems that the stroke affected only P.F.’s most highly developed intellectual abilities. This chapter and Chapter 9 will look at what we know about the nature and the neural basis of human problem solving', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications', 'author': 'John R.

Figure 6.1 Brain Structures Involved in the Creation, Storage, and Retrieval of Memories. Prefrontal regions are responsible for the creation and retrieval of memories. The hippocampus and surrounding structures in the temporal cortex are responsible for the permanent storage of memories. Description The cerebral cortex covering the front part of the frontal lobe is labeled prefrontal cortex, small curvy region in the right and left hemispheres near the center of the brain is labeled hippocampus, and a region beneath the lateral fissure of the cerebral hemispheres is labeled temporal cortex. These prefrontal regions exhibit laterality effects similar to those noted at the beginning of Chapter 5 ( Gabrieli, 2001 ). Specifically, study of verbal material tends to engage the left hemisphere more than the right hemisphere, whereas study of pictorial material tends to engage the right hemisphere more. Human memory depends heavily on prefrontal structures of the brain for the creation and retrieval of memories and on temporal structures for the permanent storage of these memories. Sensory Memory Before reaching the structures in Figure 6.1 , information must be processed by perceptual systems, and these systems display a brief memory. There has been extensive research into the nature of these brief sensory memories. Visual Sensory Memory Many studies of visual sensory memory have used a procedure in which participants are presented with a visual array of items, such as the letters shown in Figure 6.2 , for a brief period of time (e.g., 50 ms). When asked to recall the items, participants are typically able to correctly report three, four, five, or at most six items. One might think that only this much material can be held in visual memory — yet participants report that they were aware of more items but the items faded before they could attend to them and report them.

The remaining regions highlighted in purple are as follows: primary motor cortex, 4; premotor cortex, 6; anterior premotor cortex, 8; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, 9; lateral front polar cortex, 10; a region between lateral front polar cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, 11; and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, 47, 45, and 44.The second illustration shows the brain of a monkey, in which the central portion of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is labeled 46 and its bottom portion is labeled 11.

Goldman-Rakic (1992) examined monkey performance on other tasks that require maintaining other types of information over a delay interval. In one task, monkeys had to remember different objects. For example, the animal would have to remember to select a red circle and not a green square. It appears that a different area of the prefrontal cortex is involved in this type of task. Different neurons in this area will fire depending on whether a red circle or a green square is being remembered. Goldman-Rakic speculated that the prefrontal cortex is parceled into many small regions, each of which is responsible for remembering a different kind of information. Like many neuroscience studies, these experiments are correlational — they show a relationship between neural activity and memory function, but they do not show that the neural activity is essential for the memory function', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications', 'author': 'John R.

Description The regions and their functions are as follows: A region in the prefrontal cortex is labeled dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Function: directs central cognition; a region in the frontal lobe located in the posterior precentral gyrus immediately anterior to the central sulcus is labeled motor cortex. Function: control hands. A region between dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and motor cortex located in the front of the corpus callosum, in the medial frontal lobe is labeled anterior cingulate (midline structure). Function: monitors conflict. Two arrows from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulated points to motor cortex; a region behind the frontal lobe, in front of the occipital lobe, and above the temporal lobe is labeled parietal cortex. Function: attends to locations and objects; a region in the primary visual cortex is labeled extrastriate cortex. Function: processes visual information; a region located on the superior temporal gyrus in the temporal lobe is labeled auditory cortex. Function: processes auditory information; and a small region in the top right of the auditory cortex is labeled primary auditory cortex. Two arrows from parietal cortex point to extrastriate cortex and auditory cortex. Attentional systems select information to process at serial bottlenecks where it is no longer possible to do things in parallel. Auditory Attention Some of the early research on attention was concerned with auditory attention, and much of this research centered on the dichotic listening task . In a typical dichotic listening experiment, illustrated in Figure 3.3 , participants wear a set of headphones. They hear two messages at the same time, one in each ear, and are asked to “shadow” one of the two messages (i.e., repeat back the words from that message only). Most participants are able to attend to one message and tune out the other.

So even though their choice behavior responded immediately to what they had been told, their FRN showed a slow learning process. It is as if their minds knew but their hearts had to learn. It is generally thought that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is responsible for a more reflective processing of rewards, while the dopamine neurons in the basal ganglia are responsible for a more reflexive processing of rewards. A number of neural imaging studies seem consistent with this interpretation. In one fMRI study, Knutson, Taylor, Kaufman, Peterson, and Glover (2005) presented participants with various uncertain outcomes, including in the magnitude and probability of rewards. For instance, on one trial participants might be told that they had a 50% chance of winning $5; on another trial that they had a 50% chance of winning $1 (i.e., the magnitude of the reward differed between trials). Similarly, participants might be told on one trial that they had an 80% chance of winning $5, and on another trial might be told that they had a 20% chance of winning $5 (i.e., the probability of the reward differed between trials). Knutson et al. imaged the brain activity associated with each such gamble. As shown in Figure 11.10a , the magnitude of the fMRI response in the nucleus accumbens in the basal ganglia reflected the different magnitudes of rewards (but did not reflect differences in the probabilities of rewards). In contrast, as shown in Figure 11.10b , the fMRI response in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex did reflect differences in the probabilities of rewards (but did not reflect differences in the magnitudes of rewards). Figure 11.10 Brain Activity in Response to Magnitude and Probability of Rewards. (a) The nucleus accumbens shows greater activity in response to a 50% chance of a $5 reward than to a 50% chance of a $1 reward.

(Source: Adapted from Xerri et al., 1994.) 608 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR is known that across species, the prefrontal cortex is involved in complex, goal-directed behaviors. It is also established that environment can change neurons; for example, dendritic branching and spine density are enhanced when animals are housed in an enriched environment. To see whether fatherhood alters brain structure, Gould’s group compared the prefrontal cortex of marmoset fathers with that of non-fathers who were part of a mating pair. Two interesting differences were found: The density of dedritic spines on pyramidal cells was signifi cantly higher in the fathers, and there appeared to be more vasopressin receptors on the spines. The functional consequences of these changes are not known, but they suggest that brains in other species that invest much time in childrearing, whether by the male or female, might be structurally changed by the experience. Estrogen Effects on Neuron Function, Memory, and Disease. Estrogens have powerful activational effects on the structure and function of neurons. Within minutes of experimental application, estradiol alters the intrinsic excitability of neurons in a broad range of brain areas. By modulating the fl ow of potassium ions, estradiol depolarizes some neurons and causes them to fi re more action potentials. A dramatic example of the effects estrogen can have on cell structure is shown in Figure 17.19. Dominique Toran-Allerand at Columbia University found that estradiol treatment of tissue taken from the hypothalamus of newborn mice causes a great degree of neurite ougrowth. Other studies have shown that estradiol increases cell viability and spine density. Taken together, these fi ndings suggest that estrogens play an important role in forming neuronal circuitry during brain development', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Neuroscience Exploring the Brain (fourth edition)', 'author': 'Mark F.

Other lags are unlikely to make much interpretable sense and should be avoided. One way to determine more objectively whether differencing is required is to use aunit root test. These are statistical hypothesis tests of stationarity that are designed for determining whether differencing is required. A number of unit root tests are available, which are based on different assumptions and may lead to conflicting answers. In our analysis, we use theKwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test(Kwiatkowski et al., 1992). In this test, the null hypothesis is that the data are stationary, and we look for evidence that the null hypothesis is false. Consequently, small p-values (e.g., less than 0.05) suggest that differencing is required. The test can be computed using theunitroot_kpss()function. For example, let us apply it to the Google stock price data. The KPSS test p-value is reported as a number between 0.01 and 0.1. If the actual p-value is less than 0.01, it is reported as 0.01; and if the actual p-value is greater than 0.1, it is reported as 0.1. In this case, the p-value is shown as 0.01 (and therefore it may be smaller than that), indicating that the null hypothesis is rejected. That is, the data are not stationary. We can difference the data, and apply the test again. This time, the p-value is reported as 0.1 (and so it could be larger than that). We can conclude that the differenced data appear stationary. This process of using a sequence of KPSS tests to determine the appropriate number of first differences is carried out using theunitroot_ndiffs()feature. As we saw from the KPSS tests above, one difference is required to make thegoogle_2015data stationary. A similar feature for determining whether seasonal differencing is required isunitroot_nsdiffs(), which uses the measure of seasonal strength introduced in Section4.3to determine the appropriate number of seasonal differences required. No seasonal differences are suggested if\\(F_S<0.64\\), otherwise one seasonal difference is suggested', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'online_article', 'title': 'Forecasting: Principles and Practice (3rd ed)', 'author': 'Rob J Hyndman, George Athanasopoulos', 'source': 'https://otexts.com/fpp3/stationarity.html', 'date_published': '23 March 2025', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Data_science_forecasting_principles_and_practice_(3rd_ed)_49804c33.json_chunk_6', 'course': 'Data_science'}, 'bm25_score': 1.5267465114593506, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 1.5976036}, {'id': 'Human_computer_interaction_usability_(user)_testing_101.json_chunk_1', 'text': 'December 1, 20192019-12-01 Share Usabilitytesting (alternately calleduser testing) is a popular UX research methodology. In ausability-testingsession, a researcher (called a “facilitator” or a “moderator”) asks a participant to perform tasks, usually using one or more specific user interfaces. While the participant completes each task, the researcher observes the participant’s behavior and listens for feedback. The phrase “usability testing” is often used interchangeably with “user testing.” The goals of usability testing vary by study, but they usually include: Why do we need to do usability testing?Won’t a good professional UX designer knowhow to design a great user interface? Even the best UX designers can’t design a perfect — or even good enough — user experience withoutiterative designdriven by observations of real usersand of their interactions with the design. There are many variables in designing a modern user interface and there are even more variables in thehuman brain. The total number of combinations is huge.The only way to get UX design right is to test it. There are many different types of usability testing, but the core elements in most usability tests arethe facilitator, the tasks, and the participant. The facilitator administers tasks to the participant. As the participant performs these tasks, the facilitator observes the participant’s behavior and listens for feedback. The facilitator may also ask followup questions to elicit detail from the participant. Thefacilitatorguides the participantthrough the test process. She gives instructions, answers the participant’s questions, and asks followup questions. The facilitator works to ensure that the test results in high-quality, valid data, withoutaccidentally influencing the participant’s behavior.

The researcher uses a dedicatedonline remote-testing toolto set up written tasks for the participant. Then, the participant completes those tasks alone on her own time. The testing tool delivers the task instructions and any followup questions. After the participant completes her test, the researcher receives a recording of the session, along with metrics like task success. Simple,“discount” usabilitystudies can be inexpensive, though you usually must pay a few hundred dollars as incentives to participants. The testing session can take place in a conference room, and the simplest study will take 3 days of your time (assuming that you have already learned how to do it, and you have access to participants): On the other hand,more-expensive researchis sometimes required, and the cost can run into several hundred thousand dollars for the most elaborate studies.

It would be good to return some emphasis within NLP to cognitive and scientific investigation of language rather than almost exclusively using an engineering model of research. Overall, I think we should feel excited and glad to live in a time when Natural Language Processing is seen as so central to both the further development of machine learning and industry application problems. The future is bright. However, I would encourage everyone to think about problems, architectures, cognitive science, and the details of human language, how it is learned, processed, and how it changes, rather than just chasing state-of-the-art numbers on a benchmark task.

In some part, it’s for this reason that the best machine learning methods for modeling natural language are extremely flexible, left to their own devices to build internal representations of sentences. However, this flexibility comes at a cost. The most popular models in natural language processing research at this time are consideredblack boxes, offering few explicit cues to what they learn about how language works. Earlier machine learning methods for NLP learned combinations of linguistically motivated features—word classes likenounandverb, syntax trees for understanding how phrases combine, semantic labels for understanding the roles of entities—to implement applications involving understanding some aspects of natural language. Though it was difficult at times to understand exactly how these combinations of features led to the decisions made by the models, practitioners at least understood the features themselves. Recently, large-scale representation learning models like word2vec, GLoVe, ELMo, BERT, GPT2, XLNET, XLM, and others have replaced feature-based foundations to natural language processing systems. The representations of these models—vectors representing each word in each sentence—are used as features instead of linguistically motivated properties. Despite the unsupervised nature of representation learning models in NLP, some researchers intuit that the representations' properties may parallel linguistic formalisms. Gaining insights into the natures of NLP’s unsupervised representations may help us to understand why our models succeed and fail, what they’ve learned, and what we yet need to teach them. An emerging body of research has attempted to do just this – help us understand or interpret the properties of the internal representations of models like ELMo and BERT"", 'metadata': {'document_type': 'online_article', 'title': 'Designing and Interpreting Probes', 'author': 'John Hewitt', 'source': 'https://nlp.stanford.edu/~johnhew/interpreting-probes.html', 'date_published': 'Posted on 17 Aug 2019.', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Natural_language_processing_designing_and_interpreting_probes_·_john_hewitt.json_chunk_1', 'course': 'Natural_language_processing'}, 'bm25_score': 7.736257553100586, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 0.437658}]"

A good model finds the sweet spot between these two extremes.\n\n**Flashcard 3**\nFront: What is the difference between a generative model and a discriminative model?\nBack: Generative models, like GANs or VAEs, aim to generate new data samples that fit the underlying distribution of the training data. In contrast, discriminative models, like logistic regression or neural networks, focus on predicting the probability of certain outcomes given input features.\n\n**Flashcard 4**\nFront: What is the role of hyperparameters in machine learning?\nBack: Hyperparameters control the behavior of algorithms and models during training. They can be thought of as knobs to tweak when optimizing model performance. Examples include learning rates, hidden layer sizes, and number of iterations.\n\n**Flashcard 5**\nFront: What is cross-validation used for in machine learning?\nBack: Cross-validation is a technique to estimate how well a model generalizes to new, unseen data by splitting the available data into training, validation, and testing sets. It helps prevent overfitting and provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance.\n\nI hope these flashcards help you reinforce your understanding of machine learning concepts!"", ""I can help with that!

It's a common problem in machine learning that can lead to poor performance on test sets.\n\n**Flashcard 3**\nFront: What is the difference between training and testing in machine learning?\nBack: Training refers to using labeled data to learn a model, while testing involves evaluating the learned model on previously unseen data to measure its performance. The goal is to minimize overfitting by validating the model's generalization capabilities.\n\n**Flashcard 4**\nFront: What is regularization in machine learning?\nBack: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function that discourages large weights or complex models. This helps improve the model's generalizability and reduces its tendency to memorize training data.\n\n**Flashcard 5**\nFront: What is the role of feature engineering in machine learning?\nBack: Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into features that are more suitable for modeling, such as extracting relevant information, aggregating values, or creating derived variables. This step can significantly impact a model's performance by providing better input data.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to generate more flashcards or focus on specific topics within machine learning!"", ""What an interesting transition!

We provide an integrative account in which clear connections are made between empirical results and how these results can help us to understand our uncertain world.

Decisions do not emerge out of thin air but rather are informed by our prior experience, and each decision yields some information (did it work out well or badly?) that we can add to our stock of experience for future benefit.

This new edition highlights recent developments with expanded coverage of those topics among many others. All of the chapters have been updated with new sections and new references reflecting the advances in understanding. We have also added a new chapter on Explanation-based decision making which discusses the growing impact of that approach in elucidating how we make complex decisions.

Different language deficits appear depending on whether the damage is to Broca’s area or Wernicke’s area. People with Broca’s aphasia (i.e., damage to Broca’s area) speak in short, ungrammatical sentences. For instance, when one patient was asked whether he drives home on weekends, he replied: Why, yes Thursday, er, er, er, no, er, Friday Bar-ba-ra wife and, oh, car drive purnpike you know rest and teevee. ( Gardner, 1975, p. 61 ) In contrast, patients with Wernicke’s aphasia speak in fairly grammatical sentences that are almost devoid of meaning. Such patients have difficulty with their vocabulary and generate “empty” speech. The following is the answer given by one such patient to the question “What brings you to the hospital?” Boy, I’m sweating, I’m awful nervous, you know, once in a while I get caught up, I can’t mention the tarripoi, a month ago, quite a little, I’ve done a lot well.

Topographic Organization In many areas of the cortex, information processing is structured spatially in what is called a topographic organization . For instance, in the visual area at the back of the cortex, adjacent areas represent information from adjacent areas of the visual field (see the discussion around Figure 2.5 ). A similar principle of organization governs the representation of the body in the motor cortex and the somatosensory cortex along the central sulcus. Adjacent parts of the body are represented in adjacent parts of the neural tissue. Figure 1.10 illustrates the representation of the body along the somatosensory cortex.

KEY TERMS Mirror systems Neural circuits or regions that disregard the distinction between self and other. KEY TERM Iacoboni (2009) has argued that the mirror system for action may be co-opted by other regions of the brain to support empathy. Carr et al. (2003) examined a possible link between empathy and action perception/production using fMRI in humans. They showed participants emotional facial expressions under two con - di tions: observation versus deliberate imitation. They found increased activation for the imitation condition relative to observation in classical mirror-system areas such as the premotor cortex. In addition, they found increased activation in areas involved in emotion such as the amygdala and insula. Their claim was that imitation activates shared motor representations between self and other, but, crucially, there is a second step in which this information is relayed to limbic areas via the insula. This action-to-emotion route was hypothesized to underpin empathy. Simulation theories extend the notion of a mirror neuron (see Chapter 8) not only to action, but also to sensation (such as pain and touch) and emotion. The term mirror system is used to convey the idea of neural circuits that disregard the distinction between self and other, but need not necessarily imply action-coding mirror neurons. For example, the insula region is activated both when we are disgusted and when we look at someone else scrunching up their face in an expression of disgust (Phillips et al. , 1997). Moreover, people who score higher on questionnaire measures of empathy show greater activation of their own disgust regions when watching other people being disgusted (Jabbi et al. , 2007)', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': ""Ward - The Student's Guide to Cognitiv"", 'author': '', 'source': ""raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\intro_to_cognitive_science\\pdf_material\\Ward - The Student's Guide to Cognitiv.pdf"", 'date_published': '2015-07-08', 'keywords': '', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': ""intro_to_cognitive_science_ward_-_the_student's_guide_to_cognitiv_page-373-406.json_chunk_40"", 'course': 'intro_to_cognitive_science'}, 'bm25_score': 7.250764846801758, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 0.60750234}]"

"ok nice. Explain log-loss to me, i have a 10 category classification problem","Log-loss! Also known as cross-entropy loss, it's a popular performance metric in Bayesian modeling and deep learning.

In your 10-category classification problem, log-loss measures the model's ability to correctly predict the class labels. It calculates the negative log-likelihood of the true labels given the predicted probabilities.

Mathematically, log-loss (LL) is defined as:

LL = - ∑(y_true * log(y_pred) + (1-y_true) * log(1-y_pred))

where y_true is the one-hot encoded true label, and y_pred is the predicted probability distribution for each class.

To calculate log-loss, you'll need to:

1. Predict probabilities for each class using your Bayesian model.
2. Compute the negative log-likelihood using the formula above.

The lower the log-loss value, the better your model performs in terms of classification accuracy. In Python, you can use libraries like scikit-learn or Keras to compute log-loss.

what is a by-chance log loss of 10 categories?,"Given the context of log-loss in classification problems and your 10-category classification problem, I'd say that a by-chance log-loss value can serve as a baseline for evaluating your model's performance.

In a 10-category classification problem, a by-chance log-loss represents the expected log-loss value if you were to randomly guess the class labels. This is because, in the absence of any informative signal, your model would be reduced to simply guessing the categories at random.

A typical by-chance log-loss for a 10-category classification problem would depend on the prior distribution and the number of classes. However, as a rough estimate, you can use the following rule of thumb:

For a balanced dataset (i.e., roughly equal number of samples per class), the by-chance log-loss would be around 2-3.

To calculate this, you can consider the entropy of the uniform distribution over the 10 classes. This gives you an approximate value for the by-chance log-loss.

how eye work,"What a fascinating topic! Let's dive into how eyes work.

Eyes are incredibly complex organs that play a crucial role in our ability to perceive and interpret the world around us. Here's a simplified overview of how they function:

1. **Light enters the eye**: When light from an object enters your eye, it passes through the cornea (the transparent outer layer) and the pupil (the small opening).
2. **Lens focuses the light**: The light is then focused by the crystalline lens onto the retina. This is achieved by the lens changing shape to adjust for different distances.
3. **Photoreceptors convert light into electrical signals**: The light is absorbed by photoreceptors (rods and cones) in the retina, which convert it into electrical signals.
4. **Signals transmitted to the brain**: These electrical signals are transmitted to the optic nerve, a bundle of nerves that carries visual information from the eye to the brain.
5. **Brain interprets the signals**: The brain interprets these signals to create a visual representation of the world, including color, shape, movement, and depth.

In addition to this basic process, eyes also have other important functions:

* **Accommodation**: The lens adjusts focus for near or far vision.
* **Pupil control**: The pupil constricts or dilates to regulate the amount of light entering the eye.
* **Eye movements**: Eyes move to track targets and adjust focus.

In the context of cognitive science, understanding how eyes work is crucial in analyzing visual attention, perception, and cognition. Eye tracking technology can measure eye movements, providing valuable insights into human behavior, learning, and decision-making processes.

Although you could subsequently ask participants that question, their meory may not be completely accurate. With an eye tracking system, you can tell whether the participant at least fixated on the link long enough to read it. 7.1 HOW EYE TRACKING WORKS Although a few different technologies are used, many eye tracking systems, such as the one shown in Fig. 7.1 , use some combination of an infrared video camera and infrared light sources to track where the participant is looking. The infrared light sources create reflections on the surface of the participant's eye (called the coneal reflection), and the system compares the location of that reflection to the location of the participant's pupil. The location of the corneal reflection relative to the pupil changes as the partiipant moves his eyes. The first activity in any eye tracking study is to calibrate the system by asking the participants to look at a series of known points; then the system can subsequently interpolate where a participant is looking based on the location of the corneal reflection. Typically, the researcher can check the quality of the calibration, usually expressed as degrees that devate from the X and Y visual planes. Deviations less than one degree are geneally considered to be acceptable, and less than one-half of a degree is very good. Most eye tracking systems tell you something about the quality of the calibrtion and an opportunity to attempt another calibration to improve the accuracy. It is critical that the calibration is satisfactory; otherwise, all the eye movement data should not be recorded or analyzed. Without a good calibration, there will be a disconnect between what the participant is actually looking at and what you assume he/she is looking at.

As a UX researcher, eye tracking is a valuable method to better understand how someone visually interacts with any stimuli, answering fundamental questions such as: • What do they notice? • How long do they look at it? • What do they see first? • What don’t they notice (that they should)? Eye tracking has been around since the early 1900s. Huey (1908) devised a system whereby someone would wear a contact lens with a small hole for the pupil. The contact lens was then physically attached to a pointing device which would allow researchers to observe eye movements while reading text. Thankfully, we have come a long way since then. Eye tracking is now affordable (for most budgets), highly accurate, able to measure eye movements across a wide variety of stimuli and scenes, portable (through glasses), and the analysis and visualization tools are powerful and easy to use.

Eye tracking use is on the rise.While early devices were highly intrusive and involved particularly cumbersome procedures to set up, modern eye trackers have undergone quite a technological evolution in recent years. Long gone are the rigid experimental setups and seating arrangements you might think of. Modern eye trackers are hardly any larger than smart phones and provide an extremely natural experience for respondents. Remote, non-intrusive methods have made eye tracking both an easy-to-use andaccessible tool in human behavior researchthat allows objective measurements of eye movements in real-time. Most modern eye trackers utilize near-infrared technology along with a high-resolution camera (or other optical sensor) to track gaze direction. The underlying concept, commonly referred to asPupil Center Corneal Reflection (PCCR), is actually rather simple. It essentially involves the camera tracking the pupil center, and where light reflects from the cornea. An image of how this looks like is on the right. The math behind it is well, a bit more complex. We won‘t bore you with the nature of algorithms at this point. Image above: Pupil Center Corneal Reflection (PCCR). The light reflecting from the cornea and the center of the pupil are used to inform the eye tracker about the movement and direction of the eye. The accuracy of eye movement measurement heavily relies on a clear demarcation of the pupil and detection of corneal reflection. The visible spectrum is likely to generate uncontrolledreflections, while illuminating the eye with infrared light – which is not perceivable by the human eye – renders the demarcation of the pupil and the iris an easy task – while the light directly enters the pupil, it just reflects from the iris', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'online_article', 'title': 'Eye Tracking: The Complete Pocket Guide', 'author': 'Morten Pedersen', 'source': 'https://imotions.com/blog/learning/best-practice/eye-tracking/', 'date_published': '2022-08-02 08:00:00+00:00', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Human_computer_interaction_eye_tracking_the_complete_pocket_guide.json_chunk_2', 'course': 'Human_computer_interaction'}, 'bm25_score': 4.018542766571045, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 2.0545242}, {'id': 'Human_computer_interaction_eye_tracking_the_complete_pocket_guide.json_chunk_1', 'text': 'We carry a range of biosensors from the top hardware producers.

The Vestibulo-Ocular Refl ex (VOR). One very important function of the central vestibular system is to keep your eyes pointed in a particular drection, even while you are dancing like a fool. The vestibulo-ocular refl ex (VOR) performs this function. Recall that accurate vision requires the image to remain stable on the retinas despite movement of the head (see Chapter 9). Each eye can be moved by a set of six extraocular mucles. The VOR works by sensing rotations of the head and immediately commanding a compensatory movement of the eyes in the opposite diretion. The movement helps keep your line of sight tightly fi xed on a visual target. Because the VOR is a refl ex triggered by vestibular input rather than visual input, it works amazingly well even in the dark or when your eyes are closed. Imagine driving down a very bumpy road. From constant adjustments by the VOR, your view of the world ahead is quite stable because each bump, and its consequent movement of your head, is compensated by an eye movement. To appreciate how effective your VOR is, compare the stability of a passing object during the bumpy drive as you look at it fi rst with your eyes alone, and then with the viewfi nder of a simple camera. You’ll fi nd that your camera view jumps around hopelessly because your arms are not nearly quick or accurate enough to move the camera with each bump. Many cameras now have an electromechanical equivalent of a VOR that stabilizes an image even when the camera or the photogrpher holding it is bumping around. The effectiveness of the VOR depends on complicated connections from the semicircular canals to the vestibular nucleus to the cranial nerve nclei that excite the extraocular muscles. Figure 11.34, which shows only half of the horizontal component of this circuit, illustrates what happens when the head turns to the left and the VOR induces both eyes to turn right', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Bear_2016_Neuroscience_Exploring_the_Brain', 'author': '', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\cognitive_neuroscience\\pdf_material\\Bear_2016_Neuroscience_Exploring_the_Brain.pdf', 'date_published': '2015-01-14', 'keywords': '', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'cognitive_neuroscience_bear_2016_neuroscience_exploring_the_brain_page-369-413.json_chunk_67', 'course': 'cognitive_neuroscience'}, 'bm25_score': 3.78531813621521, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 0.79715526}, {'id': 'Human_computer_interaction_measuring_the_user_experience_page-177-193.json_chunk_2', 'text': "". In one way, eye tracking is based on a set of research questions that necessitate the need to analyze eye movements. This might involve comparing the visual attention patterns of two different web designs. In order to answer this question, the researcher must collect and analyze eye movement data. In this case, the “hit ratio” would tell them the percentage of participants who notice (or fixate) on an object in one web design compared to another web design. Another way in which eye tracking is often used in user research is simply to generate real-time qualitative insights. A stakeholder might be interested in observing the eye movements in real time or as part of a participant recording, without any intention of analyzing the data. Observing eye movements provides an additional layer of data to gain a more complete picture of the user experence. Sometimes, the only associated deliverable is a heat map, with any assocated metrics. No matter what approach you take with eye tracking, it is critical to determine the goals and the desired output before any work begins. The information provided by an eye tracking system can be remarkably useful as part of user research. Simply enabling observers to see where the participant is looking in real time is extremely valuable. Even if you do no further analyses of the eye tracking data, just this real-time display provides insight that would not be possible otherwise. For example, assume a participant is performing a task on a website and there's a link on the homepage that would take him directly to the page required to complete the task. The participant keeps exploring the website, going down dead ends, returning to the homepage, but never reaching the required page. In a situation like this, you would like to know whether the participant ever saw the appropriate link on the homepage or whether he saw the link but dismissed it as not what he wanted (e.g., because of its wording)"", 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Measuring the User Experience (third edition)', 'author': 'Bill ALbert, Tom Tullis', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Human_computer_interaction\\pdf_material\\Measuring the User Experience.pdf', 'date_published': '2022-09-11', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Human_computer_interaction_measuring_the_user_experience_page-177-193.json_chunk_2', 'course': 'Human_computer_interaction'}, 'bm25_score': 3.2358548641204834, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 0.6651652}, {'id': 'Human_computer_interaction_eye_tracking_the_complete_pocket_guide.json_chunk_5', 'text': '. In the following pages, we’ll go through some of the most common application areas for eye tracking, and see how it helps guide new discoveries and insight in each. Neuroscience and psychology utilize eye tracking to analyze the sequence of gaze patterns to gain deeper insights into cognitive processes underlying attention, learning, and memory. How do expectations shape the way we see the world? For example, if you see a picture of a living room, you will have an idea of how the furniture should be arranged. If the scene doesn’t match your expectations, you might be baffled and gaze around the scene as your “scene semantics” (your “rules” of how a living room should look) are violated. Another research area addresses how we encode and recall faces – where do we look to extract the emotional state of others? Eyes and mouth are the most important cues, but there’s definitely a lot more to it. Another research area addresses how we encode and recall faces – where do we look to extract the emotional state of others? Eyes and mouth are the most important cues, but there’s definitely a lot more to it. Eye tracking can also provide insights into processing of text, particularly how eye movements during reading are affected by the emotional content of the texts. Eye tracking can provide crucial information about how we attend to the world – what we see and how we see it. Why is it that some products make an impression on customers while others just don‘t get it right? Eye tracking has become a popular, increasingly vital tool in market research. Many leading brands actively utilize eye tracking to assess customer attention to key messages and advertising as well as to evaluate product performance, product and package design, and overall customer experience. When applied to in-store testing, eye tracking provides information about the ease and difficulty of in-store navigation, search behavior, and purchase choices.

To do this, simply measure the percentage deviation away from a baseline for each participant and average those deviations across the participants. Alternatively, you can measure the percentage of participants who experienced dilated pupils (of a certain amount) while attening to a particular graphic or performing a specific function. 7.8 SUMMARY In this chapter we covered eye tracking as a powerful tool in measuring visual attention and engagement. Eye tracking is becoming much easier to use, more accurate, more versatile and powerful, and even quite affordable. Here’s a \xadsummary of some of the key points to remember. 1. Eye tracking is the best way to measure visual attention of various aspects of a product, such as a website or mobile application. Eye tracing is used to compare the effectiveness of different designs, as well \xadcalculate metrics based on areas of interest. 2. Eye tracking typically works with the use of infrared technology. By comparing the position of the corneal reflection to the pupil, we can calculate the gaze direction at any time. 3. Calibration is a key part to any eye tracking study. It is important to obtain satisfactory calibration so you can accurately measure eye movements. 4. Eye tracking mobile applications require the use of glasses that permit tracking eye movements, and possibly a device stand to better control the testing environment. 5. Visualizations in eye tracking tell the story about where people were looking and when. The most common visualizations are scan paths showing the movement of fixations, along with their duration. Another popular visualization is a heatmap, which depicts the distribution of visual attention from, typically, a group of people. 6. Areas of Interest, or AOIs, are one of the most common ways to anlyze eye tracking data. AOIs are objects on the screen, such as a particular block of text, functionality, or image', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Measuring the User Experience (third edition)', 'author': 'Bill ALbert, Tom Tullis', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Human_computer_interaction\\pdf_material\\Measuring the User Experience.pdf', 'date_published': '2022-09-11', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Human_computer_interaction_measuring_the_user_experience_page-177-193.json_chunk_18', 'course': 'Human_computer_interaction'}, 'bm25_score': 3.3445138931274414, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 0.3265308}]"
what does each visual cortex do,"Based on the provided texts, here's a summary of what each ""visual cortex"" pathway does:

1. **Ventral Pathway (What Pathway)**: This pathway plays a central role in object recognition and provides information about an object's identity. It is also known as the ""what"" pathway. The ventral pathway is specialized in processing visual stimulus properties such as color, form, texture, and complex configurations like faces.

Damage to this pathway can lead to visual agnosia, where individuals have difficulty recognizing objects, even if they are simple stimuli like points of light or lines. However, they may still be able to recognize isolated features of objects or associate colors with objects.

2. **Dorsal Pathway (Where Pathway)**: This pathway provides information about the spatial location of objects and allows for localization in space (""where"" pathway). It is specialized in processing information about an object's position and movement.

Damage to this pathway can lead to difficulties in localizing objects in space, such as difficulty in judging distances or tracking moving objects.

Livingstone and Hubel (1988) proposed that the visual system processes these various dimensions (form, color, and movement) separately. Many different visual pathways and many different areas of the cortex are devoted to visual processing (32 visual areas in the count by Van Essen & DeYoe, 1995 ). Different pathways have cells that are differentially sensitive to color, movement, and orientation. Thus, the visual system analyzes a stimulus into many independent features in specific locations. Such a spatial representation of visual features is called a feature map ( Wolfe, 1994 ), with separate maps for color, orientation, and movement. Thus, if a vertical red bar is moving at a particular location, separate feature maps represent its color as red, its orientation as vertical, and its movement as occurring in that location. As one progresses down the ventral stream (the “what” visual pathway in Figure 2.1 ) one finds neurons that have more complex response functions ( Roe et al., 2012 ). Even in the primary visual cortex there is a distinction between simple cells like those in Figure 2.7 that respond to patterns in specific visual locations and complex cells that respond to similarly simple patterns but in many locations. By the time the ventral stream gets to the inferior temporal cortex, we find cells that respond to complex patterns like hands and faces ( Gross, 2008 ). For example, Figure 2.9 shows the responses of a neuron found in the inferior temporal lobe of a macaque monkey ( Desimone, Albright, Gross, & Bruce, 1984 ). This cell responds to stimuli to the degree that they look like hands and seems somewhat insensitive to the orientation of the hand.

There are many studies like these that show that cortical regions involved in high-level visual processing are activated during the processing of visual imagery. However, the evidence is less clear about activation in the primary visual cortex (areas 17 and 18 in Figure 1.7 ; see also Figure 2.5 ), where visual information first reaches the brain. The O’Craven and Kanwisher (2000) study did find activation in the primary visual cortex during imagery. Such results are important because they suggest that visual imagery includes relatively low-level perceptual processes. However, other studies have not always found activation in the primary visual cortex. For instance, the Roland and Friberg (1985) study illustrated in Figure 4.1 did not find activation in this region (see also Roland, Eriksson, Stone-Elander, & Widen, 1987 ). Kosslyn and Thompson (2003) reviewed 59 brain-imaging studies that looked for activation in early visual areas during imagery. About half of these studies find activation in early visual areas and half do not. Kosslyn and Thompson’s analysis suggests that the studies that find activation in these early visual areas tend to emphasize high-resolution details of the images and tend to focus on shape judgments. For example, Kosslyn et al. (1993) found activation in area 17 in a study where participants were asked to imagine block letters. In one of their experiments, participants were asked to imagine large versus small letters. In the small-letter condition, activity in the visual cortex occurred in a more posterior region, closer to where the center of the visual field is represented. This makes sense because a small image would be more concentrated at the center of the visual field. Imaging studies like these show that perceptual regions of the brain are active when participants engage in mental imagery, but they do not establish whether these regions are actually critical to imagery', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications', 'author': 'John R.

Description - People can focus their attention on nonfoveal parts of the visual field and can change their focus of attention to process what they are interested in. The Neural Basis of Visual Attention It appears that the neural mechanisms underlying visual attention are very similar to those underlying auditory attention. Just as auditory attention directed to one ear enhances the cortical signal from that ear, visual attention directed to a spatial location appears to enhance the cortical signal from that location. If a person attends to a particular spatial location, a distinct neural response (detected using ERP records) in the visual cortex occurs within 70 to 90 ms after the onset of a stimulus. On the other hand, when a person is attending to a particular object (attending to a chair rather than a table, say) rather than to a particular location in space, we do not see a response for more than 200 ms. Thus, it appears to take more effort to direct visual attention on the basis of content than on the basis of physical features, just as is the case with auditory attention. Mangun, Hillyard, and Luck (1993) had participants fixate on the center of a computer screen, then judge the lengths of bars presented in positions different from the fixation location (upper left, lower left, upper right, and lower right). Figure 3.10 shows the distribution of scalp activity detected by ERP when a participant was attending to each of these four different regions of the visual array (while fixating on the center of the screen). Consistent with the topographic organization of the visual cortex, there was greatest activity over the side of the scalp opposite the side of the visual field where the object appeared. Recall from Chapters 1 and 2 (see Figure 2.5 ) that the visual cortex (at the back of the brain) is topographically organized, with each visual field (left or right) represented in the opposite hemisphere', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications', 'author': 'John R.

Consider the following sequence of handwritten digits: Most people effortlessly recognize those digits as 504192. That ease is deceptive. In each hemisphere of our brain, humans have a primary visual cortex, also known as V 1 , containing 140 million neurons, with tens of billions of connections between them. And yet human vision involves not just V 1 , but an entire series of visual cortices – V 2 , V 3 , V 4 , and V 5 – doing progressively more complex image processing. We carry in our heads a supercomputer, tuned by evolution over hundreds of millions of years, and superbly adapted to understand the visual world. Recognizing handwritten digits isn’t easy. Rather, we humans are stupendously, astoundingly good at making sense of what our eyes show us. But nearly all that work is done unconsciously. And so we don’t usually appreciate how tough a problem our visual systems solve. The difficulty of visual pattern recognition becomes apparent if you attempt to write a computer program to recognize digits like those above. What seems easy when we do it ourselves suddenly becomes extremely difficult. Simple intuitions about how we recognize shapes – “a 9 has a loop at the top, and a vertical stroke in the bottom right” – turn out to be not so simple to express algorithmically. When you try to make such rules precise, you quickly get lost in a morass of exceptions and caveats and special cases. It seems hopeless. Neural networks approach the problem in a different way. The idea is to take a large number of handwritten digits, known as training examples, and then develop a system which can learn from those training examples. In other words, the neural network uses the examples to automatically infer rules for recognizing handwritten digits. Furthermore, by increasing the number of training examples, the network can learn more about handwriting, and so improve its accuracy', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'nielsen_neuralnetworksanddeeplearning', 'author': '', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Natural_language_processing\\pdf_material\\nielsen_neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.pdf', 'date_published': '2018-09-11', 'keywords': '', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Natural_language_processing_nielsen_neuralnetworksanddeeplearning_page-1-38.json_chunk_1', 'course': 'Natural_language_processing'}, 'bm25_score': 4.469334125518799, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 1.0618126}, {'id': 'intro_to_cognitive_science_cognitive_psychology_and_its_implications_page-1-851.json_chunk_64', 'text': '. Optic nerve fibers synapse onto cells in subcortical structures, such as the lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus. Both structures are connected to the visual cortex. Description The illustration depicts the visual cortex on the occipital lobe of right and left hemispheres. The nerves from the visual cortex connect to superior colliculus and lateral geniculate nucleus. The nerves from the lateral geniculate nucleus meet the optic chiasm and the ganglion cell axons cross over and go opposite to the corresponding hemispheres. The left halves of both eyes are connected to the left hemisphere and the right halves of both eyes are connected to the right hemisphere. The dashed lines projecting from the eyes toward left and right regions of the brain mark the range of sight. Two ovals are presented at the point where the dashed lines end and overlap in the middle. Once inside the brain, the fibers from the ganglion cells synapse onto cells in various subcortical structures. These subcortical structures (such as the lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus in Figure 2.4 ) are connected to the primary visual cortex (area 17 in Figure 1.7 ). The primary visual cortex is the first cortical area to receive visual input, but there are many other visual areas. Figure 2.5 illustrates the topographic representation of the visual field in the primary visual cortex (as discussed in Chapter 1 ). The fovea receives a disproportionate representation while the peripheral areas receive less representation ( Figure 1.9 illustrates a similar disproportionate neural representation in the somatosensory cortex).

Fraser, 1908.) 333 CHAPTER 10 THE CENTRAL VISUAL SYSTEM thalamus and the primary visual cortex, also called area 17 , V1 , or the striate cortex . We will see that the information funneled through this gniculocortical pathway is processed in parallel by neurons specialized for the analysis of different stimulus attributes. The striate cortex then feeds this information to more than two dozen extrastriate cortical areas in the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes, and many of these appear to be specialized for different types of analysis. Much of what we know about the central visual system was fi rst worked out in the domestic cat and then extended to the rhesus monkey, Macaca mulatta . The macaque monkey, as it is also called, relies heavily on vision for survival in its habitat, as do we humans. In fact, tests of the performance of this primate’s visual system show that in virtually all respects, it rivals that of humans. Thus, although most of this chapter concerns the organization of the macaque visual system most neuroscentists agree that it approximates very closely the situation in our own brain. Visual neuroscience cannot yet explain every aspect of visual peception (Figure 10.1). However, signifi cant progress has been made in answering a basic question: How do neurons represent the different facets of the visual world? By examining those stimuli that make diferent neurons in the visual cortex respond, and how these response properties arise, we begin to see how the brain portrays the visual world around us. THE RETINOFUGAL PROJECTION The neural pathway that leaves the eye, beginning with the optic nerve, is often referred to as the retinofugal projection .

However, in recent years, this assumption has been doubted increasingly, especially in the light of neurophysiological and neuropsychological evidence that suggests the parallel processing of information from the retina through two separate cortical pathways: a so-called ventral pathway that projects from the primary visual cortex (BA17 or V1) into the inferotemporal cortex and a so-called dorsal pathway that projects from the primary visual cortex into the posterior parietal cortex (Fig. 4.2 ). In groundbreaking experiments with monkeys, 4.1 Dissociations of Perception and Action 80 Ungerleider and Mishkin ( 1982 ) have shown that the ventral pathway plays a central role in the recognition of objects and provides information about the identity of objects (hence it is also known as the “what” pathway). The dorsal pathway, in contrast, provides information about the spatial location of objects and allows for the localization of objects in space (“where” pathway). 4.1.2.1 Consequences of Selective Damage to Visual Pathways Neural systems in the ventral processing pathway are specialized in, among other things, the registration and identifi cation of visual stimulus properties like color, form, and texture, but also more complex stimulus confi gurations, such as faces. Therefore, damage to the ventral processing pathway can lead to massive losses in recognition performance and is often associated with visual agnosia . Patients with visual agnosia can often recognize simple visual stimuli, like points of light or lines, but fail to recognize more complicated confi gurations. They also fail to identify the outlines of objects, nor can they associate colors and objects with each other (cf. Box 4.1 ). So, visual agnosia does not infl uence the identifi cation of isolated features of objects but the integration of individual features into a unifi ed and coheent perceptual impression (“percept”).

Neurons are by no means the majority of cells in the nervous system. There are many other cell types, such as glial cells, whose main function is thought to be supportive of the neurons. The term “cerebral cortex” is widely used to refer just to the neocortex, and I have largely adopted that usage in this book, as well as using just “cortex” as a short way of referring to the cerebral cortex or neocortex. In places where the distinction is important, I have used the more specific “neocortex.” 1 2 3 Chapter 2 Perception Our bodies are bristling with sensory receptors — neurons that detect sights, sounds, smells, and physical contact. Billions of neurons process sensory information and deliver what they find to the higher centers in the brain. This chapter will focus on visual perception and, to a lesser extent, on audition as it is involved in the perception of speech — the two most important perceptual systems for the human species. The chapter will address the following questions: How does the brain extract information from the visual signal? How is visual information organized into objects? How are the sounds of speech (phonemes) recognized? How are visual and speech patterns recognized? How does context affect pattern recognition? Visual Perception in the Brain Humans have a big neural investment in processing visual information. This is illustrated in Figure 2.1 , which shows some of the cortical structures devoted to processing information from vision and hearing. This investment in vision is part of our “inheritance” as primates, which have evolved to devote as much as 50% of their brains to visual processing ( Barton, 1998 ). The enormous investment underlies the human ability to see the world. Figure 2.1 Some of the Cortical Structures Involved in Vision and Audition.

please explain shared attention,"Nice question!

Based on the provided context, shared attention refers to the mutual understanding and direction of attention between interacting agents involved in a communicative situation. This phenomenon is characterized by the coordination of gaze-following, pointing, and verbal language use (e.g., Carpenter et al., 1998; Tomasello, 1999; Talmy, 2000) that enables them to share information and meaning.

In particular, shared attention involves profiling and structuring joint-attentional scenes through linguistic contributions, which are often underdetermined without contextual specification (Raczaszek-Leonardi & Kelso, 2008). For instance, in the example provided, the utterance ""Are you picking them up today?"" only makes sense within a specific situational context that specifies the intended meaning of the personal pronouns ""you"" and ""them"", as well as the verb ""to pick up"".","[""Nice question!\n\nBased on the provided context, shared attention refers to the mutual understanding and direction of attention between interacting agents involved in a communicative situation.

While the practice of gaze-following and pointing has been found to subserve joint attention in pre-linguistic infant-adult interactions (Carpenter et al ., 1998), in later stages of development verbal language lends itself as another tool for directing and sharing attention (Tomasello, 1999; Talmy, 2000). The function of language as profiling and structuring joint attentional scenes, rather than representing them, finds support in the observation that the linguistic contribution to the overall meaning of communicative situations is often largely underdetermined (Raczaszek-Leonardi and Kelso, 2008). Consider the utterance: ‘Are you picking them up today?’ Though the sentence is composed of high frequency words in a conventional interrogative construction, and at first glance seems perfectly meaningful, in fact the utterance makes little sense when detached from the situational context in which it is spoken (Wallentin et al ., 2006). Is it about kids being collected from daycare? Or little pearls that have fallen on the floor during a creative workshop? Or is it about trafficking of illegal drugs? We thus need contextual specification of (at least) the personal pronouns ‘you’ and ‘them’, not to mention the verb ‘to pick up’, in order to grasp the intended meaning of the utterance. To the interacting agents involved in the discourse, the specifications of intended meanings are certainly accessible and present in their shared situational context. What is at stake in the sentence is thus merely a (re)organization and profiling of the already existing state of affairs (e.g. ‘is it me or you ?’, ‘is it today ?’, etc)', 'distance': 0.31267720460891724, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 0.9266132}]"

what is an r function for ordinal regression,"A question about statistics in R!

According to the provided context from your Cognitive Science syllabus, there isn't a specific answer about an R function for ordinal regression. The context seems more focused on deep learning and natural language processing.

However, I can provide you with some general information. In R, you can use the `ordinal` package to perform ordinal regression. One of the key functions in this package is `ordinal()`, which fits an ordinal regression model to your data.

# Load your data
data <- ...

# Fit an ordinal regression model
model <- ordinal(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data)

# Print the summary of the model
summary(model)

However, we now set loss = 'categorical_crossentropy ' , which extends the binary cross-entropy objective function to outcomes with more than two categories. More formally, the categorical cross-entropy is the log-likelihood of an outcome that follows a multinomial distribution with number of cells equal to the number of outcome categories, cell probabilities predicted by the fitted model, and trial size one. It is the same objective function used for fitting ordinal regression models (Kutner et al., 2004). We fitted and tested the model: history = cnn %>% fit ( train_data$X, as.matrix (train_data$y), epochs = 50, batch_size = 7 ) cnn %>% evaluate (test_data$X, as.matrix (test_data$y)) The first input to fit () is a 683 ◊ 48 ◊ 48 ◊ 1 tensor of training set images and the second input is an outcome vector. We fitted the model for 50 epochs and randomly sampled 7 images for each fitting iteration. Finally, we evaluated our deep CNN on a test set of 30 percent of observations. We include a full R script for our analysis as online supplemental material. Our fitted model obtained a predictive accuracy of 0 . 84 on a test set of 30 percent of observations, suggesting that our images of faces contain objective information that can be used to predict their emotional content. We could possibly increase our model’s predictive accuracy even further either by collecting more data (which could be expensive) or by fitting our model to one of many publicly available large facial expression data sets (e.g., facial expression databases can be found at https://web.archive.org/web/20180325205102/http://emotion-research.net/wiki/Databases or https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~cvrl/database/other_facial_expression.htm) then refining the fitted parameters on our smaller data set using a transfer learning approach.

The conclusion is thus that apes and young human chidren both understand in the same basic way (in simple situations) that individuals pursue a goal in a persistent manner until they have reached it—and they understand the goal not as the result produced in the external envronment, but rather as the actor’s internal representation Primate Intentional Communication 47 of the state of the world she wishes to bring about. They also understand that the actor chooses an action to pursue a goal “rationally” in the sense that they consider the actor’s reasons for doing what he is doing. Second, great apes (most of the research is again with chimpanzees) also understand that others have percetions. Evidence is as follows (see Tomasello and Call 2006 for a review): • When a human peers behind a barrier, apes move over to get a better viewing angle to look behind it as well (Tomasello, Hare, and Agnetta 1999; Bräuer et al. 2006; see Moll and Tomasello 2004 for a similar study with human infants). • When a human’s gaze is directed toward a barrier and there is also an object further in that same direction, apes look only to the barrier and not to the object—unless the barrier has a window in it, in which case they look to the object (Okamoto-Barth, Call, and Tomasello 2007; see Caron et al. 2002 for similar fi ndings with human infants). • When apes beg a human for food, they take into account whether the human can see their gesture (Kaminski, Call, and Tomasello 2004; Liebal, Pika, Call, and Tomasello 2004). • When chimpanzees compete with one another for food they take into account whether their competitor can see the contested food (Hare et al. 2000; Hare, Call, Tomasello 2001), and even on occasion attempt to conceal their 48 Chapter 2 approach from a competitor (Hare, Call, Tomasello 2006; Melis, Call, and Tomasello 2006)', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Origins of Human Communication', 'author': 'User', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\cognition_and_communication\\pdf_material\\origins_of_human_communication__michael_tomasello.pdf', 'date_published': '2008-08-14', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'cognition_and_communication_origins_of_human_communication_page-13-55.json_chunk_28', 'course': 'cognition_and_communication'}, 'bm25_score': 9.18919563293457, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 4.1023407}, {'id': 'cognition_and_communication_origins_of_human_communication_page-13-55.json_chunk_29', 'text': '. 2000; Hare, Call, Tomasello 2001), and even on occasion attempt to conceal their 48 Chapter 2 approach from a competitor (Hare, Call, Tomasello 2006; Melis, Call, and Tomasello 2006). The conclusion is thus that apes and young human chidren both understand in the same basic way (in simple situations) that individuals perceive things in the world and react to them—and they understand that the content of the other’s perception is something different from their own. The last-cited competition experiments are especially important because they demonstrate that chimpanzees do not just understand goals and perception separately, but rather understand how they are interrelated in the basic logic of intentional action: agents want certain envronmental states to obtain (have goals); agents see the world and so can assess the situation with respect to the desired goal state; and agents do things when they peceive that the environment is not in the desired goal state. This kind of understanding of intentional action supports a basic form of practical reasoning that enables individals to understand and predict what others are doing and will do, even in novel circumstances. Thus, in the Hare et al. competition experiments, participants understand that if their competitor can see his goal (the food) he will pursue it, whereas if he cannot see it he will not pursue it; and conversely, if the competitor sees something that is not its goal (e.g., a rock), he will not pursue that. And they can understand basic things about opportunities and obstacles to goals for others in novel situations—for Primate Intentional Communication 49 example, when the other has a free path to food or his path is blocked—and how this affects their behavioral choices', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Origins of Human Communication', 'author': 'User', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\cognition_and_communication\\pdf_material\\origins_of_human_communication__michael_tomasello.pdf', 'date_published': '2008-08-14', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'cognition_and_communication_origins_of_human_communication_page-13-55.json_chunk_29', 'course': 'cognition_and_communication'}, 'bm25_score': 6.388096809387207, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 3.014637}]"

"but i remember a professor speaking about PCA, what is that and how is it related?","A great follow-up question!

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is indeed another important method for compacting large datasets in cognitive neuroscience. In the context of fMRI data analysis, PCA helps to identify the most important patterns or modes in the data by transforming the original variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components.

These principal components are ordered based on the amount of variance they explain, and typically only the top few components capture the majority of the information. By retaining these key components, we can reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving most of its essential features.

So, PCA is closely related to methods like ICA mentioned earlier. Both aim to decompose complex datasets into simpler, more interpretable patterns or components. While ICA focuses on finding independent components, PCA concentrates on retaining the most informative dimensions in the data.

More IPython Resources | 31 CHAPTER 2 Introduction to NumPy This chapter, along with Chapter 3 , outlines techniques for effectively loading, stor‐ ing, and manipulating in-memory data in Python. The topic is very broad: datasets can come from a wide range of sources and a wide range of formats, including collec‐ tions of documents, collections of images, collections of sound clips, collections of numerical measurements, or nearly anything else. Despite this apparent heterogene‐ ity, it will help us to think of all data fundamentally as arrays of numbers. For example, images—particularly digital images—can be thought of as simply twdimensional arrays of numbers representing pixel brightness across the area. Sound clips can be thought of as one-dimensional arrays of intensity versus time. Text can be converted in various ways into numerical representations, perhaps binary digits rep‐ resenting the frequency of certain words or pairs of words. No matter what the data are, the first step in making them analyzable will be to transform them into arrays of numbers. (We will discuss some specific examples of this process later in “Feature Engineering” on page 375 .) For this reason, efficient storage and manipulation of numerical arrays is absolutely fundamental to the process of doing data science. We’ll now take a look at the special‐ ized tools that Python has for handling such numerical arrays: the NumPy package and the Pandas package (discussed in Chapter 3 .) This chapter will cover NumPy in detail. NumPy (short for Numerical Python ) pro‐ vides an efficient interface to store and operate on dense data buffers. In some ways, NumPy arrays are like Python’s built-in list type, but NumPy arrays provide much more efficient storage and data operations as the arrays grow larger in size', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'research_paper', 'title': 'Python Data Science Handbook', 'author': 'Jake VanderPlas', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Natural_language_processing\\pdf_material\\Python Data Science Handbook (Jake VanderPlas).pdf', 'date_published': '2016-11-16', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Natural_language_processing_python_data_science_handbook.json_chunk_48', 'course': 'Natural_language_processing'}, 'bm25_score': 6.541787147521973, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 0.3454675}]"

Can you provide me some arguments as to why i should move towards analyses with bayesian inference as aposed to p-value inference?,"A question that delves into the realm of statistical inference!

In the context of Cognitive Neuroscience, Bayesian inference is an increasingly popular approach for data analysis. Here are some arguments in favor of adopting Bayesian inference over traditional p-value based approaches:

1. **Interpretability**: Bayesian inference provides a more interpretable framework for statistical inference. By using Bayes' theorem to update the probability of a hypothesis given the data, you can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying relationships and mechanisms.
2. **Handling uncertainty**: Bayesian inference naturally accommodates uncertainty by incorporating prior knowledge and updating it based on the data. This leads to more robust and flexible models that better capture the complexities of real-world phenomena.
3. **Avoiding false positives**: P-values are often misused, leading to an overabundance of false positive results. Bayesian inference can help mitigate this issue by providing a more nuanced understanding of the evidence and reducing the likelihood of Type I errors.
4. **Model selection**: Bayesian inference provides a straightforward way to compare and select models based on their relative support from the data. This allows you to choose the most plausible model(s) rather than relying solely on p-values.
5. **Flexibility in modeling**: Bayesian inference enables the use of complex, nuanced models that can capture intricate relationships and nonlinearities. This flexibility is particularly valuable when working with high-dimensional or multivariate data.

Here are some arguments in favor of adopting Bayesian inference over traditional p-value based approaches:\n\n1. **Interpretability**: Bayesian inference provides a more interpretable framework for statistical inference. By using Bayes' theorem to update the probability of a hypothesis given the data, you can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying relationships and mechanisms.\n2. **Handling uncertainty**: Bayesian inference naturally accommodates uncertainty by incorporating prior knowledge and updating it based on the data. This leads to more robust and flexible models that better capture the complexities of real-world phenomena.\n3. **Avoiding false positives**: P-values are often misused, leading to an overabundance of false positive results. Bayesian inference can help mitigate this issue by providing a more nuanced understanding of the evidence and reducing the likelihood of Type I errors.\n4. **Model selection**: Bayesian inference provides a straightforward way to compare and select models based on their relative support from the data. This allows you to choose the most plausible model(s) rather than relying solely on p-values.\n5. **Flexibility in modeling**: Bayesian inference enables the use of complex, nuanced models that can capture intricate relationships and nonlinearities.

can you tell me about Hick's Law?,"Hick's Law is a fundamental concept in Cognitive Science that explains how the complexity and number of options in an interface or system affect the user's cognitive load. The law, named after its discoverer, William Edmund Hick, states that as the number of choices increases, the time it takes to make a decision also increases.

In simpler terms, Hick's Law suggests that when we're presented with too many options, our brains become overwhelmed, and it becomes harder to make a decision. This is because our working memory (the mental ""workspace"" where information is stored for processing) has a limited capacity. When the number of choices exceeds this capacity, our brains struggle to keep up, leading to increased cognitive load and potentially frustration.

This principle has significant implications for user experience (UX) design. It highlights the importance of simplicity, clarity, and reducing the complexity of interfaces to facilitate easier decision-making. By minimizing the number of options and promoting a more intuitive navigation, designers can reduce cognitive load and improve the overall user experience.

In the context of UX design, Hick's Law is often used to inform decisions about menu structures, button placement, and overall interface simplicity. For example, consider a social media platform with multiple options for sharing content (e.g., text-only post, image post, video post). By reducing the number of options and making it clearer which option is most relevant, designers can reduce cognitive load and make it easier for users to share their content.

I hope this explanation helps! Do you have any specific questions or scenarios you'd like me to explore regarding Hick's Law?","[""Hick's Law is a fundamental concept in cognitive science and user experience (UX) design. It states that as the number of options or choices increases, the time it takes to make a decision also increases.\n\nThe law was first proposed by British psychologist William Edmund Hick in 1952. Hick found that when people are faced with more options, they need more time to make a decision because their brains have to work harder to process and evaluate all the available choices.\n\nIn essence, Hick's Law suggests that as the complexity of an interface increases (i.e., more features, options, or choices), the user's cognitive load also increases. Cognitive load refers to the mental effort required to understand and use a system. When users are presented with too many options, they may experience mental fatigue, leading to slower decision-making times and ultimately, a poor user experience.\n\nThe implications of Hick's Law are significant for UX designers and developers. To create effective interfaces, we should strive to present users with the right amount of information, at the right time, in the most intuitive way possible. This can be achieved by:\n\n1. Simplifying interfaces: Reduce the number of options or choices to minimize cognitive load.\n2. Organizing information: Use clear categories, labels, and hierarchies to help users quickly find what they need.\n3. Providing contextual clues: Offer hints, tooltips, or other visual aids to support user understanding and decision-making.\n4. Streamlining navigation: Make it easy for users to navigate through the interface by reducing the number of steps required to achieve their goals.\n\nExamples of Hick's Law in action can be found in various areas, such as:\n\n1. Remote controls: As I mentioned earlier, the complexity of TV remotes has increased over time, leading to a need for simplification.\n2. Online shopping: When faced with too many product options or overwhelming search results, users may struggle to make decisions due to cognitive overload.\n3.

In other words, when there are more choices available, it takes longer to decide which one to select.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nImagine you're standing in front of a large menu with many different dishes. The more options you see, the harder it becomes to choose just one. This is because your brain has to process and compare all those options, considering factors like taste, nutrition, price, and so on. As the number of choices grows, the mental effort required to make a decision increases, leading to slower decision-making times.\n\n**What are the implications?**\n\nHick's Law has significant implications for user experience design:\n\n1. **Simplification is key**: When designing interfaces or processes, it's essential to minimize the number of options and simplify the choices available. This reduces cognitive load and makes it easier for users to make decisions.\n2. **Contextual clues are crucial**: Providing contextual information or hints can help reduce uncertainty and make it easier for users to choose from a smaller set of options.\n3. **Prioritize essential features**: When designing complex systems, prioritize the most critical features and hide less important ones to reduce cognitive load.\n\n**Examples in action**\n\nWe've seen Hick's Law at work in various examples, such as:\n\n1. **Remote controls**: As TV remotes became more feature-rich, users experienced increased complexity and decision-making times.\n2. **Online menus**: The more options available on a menu, the longer it takes to decide which dish to choose.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nHick's Law is an essential principle in cognitive science and user experience design, highlighting the importance of simplification, contextual cues, and prioritizing essential features.

The more options you have, the longer it takes to make a decision.\n2. **The relationship between options and decision-making time is exponential**: In other words, as the number of options grows, the decision-making time grows exponentially faster.

This observation directly relates to Hick’s law, which predicts that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. Not only is this principle fundamental to decision making, but it’s critcal to how people perceive and process the user interfaces we create. We’ll look at some examples of how this principle relates to design, but first let’s look at its origins. Origins Hick’s law was formulated in 1952 by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman, who were examining the relationship between the number of stiuli present and an individual’s reaction time to any given stimulus. What they found was that increasing the number of choices available logarithmically increses decision time. In other words, people take longer to make a decision when given more options to choose from. It turns out there is an actual formula to reresent this relationship: RT = a + b log 2 ( n ) ( Figure 3-1 ). This formula calculates response time (RT) based on the number of stimuli present ( n ) and two arbitrary measurable constants that depend on the task ( a , b ). Fortunately, we don’t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it means. The concept is straightforward when applied to design: the time it takes for users to interact with an interface directly correlates to the nuber of options available to interact with. This implies that complex or busy intefaces result in longer decision times for users, because they must first process the options that are available to them and then choose which is the most relevant in relation to their goal. When an interface is too busy, actions are unclear or difficult to identify, and critical information is hard to find, a larger amount of brain power is required to find what we are looking for. This leads us to our key concept for Hick’s law: cognitive load.

Key Takeaways • Minimize choices when response times are critical to increase decision time. • Break complex tasks into smaller steps in order to decrease cogntive load. • Avoid overwhelming users by highlighting recommended options. • Use progressive onboarding to minimize cognitive load for new users. • Be careful not to simplify to the point of abstraction. Overview One of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present it in a way that doesn’t overwhelm the people who use the products and services we design. We do this because we understand, almost instinctively, that redundancy and excessiveness create confusion. This confusion is probleatic when it comes to creating products and services that feel intuitive. Instead we should enable people to quickly and easily accomplish their goals. We risk causing confusion when we don’t completely understand the goals and costraints of the people using the product or service. Ultimately, our objective is to 23 understand what the user seeks to accomplish so that we can reduce or eliminate anything that doesn’t contribute to them successfully achieving their goal(s). We in essence strive to simplify complexity through efficiency and elegance. What is neither efficient nor elegant is when an interface provides too many options. This is a clear indication that those who created the product or service do not entirely understand the needs of the user. Complexity extends beyond just the user interface; it can be applied to processes as well. The absence of a distintive and clear call to action, unclear information architecture, unnecessary steps, too many choices or too much information—all of these can be obstacles to users seeking to perform a specific task. This observation directly relates to Hick’s law, which predicts that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available', 'distance': 0.3428076207637787, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 2.7228253}, {'id': 'Human_computer_interaction_laws_of_ux_page-23-34.json_chunk_3', 'metadata': {'author': 'Jon  Yablonski;', 'chunk_id': 'Human_computer_interaction_laws_of_ux_page-23-34.json_chunk_3', 'course': 'Human_computer_interaction', 'date_published': '2020-04-21', 'document_type': 'book', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Human_computer_interaction\\pdf_material\\Laws of UX.pdf', 'title': 'Laws of UX'}, 'text': '. This leads us to our key concept for Hick’s law: cognitive load. Figure 3-1. Diagram representing Hick’s law PSYCHOLOGY CONCEPT Cognitive Load When engaging with a digital product or service, a user must first learn how it works and then determine how to find the information they are looking for. Understanding how to use the navigation (or sometimes even finding it), processing the page layout, interacting with UI elements, and entering information into forms all require mental resources. While this learning process is happening, the user must also maintain focus on what they intended to do in the first place. Depending on how easy an interface is to use, the latter can be quite a challenge. The amount of mental resources needed to understand and interact with an interface is known as cognitive load . You can think of it like memory in a phone or laptop: run too many apps and the battery begins to drain and the device slows down, or worst of all, it crashes. The amount of processing power available determines performance, and this depends on memory—a finite resource. Our brains work similarly: when the amount of information coming in exceeds the space we have available, we struggle mentally to keep up— tasks become more difficult, details are missed, and we begin to feel overwhelmed. Our working memory, the buffer space ( Figure 3-2 ) available for storing information relevant to the current task, has a spcific number of slots in which to store information. If the tasks at hand require more space than is available, we begin to lose information from our working memory to accommodate this new information. Figure 3-2. Working memory buffer illustration This becomes problematic when the information lost is critical to the task that someone wishes to perform or is related to the information they want to find. Tasks will become more difficult and users might start to feel overwhelmed, ultimately leading to frustration or even task abadonment—both symptoms of a bad user experience', 'distance': 0.3544299602508545, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 2.571424}, {'id': 'Human_computer_interaction_laws_of_ux_page-23-34.json_chunk_9', 'metadata': {'author': 'Jon  Yablonski;', 'chunk_id': 'Human_computer_interaction_laws_of_ux_page-23-34.json_chunk_9', 'course': 'Human_computer_interaction', 'date_published': '2020-04-21', 'document_type': 'book', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Human_computer_interaction\\pdf_material\\Laws of UX.pdf', 'title': 'Laws of UX'}, 'text': '. This practice is even more critical when using icons for important elements such as navigation ( Figure 3-9 ). The addition of text labels effectively reduces the abstration of the icons alone by including additional information to help convey meaning and increase usability. Figure 3-9. Text labels accompany icons in the navigation on the Twitter web app (source: Twitter, 2019) Conclusion Hick’s law is a key concept in user experience design because it’s an underlying factor in everything we do. When an interface is too busy, actions are unclear or difficult to identify, and critical information is hard to find, a higher cognitive load is placed on users. Simplifying an interface or process helps to reduce the mental strain, but we must be sure to add contextual clues to help users identify the options available and determine the relevance of the information available to the tasks they wish to perform. It’s important to remember that each user has a goal, whether it’s to buy a product, understand something, or simply learn more about the content. I find the process of reduction, or eliminating any element that isn’t helping the user achieve their goal, a critical part of the design process. The less they have to think about what they need to do to reach their goal, the more likely it is they will achieve it. We touched on the role of memory in user experience design with cognitive load. Next up, we’ll further explore memory and its importance with Miller’s law.', 'distance': 0.3912273943424225, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 2.5449162}, {'id': 'Human_computer_interaction_laws_of_ux_page-23-34.json_chunk_4', 'metadata': {'author': 'Jon  Yablonski;', 'chunk_id': 'Human_computer_interaction_laws_of_ux_page-23-34.json_chunk_4', 'course': 'Human_computer_interaction', 'date_published': '2020-04-21', 'document_type': 'book', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Human_computer_interaction\\pdf_material\\Laws of UX.pdf', 'title': 'Laws of UX'}, 'text': '. Tasks will become more difficult and users might start to feel overwhelmed, ultimately leading to frustration or even task abadonment—both symptoms of a bad user experience. Examples Now that we have an understanding of Hick’s law and cognitive load, let’s take a look at some examples that demonstrate this principle. There are examples of Hick’s law in action everywhere, but we’ll start with a common one: remote controls. As the number of features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually, we ended up with remotes so complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant amount of mental processing. This led to the phnomenon known as “grandparent-friendly remotes.” By taping off everything except for the essential buttons, grandkids were able to improve the usability of remotes for their loved ones, and they also did us all the favor of sharing them online ( Figure 3-3 ). In contrast, today we have smart TV remotes: the streamlined cousins of the previous examples, simplifying the controls to only those that are absolutely neessary ( Figure 3-4 ). The result is a remote that doesn’t require a substantial amount of working memory and therefore incurs much less cognitive load. The complexity is transferred to the TV interface itself, where information can be effectively organized and progressively disclosed within menus. Figure 3-3. Modified TV remotes that simplify the “interface” (sources: Sam Weller via Twitter, 2015 [left]; Luke Hannon via Twitter, 2016 [right]) Figure 3-4. A smart TV remote, which simplifies the controls to only those absolutely necessary (source: Digital Trends, 2018) Now that we’ve seen some examples of Hick’s law at work in the physical world, let’s shift our focus to the digital. As we’ve seen already, the number of choices available can have a direct impact on the time it takes to make a decision', 'distance': 0.34500670433044434, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 2.3939946}]"

There is evidence that prefrontal regions are particularly important in the direction of central cognition, often known as executive control . The prefrontal cortex is that portion of the frontal cortex anterior to the premotor region (the premotor region is area 6 in Figure 1.7 ). Just as damage to parietal regions results in deficits in the deployment of perceptual attention, damage to prefrontal regions results in deficits of executive control. Patients with such damage often seem totally driven by the stimulus and fail to control their behavior according to their intentions. A patient who sees a comb on the table may be unable to inhibit the action of picking it up and beginning to comb her hair; another who sees a pair of glasses cannot help putting them on, even if he already has a pair on his face. Patients with damage to prefrontal regions show marked deficits in the Stroop task and often cannot refrain from saying the word rather than naming the color ( Janer & Pardo, 1991 ). Two prefrontal regions shown in Figure 3.2 seem particularly important in executive control. One is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) , which is the upper portion of the prefrontal cortex. It is called dorsolateral because it is high (dorsal) and to the side (lateral). The second region is the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) , which is folded under the visible surface of the brain along the midline. The DLPFC seems particularly important in the setting of intentions and the control of behavior. For instance, it is highly active during the simultaneous performance of dual tasks such as those whose results are reported in Figures 3.23 and 3.24 ( Szameitat, Schubert, Muller, & von Cramon, 2002 ). The ACC seems particularly active when people must monitor conflict between competing tendencies. For instance, brain-imaging studies show that it is highly active in Stroop trials when a participant must name the color of a color word printed in an ink of conflicting color ( Pardo, Pardo, Janer, & Raichle, 1990 )', 'distance': 0.29847967624664307, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 4.6340837}, {'id': 'cognitive_neuroscience_bear_2016_neuroscience_exploring_the_brain_page-823-864.json_chunk_17', 'metadata': {'author': '', 'chunk_id': 'cognitive_neuroscience_bear_2016_neuroscience_exploring_the_brain_page-823-864.json_chunk_17', 'course': 'cognitive_neuroscience', 'date_published': '2015-01-14', 'document_type': 'book', 'keywords': '', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\cognitive_neuroscience\\pdf_material\\Bear_2016_Neuroscience_Exploring_the_Brain.pdf', 'title': 'Bear_2016_Neuroscience_Exploring_the_Brain'}, 'text': '. Then, after Central sulcus Prefrontal cortex ▲ FIGURE 24.6 Prefrontal cortex. The brain rostral to the central sulcus is the frontal lobe. The prefrontal cortex is the anterior portion of the frontal lobe that receives afferents from the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus. 832 PART FOUR THE CHANGING BRAIN ten correct card placements have been made, the sorting category is changed, and the subject starts over again. To perform well on this test, a person must use memory of previous cards and errors in order to plan the next card placement. People with prefrontal lesions have great diffi - culty on this task when the sorting category is changed; they continue to sort according to a rule that no longer applies. It appears that they have a working memory defi cit that limits their ability to make use of recent information to change their behavior. The same kind of defi cit is seen in other tasks. For example, a person with a prefrontal lesion might be asked to trace a path through a maze drawn on a piece of paper. Although the patient understands the task, he or she will repeatedly make the same mistakes, returning to blind alleys. In other words, these patients do not learn from their recent experience in the same way as a normal person, suggesting a working memory defi cit. The neurons in prefrontal cortex have a variety of response types, some of which may refl ect a role in working memory. Figure 24.8 shows two response patterns obtained while a monkey performed a delayeresponse task. The neuron in the top trace responded while the animal fi rst saw the food wells, was unresponsive during the delay interval, and responded again when the animal saw the food wells again (Figure 24.8a). The response of the neuron simply correlates with visual stimulation. More interesting is the response pattern of the other neuron, which fi red only during the delay interval (Figure 24.8b). This cell was not directly actvated by the stimuli in the fi rst or second interval in which the monkey saw the food wells', 'distance': 0.2623138427734375, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 4.3512764}, {'id': 'intro_to_cognitive_science_cognitive_psychology_and_its_implications_page-1-851.json_chunk_33', 'metadata': {'author': 'John R.

Anderson).pdf', 'title': 'Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications'}, 'text': '. The front portion, called the prefrontal cortex , is thought to control higher-level processes, such as planning. The frontal portion of the brain is disproportionately larger in primates than in most other mammals, and among primates, humans are distinguished by having disproportionately larger anterior portions of the prefrontal cortex (area 10 in Figure 1.7 ) ( Semendeferi, Armstrong, Schleicher, Zilles, & Van Hoesen, 2001 ). Figure 1.7 Some of the 52 Distinct Regions of the Cerebral Cortex Identified by Brodmann, Based on Cell Structure and Arrangement. Most of the numbered regions missing from this figure (areas 12–16, 23–36, and 48–51) are wrapped inside the brain and so are not visible in this exterior view. Description The Brodman regions are labeled from 1 to 52 except the areas 12 to 16, 23 to 36, and 48 to 51. The regions are colored and numbered. The regions 1, 5, 21, 42, 43, and 44 are colored in dark green. The regions 2, 4, 19, 11 are colored in red. The regions 3, 6, 11, 37, and 46 are colored in yellow. The regions 9, 17, 20, 40, and 52 are colored in blue. The regions 10, 39, and 18 are colored in light green. The regions 7, 8, 38, 41, and 45 are colored in pink. The region 22 is colored in purple. The neocortex is not the only region that plays a significant role in higher-level cognition. Many important circuits go from the cortex to subcortical structures and back again. A particularly significant group of subcortical structures is the limbic system, which is at the border between the cortex and lower structures. Among the structures making up the limbic system are the amygdala and the hippocampus (both of which are located inside the temporal lobe in each hemisphere). As we will see in later discussions, the amygdala is involved in emotional responses. The hippocampus appears to be critical to human memory; damage to the hippocampus and to other nearby structures produces severe amnesia, as we will see in Chapter 7', 'distance': 0.29290735721588135, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 3.5906758}, {'id': 'perception_and_action_hommel_2016_human_action_control___from_intentions_to_movements_page-11-42.json_chunk_42', 'metadata': {'author': 'Unknown', 'chunk_id': 'perception_and_action_hommel_2016_human_action_control___from_intentions_to_movements_page-11-42.json_chunk_42', 'course': 'perception_and_action', 'date_published': '2016-03-30', 'document_type': 'book', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\perception_and_action\\pdf_material\\Hommel_2016_Human action control _ from intentions to movements.pdf', 'title': 'Hommel_2016_Human action control _ from intentions to movements'}, 'text': '. Such a system can play a decisive role in the evaluation and selection of actions, and bias the action alternative that offers the greatest reward. 2.6 Prefrontal Cortex The frontal and in particular the prefrontal cortex are relatively voluminous in humans as compared to other species. For example, in dogs, the frontal cortex makes up about 7 % of the cortex, in monkeys about 17 %, and in humans, more than 30 %. Until fairly recently, this part of the brain was considered to be quite mysterious. By now, however, it has become clear that the neuronal populations of the frontal cortex are not just involved with the primary processing of light and sound stimuli, olfaction, taste, and tactile sensations, but mainly with so-called executive functions . When a human develops plans, makes judgments, forms intentions and transforms them into actions, then the frontal cortex is active. Besides this, the frontal cortex is crucial for working memory . This is a type of short-term storage that is required, for example, when people converse; to understand a spoken sentence, one must recall at the end what was said at the beginning. Such short-term memory is also required at a party, where one should remember who is already greeted, and who is yet to be greeted. More importantly, the frontal cortex checks the processes that occur on the way from intention to action, and recognizes posible errors . Even before you put sugar (instead of grated Parmesan cheese) on your spaghetti, your frontal cortex starts corrective measures and steers your hand away from the sugar and towards the Parmesan cheese. That the frontal region of the human brain is involved with intentions, and their conversion into actions, is corroborated by people with damage to this region. They often act thoughtlessly and prematurely, often change plans, ignore important infomation, and often commit errors without noticing it. Unless motor areas are affected, these patients are not noticeably or visibly disabled', 'distance': 0.28512832522392273, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 3.2321656}, {'id': 'intro_to_cognitive_science_cognitive_psychology_and_its_implications_page-1-851.json_chunk_391', 'metadata': {'author': 'John R.

Anderson).pdf', 'title': 'Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications'}, 'text': '. It is generally thought that in addition to these specific functions, the prefrontal cortex also plays a major role in the overall organization of behavior. The regions of the prefrontal cortex that we have discussed so far tend to be ventral (toward the bottom) and posterior (toward the back), and many of these regions are left lateralized. In contrast, dorsal (toward the top), anterior (toward the front), and bilateral prefrontal structures tend to be more involved in the organization of behavior. Goel and Grafman (2000) describe a patient, P.F., who suffered damage to his right anterior prefrontal cortex as the result of a stroke. Like many patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex, P.F. appears normal and even intelligent, scoring in the superior range on an intelligence test. Nonetheless, despite these surface appearances of normality, P.F. shows profound intellectual deficits. He had been a successful architect before his stroke but was forced to retire because he had lost his ability to design; he was then only able to find work as a draftsman. As part of their study, Goel and Grafman gave P.F. a problem that involved redesigning their laboratory space. Although he was able to speak coherently about the problem, he was unable to make any real progress on the solution (a comparably trained architect without brain damage achieved a good solution in a couple of hours). It seems that the stroke affected only P.F.’s most highly developed intellectual abilities.

Figure 6.1 Brain Structures Involved in the Creation, Storage, and Retrieval of Memories. Prefrontal regions are responsible for the creation and retrieval of memories. The hippocampus and surrounding structures in the temporal cortex are responsible for the permanent storage of memories. Description The cerebral cortex covering the front part of the frontal lobe is labeled prefrontal cortex, small curvy region in the right and left hemispheres near the center of the brain is labeled hippocampus, and a region beneath the lateral fissure of the cerebral hemispheres is labeled temporal cortex. These prefrontal regions exhibit laterality effects similar to those noted at the beginning of Chapter 5 ( Gabrieli, 2001 ). Specifically, study of verbal material tends to engage the left hemisphere more than the right hemisphere, whereas study of pictorial material tends to engage the right hemisphere more. Human memory depends heavily on prefrontal structures of the brain for the creation and retrieval of memories and on temporal structures for the permanent storage of these memories. Sensory Memory Before reaching the structures in Figure 6.1 , information must be processed by perceptual systems, and these systems display a brief memory. There has been extensive research into the nature of these brief sensory memories. Visual Sensory Memory Many studies of visual sensory memory have used a procedure in which participants are presented with a visual array of items, such as the letters shown in Figure 6.2 , for a brief period of time (e.g., 50 ms). When asked to recall the items, participants are typically able to correctly report three, four, five, or at most six items. One might think that only this much material can be held in visual memory — yet participants report that they were aware of more items but the items faded before they could attend to them and report them.

Goldman-Rakic (1992) examined monkey performance on other tasks that require maintaining other types of information over a delay interval. In one task, monkeys had to remember different objects. For example, the animal would have to remember to select a red circle and not a green square. It appears that a different area of the prefrontal cortex is involved in this type of task. Different neurons in this area will fire depending on whether a red circle or a green square is being remembered. Goldman-Rakic speculated that the prefrontal cortex is parceled into many small regions, each of which is responsible for remembering a different kind of information. Like many neuroscience studies, these experiments are correlational — they show a relationship between neural activity and memory function, but they do not show that the neural activity is essential for the memory function', 'distance': 0.27055805921554565, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 2.3310847}, {'id': 'intro_to_cognitive_science_cognitive_psychology_and_its_implications_page-1-851.json_chunk_116', 'metadata': {'author': 'John R.

Description The regions and their functions are as follows: A region in the prefrontal cortex is labeled dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Function: directs central cognition; a region in the frontal lobe located in the posterior precentral gyrus immediately anterior to the central sulcus is labeled motor cortex. Function: control hands. A region between dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and motor cortex located in the front of the corpus callosum, in the medial frontal lobe is labeled anterior cingulate (midline structure). Function: monitors conflict. Two arrows from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulated points to motor cortex; a region behind the frontal lobe, in front of the occipital lobe, and above the temporal lobe is labeled parietal cortex. Function: attends to locations and objects; a region in the primary visual cortex is labeled extrastriate cortex. Function: processes visual information; a region located on the superior temporal gyrus in the temporal lobe is labeled auditory cortex. Function: processes auditory information; and a small region in the top right of the auditory cortex is labeled primary auditory cortex. Two arrows from parietal cortex point to extrastriate cortex and auditory cortex. Attentional systems select information to process at serial bottlenecks where it is no longer possible to do things in parallel. Auditory Attention Some of the early research on attention was concerned with auditory attention, and much of this research centered on the dichotic listening task . In a typical dichotic listening experiment, illustrated in Figure 3.3 , participants wear a set of headphones. They hear two messages at the same time, one in each ear, and are asked to “shadow” one of the two messages (i.e., repeat back the words from that message only). Most participants are able to attend to one message and tune out the other.

So even though their choice behavior responded immediately to what they had been told, their FRN showed a slow learning process. It is as if their minds knew but their hearts had to learn. It is generally thought that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is responsible for a more reflective processing of rewards, while the dopamine neurons in the basal ganglia are responsible for a more reflexive processing of rewards. A number of neural imaging studies seem consistent with this interpretation. In one fMRI study, Knutson, Taylor, Kaufman, Peterson, and Glover (2005) presented participants with various uncertain outcomes, including in the magnitude and probability of rewards. For instance, on one trial participants might be told that they had a 50% chance of winning $5; on another trial that they had a 50% chance of winning $1 (i.e., the magnitude of the reward differed between trials). Similarly, participants might be told on one trial that they had an 80% chance of winning $5, and on another trial might be told that they had a 20% chance of winning $5 (i.e., the probability of the reward differed between trials). Knutson et al. imaged the brain activity associated with each such gamble. As shown in Figure 11.10a , the magnitude of the fMRI response in the nucleus accumbens in the basal ganglia reflected the different magnitudes of rewards (but did not reflect differences in the probabilities of rewards). In contrast, as shown in Figure 11.10b , the fMRI response in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex did reflect differences in the probabilities of rewards (but did not reflect differences in the magnitudes of rewards). Figure 11.10 Brain Activity in Response to Magnitude and Probability of Rewards.

It is also established that environment can change neurons; for example, dendritic branching and spine density are enhanced when animals are housed in an enriched environment. To see whether fatherhood alters brain structure, Gould’s group compared the prefrontal cortex of marmoset fathers with that of non-fathers who were part of a mating pair. Two interesting differences were found: The density of dedritic spines on pyramidal cells was signifi cantly higher in the fathers, and there appeared to be more vasopressin receptors on the spines. The functional consequences of these changes are not known, but they suggest that brains in other species that invest much time in childrearing, whether by the male or female, might be structurally changed by the experience. Estrogen Effects on Neuron Function, Memory, and Disease. Estrogens have powerful activational effects on the structure and function of neurons. Within minutes of experimental application, estradiol alters the intrinsic excitability of neurons in a broad range of brain areas. By modulating the fl ow of potassium ions, estradiol depolarizes some neurons and causes them to fi re more action potentials. A dramatic example of the effects estrogen can have on cell structure is shown in Figure 17.19. Dominique Toran-Allerand at Columbia University found that estradiol treatment of tissue taken from the hypothalamus of newborn mice causes a great degree of neurite ougrowth. Other studies have shown that estradiol increases cell viability and spine density. Taken together, these fi ndings suggest that estrogens play an important role in forming neuronal circuitry during brain development', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Neuroscience Exploring the Brain (fourth edition)', 'author': 'Mark F.

There is evidence that prefrontal regions are particularly important in the direction of central cognition, often known as executive control . The prefrontal cortex is that portion of the frontal cortex anterior to the premotor region (the premotor region is area 6 in Figure 1.7 ). Just as damage to parietal regions results in deficits in the deployment of perceptual attention, damage to prefrontal regions results in deficits of executive control. Patients with such damage often seem totally driven by the stimulus and fail to control their behavior according to their intentions. A patient who sees a comb on the table may be unable to inhibit the action of picking it up and beginning to comb her hair; another who sees a pair of glasses cannot help putting them on, even if he already has a pair on his face. Patients with damage to prefrontal regions show marked deficits in the Stroop task and often cannot refrain from saying the word rather than naming the color ( Janer & Pardo, 1991 ). Two prefrontal regions shown in Figure 3.2 seem particularly important in executive control. One is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) , which is the upper portion of the prefrontal cortex. It is called dorsolateral because it is high (dorsal) and to the side (lateral). The second region is the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) , which is folded under the visible surface of the brain along the midline. The DLPFC seems particularly important in the setting of intentions and the control of behavior. For instance, it is highly active during the simultaneous performance of dual tasks such as those whose results are reported in Figures 3.23 and 3.24 ( Szameitat, Schubert, Muller, & von Cramon, 2002 ). The ACC seems particularly active when people must monitor conflict between competing tendencies. For instance, brain-imaging studies show that it is highly active in Stroop trials when a participant must name the color of a color word printed in an ink of conflicting color ( Pardo, Pardo, Janer, & Raichle, 1990 )', 'distance': 0.29847967624664307, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 4.6340837}, {'id': 'cognitive_neuroscience_bear_2016_neuroscience_exploring_the_brain_page-823-864.json_chunk_17', 'metadata': {'author': '', 'chunk_id': 'cognitive_neuroscience_bear_2016_neuroscience_exploring_the_brain_page-823-864.json_chunk_17', 'course': 'cognitive_neuroscience', 'date_published': '2015-01-14', 'document_type': 'book', 'keywords': '', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\cognitive_neuroscience\\pdf_material\\Bear_2016_Neuroscience_Exploring_the_Brain.pdf', 'title': 'Bear_2016_Neuroscience_Exploring_the_Brain'}, 'text': '. Then, after Central sulcus Prefrontal cortex ▲ FIGURE 24.6 Prefrontal cortex. The brain rostral to the central sulcus is the frontal lobe. The prefrontal cortex is the anterior portion of the frontal lobe that receives afferents from the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus. 832 PART FOUR THE CHANGING BRAIN ten correct card placements have been made, the sorting category is changed, and the subject starts over again. To perform well on this test, a person must use memory of previous cards and errors in order to plan the next card placement. People with prefrontal lesions have great diffi - culty on this task when the sorting category is changed; they continue to sort according to a rule that no longer applies. It appears that they have a working memory defi cit that limits their ability to make use of recent information to change their behavior. The same kind of defi cit is seen in other tasks. For example, a person with a prefrontal lesion might be asked to trace a path through a maze drawn on a piece of paper. Although the patient understands the task, he or she will repeatedly make the same mistakes, returning to blind alleys. In other words, these patients do not learn from their recent experience in the same way as a normal person, suggesting a working memory defi cit. The neurons in prefrontal cortex have a variety of response types, some of which may refl ect a role in working memory. Figure 24.8 shows two response patterns obtained while a monkey performed a delayeresponse task. The neuron in the top trace responded while the animal fi rst saw the food wells, was unresponsive during the delay interval, and responded again when the animal saw the food wells again (Figure 24.8a). The response of the neuron simply correlates with visual stimulation. More interesting is the response pattern of the other neuron, which fi red only during the delay interval (Figure 24.8b). This cell was not directly actvated by the stimuli in the fi rst or second interval in which the monkey saw the food wells', 'distance': 0.2623138427734375, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 4.3512764}, {'id': 'intro_to_cognitive_science_cognitive_psychology_and_its_implications_page-1-851.json_chunk_33', 'metadata': {'author': 'John R.

Anderson).pdf', 'title': 'Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications'}, 'text': '. The front portion, called the prefrontal cortex , is thought to control higher-level processes, such as planning. The frontal portion of the brain is disproportionately larger in primates than in most other mammals, and among primates, humans are distinguished by having disproportionately larger anterior portions of the prefrontal cortex (area 10 in Figure 1.7 ) ( Semendeferi, Armstrong, Schleicher, Zilles, & Van Hoesen, 2001 ). Figure 1.7 Some of the 52 Distinct Regions of the Cerebral Cortex Identified by Brodmann, Based on Cell Structure and Arrangement. Most of the numbered regions missing from this figure (areas 12–16, 23–36, and 48–51) are wrapped inside the brain and so are not visible in this exterior view. Description The Brodman regions are labeled from 1 to 52 except the areas 12 to 16, 23 to 36, and 48 to 51. The regions are colored and numbered. The regions 1, 5, 21, 42, 43, and 44 are colored in dark green. The regions 2, 4, 19, 11 are colored in red. The regions 3, 6, 11, 37, and 46 are colored in yellow.

The neocortex is not the only region that plays a significant role in higher-level cognition. Many important circuits go from the cortex to subcortical structures and back again. A particularly significant group of subcortical structures is the limbic system, which is at the border between the cortex and lower structures. Among the structures making up the limbic system are the amygdala and the hippocampus (both of which are located inside the temporal lobe in each hemisphere). As we will see in later discussions, the amygdala is involved in emotional responses. The hippocampus appears to be critical to human memory; damage to the hippocampus and to other nearby structures produces severe amnesia, as we will see in Chapter 7', 'distance': 0.29290735721588135, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 3.5906758}, {'id': 'perception_and_action_hommel_2016_human_action_control___from_intentions_to_movements_page-11-42.json_chunk_42', 'metadata': {'author': 'Unknown', 'chunk_id': 'perception_and_action_hommel_2016_human_action_control___from_intentions_to_movements_page-11-42.json_chunk_42', 'course': 'perception_and_action', 'date_published': '2016-03-30', 'document_type': 'book', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\perception_and_action\\pdf_material\\Hommel_2016_Human action control _ from intentions to movements.pdf', 'title': 'Hommel_2016_Human action control _ from intentions to movements'}, 'text': '. Such a system can play a decisive role in the evaluation and selection of actions, and bias the action alternative that offers the greatest reward. 2.6 Prefrontal Cortex The frontal and in particular the prefrontal cortex are relatively voluminous in humans as compared to other species. For example, in dogs, the frontal cortex makes up about 7 % of the cortex, in monkeys about 17 %, and in humans, more than 30 %. Until fairly recently, this part of the brain was considered to be quite mysterious. By now, however, it has become clear that the neuronal populations of the frontal cortex are not just involved with the primary processing of light and sound stimuli, olfaction, taste, and tactile sensations, but mainly with so-called executive functions . When a human develops plans, makes judgments, forms intentions and transforms them into actions, then the frontal cortex is active. Besides this, the frontal cortex is crucial for working memory . This is a type of short-term storage that is required, for example, when people converse; to understand a spoken sentence, one must recall at the end what was said at the beginning. Such short-term memory is also required at a party, where one should remember who is already greeted, and who is yet to be greeted. More importantly, the frontal cortex checks the processes that occur on the way from intention to action, and recognizes posible errors . Even before you put sugar (instead of grated Parmesan cheese) on your spaghetti, your frontal cortex starts corrective measures and steers your hand away from the sugar and towards the Parmesan cheese. That the frontal region of the human brain is involved with intentions, and their conversion into actions, is corroborated by people with damage to this region. They often act thoughtlessly and prematurely, often change plans, ignore important infomation, and often commit errors without noticing it. Unless motor areas are affected, these patients are not noticeably or visibly disabled', 'distance': 0.28512832522392273, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 3.2321656}, {'id': 'intro_to_cognitive_science_cognitive_psychology_and_its_implications_page-1-851.json_chunk_391', 'metadata': {'author': 'John R.

Anderson).pdf', 'title': 'Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications'}, 'text': '. It is generally thought that in addition to these specific functions, the prefrontal cortex also plays a major role in the overall organization of behavior. The regions of the prefrontal cortex that we have discussed so far tend to be ventral (toward the bottom) and posterior (toward the back), and many of these regions are left lateralized. In contrast, dorsal (toward the top), anterior (toward the front), and bilateral prefrontal structures tend to be more involved in the organization of behavior. Goel and Grafman (2000) describe a patient, P.F., who suffered damage to his right anterior prefrontal cortex as the result of a stroke. Like many patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex, P.F. appears normal and even intelligent, scoring in the superior range on an intelligence test. Nonetheless, despite these surface appearances of normality, P.F. shows profound intellectual deficits. He had been a successful architect before his stroke but was forced to retire because he had lost his ability to design; he was then only able to find work as a draftsman. As part of their study, Goel and Grafman gave P.F. a problem that involved redesigning their laboratory space. Although he was able to speak coherently about the problem, he was unable to make any real progress on the solution (a comparably trained architect without brain damage achieved a good solution in a couple of hours). It seems that the stroke affected only P.F.’s most highly developed intellectual abilities. This chapter and Chapter 9 will look at what we know about the nature and the neural basis of human problem solving', 'distance': 0.30964723229408264, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 2.7845294}, {'id': 'intro_to_cognitive_science_cognitive_psychology_and_its_implications_page-1-851.json_chunk_275', 'text': '. Figure 6.1 Brain Structures Involved in the Creation, Storage, and Retrieval of Memories. Prefrontal regions are responsible for the creation and retrieval of memories. The hippocampus and surrounding structures in the temporal cortex are responsible for the permanent storage of memories. Description The cerebral cortex covering the front part of the frontal lobe is labeled prefrontal cortex, small curvy region in the right and left hemispheres near the center of the brain is labeled hippocampus, and a region beneath the lateral fissure of the cerebral hemispheres is labeled temporal cortex. These prefrontal regions exhibit laterality effects similar to those noted at the beginning of Chapter 5 ( Gabrieli, 2001 ). Specifically, study of verbal material tends to engage the left hemisphere more than the right hemisphere, whereas study of pictorial material tends to engage the right hemisphere more. Human memory depends heavily on prefrontal structures of the brain for the creation and retrieval of memories and on temporal structures for the permanent storage of these memories. Sensory Memory Before reaching the structures in Figure 6.1 , information must be processed by perceptual systems, and these systems display a brief memory. There has been extensive research into the nature of these brief sensory memories. Visual Sensory Memory Many studies of visual sensory memory have used a procedure in which participants are presented with a visual array of items, such as the letters shown in Figure 6.2 , for a brief period of time (e.g., 50 ms). When asked to recall the items, participants are typically able to correctly report three, four, five, or at most six items. One might think that only this much material can be held in visual memory — yet participants report that they were aware of more items but the items faded before they could attend to them and report them.

Goldman-Rakic (1992) examined monkey performance on other tasks that require maintaining other types of information over a delay interval. In one task, monkeys had to remember different objects. For example, the animal would have to remember to select a red circle and not a green square. It appears that a different area of the prefrontal cortex is involved in this type of task. Different neurons in this area will fire depending on whether a red circle or a green square is being remembered. Goldman-Rakic speculated that the prefrontal cortex is parceled into many small regions, each of which is responsible for remembering a different kind of information.

Description The regions and their functions are as follows: A region in the prefrontal cortex is labeled dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Function: directs central cognition; a region in the frontal lobe located in the posterior precentral gyrus immediately anterior to the central sulcus is labeled motor cortex. Function: control hands. A region between dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and motor cortex located in the front of the corpus callosum, in the medial frontal lobe is labeled anterior cingulate (midline structure). Function: monitors conflict. Two arrows from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulated points to motor cortex; a region behind the frontal lobe, in front of the occipital lobe, and above the temporal lobe is labeled parietal cortex. Function: attends to locations and objects; a region in the primary visual cortex is labeled extrastriate cortex. Function: processes visual information; a region located on the superior temporal gyrus in the temporal lobe is labeled auditory cortex. Function: processes auditory information; and a small region in the top right of the auditory cortex is labeled primary auditory cortex. Two arrows from parietal cortex point to extrastriate cortex and auditory cortex. Attentional systems select information to process at serial bottlenecks where it is no longer possible to do things in parallel. Auditory Attention Some of the early research on attention was concerned with auditory attention, and much of this research centered on the dichotic listening task . In a typical dichotic listening experiment, illustrated in Figure 3.3 , participants wear a set of headphones. They hear two messages at the same time, one in each ear, and are asked to “shadow” one of the two messages (i.e., repeat back the words from that message only). Most participants are able to attend to one message and tune out the other.

So even though their choice behavior responded immediately to what they had been told, their FRN showed a slow learning process. It is as if their minds knew but their hearts had to learn. It is generally thought that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is responsible for a more reflective processing of rewards, while the dopamine neurons in the basal ganglia are responsible for a more reflexive processing of rewards. A number of neural imaging studies seem consistent with this interpretation. In one fMRI study, Knutson, Taylor, Kaufman, Peterson, and Glover (2005) presented participants with various uncertain outcomes, including in the magnitude and probability of rewards. For instance, on one trial participants might be told that they had a 50% chance of winning $5; on another trial that they had a 50% chance of winning $1 (i.e., the magnitude of the reward differed between trials). Similarly, participants might be told on one trial that they had an 80% chance of winning $5, and on another trial might be told that they had a 20% chance of winning $5 (i.e., the probability of the reward differed between trials). Knutson et al. imaged the brain activity associated with each such gamble. As shown in Figure 11.10a , the magnitude of the fMRI response in the nucleus accumbens in the basal ganglia reflected the different magnitudes of rewards (but did not reflect differences in the probabilities of rewards). In contrast, as shown in Figure 11.10b , the fMRI response in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex did reflect differences in the probabilities of rewards (but did not reflect differences in the magnitudes of rewards). Figure 11.10 Brain Activity in Response to Magnitude and Probability of Rewards. (a) The nucleus accumbens shows greater activity in response to a 50% chance of a $5 reward than to a 50% chance of a $1 reward.

Regions of somatosensory cortex suserving other regions of the body were not affected by the lactating state. (Source: Adapted from Xerri et al., 1994.) 608 PART THREE THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR is known that across species, the prefrontal cortex is involved in complex, goal-directed behaviors. It is also established that environment can change neurons; for example, dendritic branching and spine density are enhanced when animals are housed in an enriched environment. To see whether fatherhood alters brain structure, Gould’s group compared the prefrontal cortex of marmoset fathers with that of non-fathers who were part of a mating pair. Two interesting differences were found: The density of dedritic spines on pyramidal cells was signifi cantly higher in the fathers, and there appeared to be more vasopressin receptors on the spines. The functional consequences of these changes are not known, but they suggest that brains in other species that invest much time in childrearing, whether by the male or female, might be structurally changed by the experience. Estrogen Effects on Neuron Function, Memory, and Disease. Estrogens have powerful activational effects on the structure and function of neurons. Within minutes of experimental application, estradiol alters the intrinsic excitability of neurons in a broad range of brain areas. By modulating the fl ow of potassium ions, estradiol depolarizes some neurons and causes them to fi re more action potentials. A dramatic example of the effects estrogen can have on cell structure is shown in Figure 17.19. Dominique Toran-Allerand at Columbia University found that estradiol treatment of tissue taken from the hypothalamus of newborn mice causes a great degree of neurite ougrowth. Other studies have shown that estradiol increases cell viability and spine density. Taken together, these fi ndings suggest that estrogens play an important role in forming neuronal circuitry during brain development', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Neuroscience Exploring the Brain (fourth edition)', 'author': 'Mark F.

There are a number of sequence-learning models, but in the basic procedure, a participant observes a sequence of lights flash and must press corresponding buttons. For instance, there may be four lights with a button under each, and the task is to press the buttons 1 in the same order as the lights flash. The typical manipulation is to introduce a repeating sequence of lights and contrast how much faster participants can press the keys in this sequence than when the sequence is random. For instance, in the original Nissen and Bullemer (1987) study, the repeating sequence might be 4-2-3-1-3-2- 4-3-2-1. After a sufficient number of repeats, people are faster with such a repeating sequence than when the lights come up in a random order. There has been much interest in the question of whether participants are aware that there is a repeating sequence. In some experiments, they are aware of the repetition; but in many others, they are not. They tend not to notice the repeating sequence when the experimental pace is fast or when they are performing some secondary task. However, participants are faster at the repeated sequence whether they are aware of it or not. It does not appear that the hippocampus is critical to developing proficiency with the repeated sequence, because amnesics show an advantage for the repeated sequence, as do normal patients with pharmacologically induced amnesia. Rather, a set of subcortical structures, referred to as the basal ganglia (see Figure 1.8 ), does appear to be critical for sequence learning. It has long been known that the basal ganglia are critical to motor control, because damage to these structures produces the deficits associated with Huntington’s and Parkinson’s diseases, which are characterized by uncontrolled movements. However, there are rich connections between the basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex, and it is now known that the basal ganglia are also important in cognitive functions', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications', 'author': 'John R.

From the perspective of the processes that take a hand to a location in space, this is a context in which errorful and biased reaching seems likely. Memories for Previous Reaches Finally, the evidence suggests that repeated reaches over and over to the same location—what infants do in the A-not-B task and what monkeys did for the Georgopoulos group—alter the internal activity that signals a reach and the directional bias of a movement. In particular, the evidence from monkeys suggests that repeated reaches lead to more finely timed and more finely tuned population vectors (Georgopoulos, Crutcher, & Schwartz, 1989). Other stuies suggest that such repeated activity also leads to an increased tendency for the system to repeat the immediately preceding activity (Racazone, Merzenich, & Schreiner, 1992; Roby-Brami & Burnod, 1995). Indeed, rapidly repeated movements by adults have been shown to be biased in the direction of past activity (Hening, Vaccaria, & Ghez, 1988; Jeannerod, 1988; Lackner & DiZio, 1994; Shadmehr & Mussa-Ivaldi, 1994). Memories for the last reaches seem most likely to interfere when the new reaching target is not perceptually salient or is similar to the previous reaching target. This is the A-not-B task. Reaching Account of the A-Not-B Error In view of the extant evidence on reaching to visual targets, we propose that a reach emerges from a continually evolving and self-organizing system, a flow of information better illustrated by Figure 3 than by Figure 1. In this new depiction, the visual input, most critically, where one is looking, defines and continuously influences the reach goal and the movement. However, the goal and the movement also influence where one looks. The momentary activity of the system is the joint product of all these and also of their recent history. In this way, the goal of an action and the action itself are inseparable. We propose that the A-not-B error emerges as a direct consequence of this system and its unskilled form in infancy', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'research_paper', 'title': 'smiththelen1999', 'author': 'Unknown', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\philosophy_of_cognitive_science\\pdf_material\\smiththelen1999.pdf', 'date_published': '2004-09-10', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science_smiththelen1999.json_chunk_19', 'course': 'philosophy_of_cognitive_science'}, 'bm25_score': 2.3224897384643555, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': np.float32(1.3927819)}]"

That is, they do not point declaratively to simply share interest and attention in something with another individual (Gomez 2004), and they do not point informatively to inform another of something she might want or need to know— as human infants do from very early in ontogeny (see chapter 4). Tomasello and Carpenter (2005) even prsented three young human-raised chimpanzees with siuations that reliably elicit expressive-declarative pointing in human infants (e.g., surprising, interesting events), but observed no declaratives from them in response. And even the signed productions of “linguistic” apes are almost all imperatives—approximately 96–98 percent in the only two systematic studies (Rivas 2005; Greenfi eld and Savage-Rumbaugh, 1990), with the other 2–4 percent having no clear functional interpretation (they are not clearly declarative or informative, but more recognitory or classifi catory, as the ape simply recognizes something and produces the associated sign in recognition). This functional restriction probably accounts in large part for apes’ surprising troubles in comprehending human pointing gestures designed to inform them of things helpfully, as we shall now see. 2.3.2 Comprehending Pointing Great apes follow the gaze direction of others, even to hidden locations behind barriers (Tomasello, Hare, and Primate Intentional Communication 39 Agnetta 1999; Bräuer, Call, and Tomasello 2005). If a human points and looks toward some food that an ape currently does not see, and by following the pointing/ looking the ape comes to see the food, she will go get it. In this sense, one could say that the ape understood the intention behind the human’s attention-directing gesture in this simple situation. But a seemingly minor change in this procedure leads to a drastically different result—which might lead us to reassess the simpler situation', 'distance': 0.32715126872062683, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': np.float32(2.9865766)}, {'id': 'cognition_and_communication_origins_of_human_communication_page-13-55.json_chunk_14', 'text': '. And it is precisely this indirectness that is the true novelty here. The communicator has some action he wants from the recipient—what we may call his social intention— and to attain this he attempts to draw the recipient’s attention to something—what we may call his “ referential” intention 1 —in the expectation that if she looks where he wishes, she will do as he wishes. This twtiered intentional structure is a genuine evolutionary novelty—almost certainly confi ned to great apes and perhaps other primates—and may be considered the closest thing we have to a “missing link” between nonhman primate communication and the sophisticated attetion-directing and attention-sharing characteristic of human referential communication. 1. “Referential” is in scare quotes because, I would argue, what apes are doing is a precursor to human reference while differing in some respects—which can only be fully characterized after human reference is described in the next chapter. 30 Chapter 2 Finally, it is important that apes regularly string together sequences of gestures, involving both intentiomovements and attention-getters. Systematic investigtion of these, however, has revealed no “grammar” in the sense of specifi c combinations creating new communictive functions or “meanings” (Liebal, Call, and Tomasello 2004). What seems to happen—and this provides further support for the intentional nature of great ape gestural communication—is that the communicator tries one gesture, monitors the response of the recipient, and, if needed, repeats or tries a different gesture. This shows persistence to a goal with adjusted means as necessary— the prototype of intentional action—but it does not show any kind of combinatorial or grammatical capacity (see chapter 6). 2.2.2 Attention to the Attention of the Other A crucially important difference between communication in the vocal and gestural modalities is how the particpants monitor one another’s attention in the process.

what is the basal ganglia and the brainstem?,"A fascinating question!

The Basal Ganglia (BG) and Brainstem are two important structures in the human brain.

**Basal Ganglia (BG):**
The Basal Ganglia is a group of subcortical structures located deep within the telencephalon, which is the largest part of the forebrain. The BG consists of four main components:

1. **Striatum**: responsible for processing motor information and planning movements.
2. **Globus Pallidus**: involved in filtering and regulating motor output.
3. **Subthalamic Nucleus**: plays a role in modulating motor activity and preventing excessive movement.
4. **Substantia Nigra**: produces dopamine, a neurotransmitter essential for motor control and cognition.

The Basal Ganglia is involved in various functions, including:

* Motor planning and execution
* Cognition and learning
* Emotional processing and regulation

Disorders affecting the BG include Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and dystonia.

**Brainstem:**
The Brainstem connects the cerebrum to the spinal cord and is responsible for controlling many of our automatic functions. It consists of three main parts:

1. **Midbrain**: involved in hearing, vision, and body temperature regulation.
2. **Pons**: plays a role in sleep, arousal, and swallowing.
3. **Medulla Oblongata**: responsible for controlling the basic functions we need to survive, such as breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion.

The Brainstem is also involved in:

* Regulating autonomic nervous system function (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure)
* Modulating sensory input from the senses
* Controlling reflexes (automatic responses)

Disorders affecting the Brainstem include brainstem encephalitis, bulbar palsy, and some types of stroke.

In summary, the Basal Ganglia is a group of subcortical structures involved in motor planning, cognition, and emotional regulation, while the Brainstem is responsible for controlling many automatic functions essential for survival.","[""Based on the provided context, the Basal Ganglia (BG) is a group of structures in the brain that play a crucial role in various cognitive and motor processes. The BG receives signals from almost all areas of the cortex and sends signals to the frontal cortex.\n\nThe BG is involved in both basic motor control and complex cognition.

One of the functions of this loop appears to be the selection and initiation of willed movements. Anatomy of the Basal Ganglia The basal ganglia consist of the caudate nucleus , the putamen , the globus pallidus (consisting of an internal segment, GPi, and an extenal segment, GPe), and the subthalamic nucleus . In addition, we can add the substantia nigra , a midbrain structure that is reciprocally conected with the basal ganglia of the forebrain (Figure 14.12). The caudate and putamen together are called the striatum , which is the target of the cortical input to the basal ganglia. The globus pallidus is the source of the output to the thalamus. The other structures participate in various side loops that modulate the direct path: Cortex → Striatum → GPi → VLo → Cortex (SMA) Through the microscope, the neurons of the striatum appear randomly scattered, with no apparent order such as that seen in the layers of the cortex. But this bland appearance hides a degree of complexity in the organization of the basal ganglia that we only partially understand. It appears that the basal ganglia participate in a large number of parallel circuits, only a few of which are strictly motor. Other circuits are involved in certain aspects of memory and cognitive function. We will try to give a concise account of the motor function of the basal ganglia, simplifying this very complex and poorly understood part of the brain.

The major structures of the basal ganglia (blue-shaded areas) include the caudate nucleus, the subthalamic nucleus, the substantia nigra, the globus pallidus, and the putamen. The critical connections (inputs and outputs) of the basal ganglia are illustrated with arrows.

The brain is organized into a number of distinct areas, which serve different types of functions, with the neocortex playing the major role in higher cognitive functions. Localization of Function The left and right hemispheres of the cerebral cortex appear to be somewhat specialized for different types of processing. In general, the left hemisphere seems to be associated with linguistic and analytic processing, whereas the right hemisphere is associated with perceptual and spatial processing. The left and right hemispheres are connected by a broad band of fibers called the corpus callosum', 'distance': 0.25684213638305664, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': np.float32(1.9541612)}, {'id': 'intro_to_cognitive_science_cognitive_psychology_and_its_implications_page-1-851.json_chunk_387', 'metadata': {'chunk_id': 'intro_to_cognitive_science_cognitive_psychology_and_its_implications_page-1-851.json_chunk_387', 'keywords': 'Psychology', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\intro_to_cognitive_science\\pdf_material\\Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications (John R.

However, there are rich connections between the basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex, and it is now known that the basal ganglia are also important in cognitive functions. They have been shown to be active during the learning of a number of skills, including sequence learning ( Middleton & Strick, 1994 ). Nonhuman primates are capable of mastering sequence tasks and have been used to study the neural basis of sequence learning. Such primate studies have shown that the basal ganglia are critical to early learning of a sequence. For instance, Miyachi, Hikosaka, Miyashita, Karadi, and Rand (1997) were able to impair early sequential learning in monkeys by injecting their basal ganglia with a chemical that temporally inactivated it. Other neural structures appear to be involved in sequence learning as well. For instance, similar chemical inactivation of structures in the cerebellum impairs later learning of a sequence. All in all, the evidence is pretty compelling that procedural learning involves structures different from those involved in explicit learning. Procedural learning is another type of implicit learning and is supported by the basal ganglia. Conclusions: The Many Varieties of Memory in the Brain Figure 7.17 shows the different types and subtypes of memory proposed by Squire (1987) . The major distinction in his classification is between explicit memory and implicit memory, which he calls declarative memory and nondeclarative memory . It appears that the hippocampus is particularly important for the establishment of declarative memories. Within the declarative memory system, there is a distinction between episodic and semantic memory. Episodic memories include information about where and when they were acquired. For example, a memory of a particular newscast can be considered an episodic memory. This chapter and Chapter 6 have discussed these kinds of memories. Semantic memories, discussed in Chapter 5 , reflect general knowledge of the world, such as what a dog is or what a restaurant is', 'distance': 0.32578665018081665, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': np.float32(0.7557629)}, {'id': 'intro_to_cognitive_science_cognitive_psychology_and_its_implications_page-1-851.json_chunk_34', 'metadata': {'title': 'Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications', 'keywords': 'Psychology', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\intro_to_cognitive_science\\pdf_material\\Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications (John R.

The hippocampus appears to be critical to human memory; damage to the hippocampus and to other nearby structures produces severe amnesia, as we will see in Chapter 7 .

Figure 1.8 The Human Brain: Some Subcortical Structures. Structures under the cortex include tho make up the limbic system (the hippocampus, amygdala, and other structures), the thalamus, and the basal ganglia. Description The cerebral cortex constitutes the uppermost part of the brain. A backwards C-shaped structure at the center, encompassing an ovoid structure is labeled basal ganglia. The thalamus is located in the midbrain, posterior to the ovoid structure. A small curvy region in the medial temporal lobe below the basal ganglia is labeled hippocampus, attached to the inferior of the basal ganglia. An almond-shaped structure at the inferior tip of the basal ganglia is labeled amygdala. Another important collection of subcortical structures is the basal ganglia . The major structures and critical connections of the basal ganglia are illustrated in Figure 1.9 . The basal ganglia are involved both in basic motor control and in the control of complex cognition. These structures receive signals from almost all areas of the cortex and send signals to the frontal cortex. Disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease result from damage to the basal ganglia. Although people suffering from these diseases have dramatic motor control deficits characterized by tremors and rigidity, they also have difficulties in cognitive tasks. The cerebellum — in addition to its major role in motor control, as noted above — also seems to play a role in higher-order cognition. Many cognitive deficits have been observed in patients with damage to the cerebellum.

A particularly important function of the basal ganglia is the prduction of dopamine, a very infl uential neurotransmitter that modulates numerous cognitive and motor processes. 2.5 Basal Ganglia 38 2.5.1 Consequences of Damage to the Basal Ganglia Damage to the basal ganglia leads to a number of disruptions in voluntary motor skills , which are manifested in different manners, depending on which structures are damaged: a strong retardation of movements (bradykinesia), which is refl ected by increased reaction times to visual and acoustic stimuli and altered speed profi les in goal-directed movements; a rest tremor (involuntary, rhythmic oscillations of the limbs); and a heightened stiffness of the musculature (rigor) can be the result of damage to the substantia nigra. Disruptions of this kind often occur in Parkinson’s disease (morbus Parkinson), one of the most common neurological ailments (famous Parkinson’s patients are the late pope John Paul II and the ex-boxing chapion Muhammad Ali). The neurophysiological cause of the disease is the massive loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra. Damage in the area of the striatum is causes of Huntington’s disease , which is manifested by massive gait and postural instabilities. Finally, lesions of the nucleus subthalamicus lead to involuntary heavy, large-amplitude movements. Both Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases are explained by damage to the basal ganglia (and the accompanying dopaminergic failure regulation), which leads to a disturbed balance between excitatory and inhibitory infl uences on the frontal cortex (Alexander et al. 1990 ). According this conception, the execution of volutary action is blocked by Parkinson’s patients, while the inhibitory infl uences are increased drastically, which suppresses the initiation of voluntary movements, or at least makes their initiation harder', 'distance': 0.28241243958473206, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': np.float32(0.37833986)}]"

According to one model, increased inhibition of the thalamus by the basal ganglia undelies hypokinesia , a paucity of movement, whereas decreased basal ganglia output leads to hyperkinesia , an excess of movement. Parkinson’s disease exemplifi es the fi rst condition. This disorder, which affects about 1% of all people over age 60, is characterized by hypoknesia. Its symptoms include slowness of movement ( bradykinesia ), diffi culty in initiating willed movements ( akinesia ), increased muscle tone ( rigidity ), and tremors of the hands and jaw, which are most prominent at rest when the patient is not attempting to move. Many patients also suffer defi cits of cognition as the disease progresses. The organic basis of Parkinson’s disease is a degeneration of certain substantia nigra neurons and their inputs to the striatum (Box 14.3). These inputs use the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA). The actions of DA are complex because it binds to multiple types of striatal DA receptors that mediate quite different effects (see Figure 14.14).

tell me about apes and tomasselo please,"Hi there! I'm a cognitive science tutor, and I'm happy to help you with any questions or topics related to cognitive science. 

Regarding the context you provided about ape cognition and Tomasello, it seems like Michael Tomasello and his team have done extensive research on primate intentional communication. 

From the text, it appears that Tomasello and his colleagues have found that great apes (such as chimpanzees) have a basic understanding of how individuals pursue goals and have internal representations of the world they want to bring about. They also seem to understand that others have perceptions, as demonstrated by their behavior when humans peer behind barriers, have directed gazes, or are able to see their gestures. 

Some key findings include:

- Apes move to get a better viewing angle when a human peers behind a barrier, indicating they understand the human's perspective.
- Apes look to the barrier, not the object, unless the barrier has a window, showing they understand the human's gaze.
- Apes take into account whether a human can see their gestures when begging for food.
- Chimpanzees conceal their approach from a competitor when competing for food, demonstrating an understanding of the competitor's perception.

Tomasello's research suggests that apes have a level of social cognition and intentionality similar to that of human infants. This is an interesting area of study that highlights the similarities and differences between human and non-human primate cognition.

The conclusion is thus that apes and young human chidren both understand in the same basic way (in simple situations) that individuals pursue a goal in a persistent manner until they have reached it—and they understand the goal not as the result produced in the external envronment, but rather as the actor’s internal representation Primate Intentional Communication 47 of the state of the world she wishes to bring about. They also understand that the actor chooses an action to pursue a goal “rationally” in the sense that they consider the actor’s reasons for doing what he is doing. Second, great apes (most of the research is again with chimpanzees) also understand that others have percetions. Evidence is as follows (see Tomasello and Call 2006 for a review): • When a human peers behind a barrier, apes move over to get a better viewing angle to look behind it as well (Tomasello, Hare, and Agnetta 1999; Bräuer et al. 2006; see Moll and Tomasello 2004 for a similar study with human infants). • When a human’s gaze is directed toward a barrier and there is also an object further in that same direction, apes look only to the barrier and not to the object—unless the barrier has a window in it, in which case they look to the object (Okamoto-Barth, Call, and Tomasello 2007; see Caron et al. 2002 for similar fi ndings with human infants). • When apes beg a human for food, they take into account whether the human can see their gesture (Kaminski, Call, and Tomasello 2004; Liebal, Pika, Call, and Tomasello 2004). • When chimpanzees compete with one another for food they take into account whether their competitor can see the contested food (Hare et al. 2000; Hare, Call, Tomasello 2001), and even on occasion attempt to conceal their 48 Chapter 2 approach from a competitor (Hare, Call, Tomasello 2006; Melis, Call, and Tomasello 2006)', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Origins of Human Communication', 'author': 'User', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\cognition_and_communication\\pdf_material\\origins_of_human_communication__michael_tomasello.pdf', 'date_published': '2008-08-14', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'cognition_and_communication_origins_of_human_communication_page-13-55.json_chunk_28', 'course': 'cognition_and_communication'}, 'bm25_score': 4.027990341186523, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': np.float32(0.60637474)}]"

What is the basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex? answer concisely,"The basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex are brain structures involved in different aspects of cognitive and motor functions. 

The basal ganglia consist of several sub-structures, including the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, and subthalamic nucleus, which play a crucial role in motor control, habit formation, and procedural learning. They are involved in the initiation and regulation of movements, and are also implicated in cognitive functions such as memory and decision-making.

The prefrontal cortex, on the other hand, is a region in the frontal lobe of the brain that is involved in higher-order cognitive processes, such as executive functions, decision-making, and planning. It is also responsible for reflective processing of rewards and is thought to play a role in conflict monitoring and error detection.

However, there are rich connections between the basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex, and it is now known that the basal ganglia are also important in cognitive functions. They have been shown to be active during the learning of a number of skills, including sequence learning ( Middleton & Strick, 1994 ). Nonhuman primates are capable of mastering sequence tasks and have been used to study the neural basis of sequence learning. Such primate studies have shown that the basal ganglia are critical to early learning of a sequence. For instance, Miyachi, Hikosaka, Miyashita, Karadi, and Rand (1997) were able to impair early sequential learning in monkeys by injecting their basal ganglia with a chemical that temporally inactivated it. Other neural structures appear to be involved in sequence learning as well. For instance, similar chemical inactivation of structures in the cerebellum impairs later learning of a sequence. All in all, the evidence is pretty compelling that procedural learning involves structures different from those involved in explicit learning. Procedural learning is another type of implicit learning and is supported by the basal ganglia. Conclusions: The Many Varieties of Memory in the Brain Figure 7.17 shows the different types and subtypes of memory proposed by Squire (1987) . The major distinction in his classification is between explicit memory and implicit memory, which he calls declarative memory and nondeclarative memory . It appears that the hippocampus is particularly important for the establishment of declarative memories. Within the declarative memory system, there is a distinction between episodic and semantic memory. Episodic memories include information about where and when they were acquired. For example, a memory of a particular newscast can be considered an episodic memory. This chapter and Chapter 6 have discussed these kinds of memories. Semantic memories, discussed in Chapter 5 , reflect general knowledge of the world, such as what a dog is or what a restaurant is', 'distance': 0.28623726963996887, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': np.float32(2.8488753)}, {'id': 'cognitive_neuroscience_bear_2016_neuroscience_exploring_the_brain_page-483-517.json_chunk_23', 'metadata': {'keywords': '', 'chunk_id': 'cognitive_neuroscience_bear_2016_neuroscience_exploring_the_brain_page-483-517.json_chunk_23', 'title': 'Bear_2016_Neuroscience_Exploring_the_Brain', 'author': '', 'course': 'cognitive_neuroscience', 'document_type': 'book', 'date_published': '2015-01-14', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\cognitive_neuroscience\\pdf_material\\Bear_2016_Neuroscience_Exploring_the_Brain.pdf'}, 'text': '. One of the functions of this loop appears to be the selection and initiation of willed movements. Anatomy of the Basal Ganglia The basal ganglia consist of the caudate nucleus , the putamen , the globus pallidus (consisting of an internal segment, GPi, and an extenal segment, GPe), and the subthalamic nucleus . In addition, we can add the substantia nigra , a midbrain structure that is reciprocally conected with the basal ganglia of the forebrain (Figure 14.12). The caudate and putamen together are called the striatum , which is the target of the cortical input to the basal ganglia. The globus pallidus is the source of the output to the thalamus. The other structures participate in various side loops that modulate the direct path: Cortex → Striatum → GPi → VLo → Cortex (SMA) Through the microscope, the neurons of the striatum appear randomly scattered, with no apparent order such as that seen in the layers of the cortex. But this bland appearance hides a degree of complexity in the organization of the basal ganglia that we only partially understand. It appears that the basal ganglia participate in a large number of parallel circuits, only a few of which are strictly motor. Other circuits are involved in certain aspects of memory and cognitive function. We will try to give a concise account of the motor function of the basal ganglia, simplifying this very complex and poorly understood part of the brain.

So even though their choice behavior responded immediately to what they had been told, their FRN showed a slow learning process. It is as if their minds knew but their hearts had to learn. It is generally thought that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is responsible for a more reflective processing of rewards, while the dopamine neurons in the basal ganglia are responsible for a more reflexive processing of rewards. A number of neural imaging studies seem consistent with this interpretation. In one fMRI study, Knutson, Taylor, Kaufman, Peterson, and Glover (2005) presented participants with various uncertain outcomes, including in the magnitude and probability of rewards. For instance, on one trial participants might be told that they had a 50% chance of winning $5; on another trial that they had a 50% chance of winning $1 (i.e., the magnitude of the reward differed between trials). Similarly, participants might be told on one trial that they had an 80% chance of winning $5, and on another trial might be told that they had a 20% chance of winning $5 (i.e., the probability of the reward differed between trials). Knutson et al. imaged the brain activity associated with each such gamble. As shown in Figure 11.10a , the magnitude of the fMRI response in the nucleus accumbens in the basal ganglia reflected the different magnitudes of rewards (but did not reflect differences in the probabilities of rewards). In contrast, as shown in Figure 11.10b , the fMRI response in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex did reflect differences in the probabilities of rewards (but did not reflect differences in the magnitudes of rewards). Figure 11.10 Brain Activity in Response to Magnitude and Probability of Rewards. (a) The nucleus accumbens shows greater activity in response to a 50% chance of a $5 reward than to a 50% chance of a $1 reward.

Direct and Indirect Pathways through the Basal Ganglia The motor loop through the basal ganglia originates with excitatory connetions from the cortex.

The thalamocortical connection (from VLo to SMA) is excitatory and facilitates the discharge of movement-related cells in the SMA. This direct motor loop is summarized in Figure 14.13. In general, the direct pathway allows the basal ganglia to enhance the initiation of desired movements. Cortical activation of the putamen leads to excitation of the SMA by VL. Let’s work out how this happens. A criical point is that neurons in the internal segment of the globus pallidus are spontaneously active at rest, and therefore they tonically inhibit VL. Cortical activation (1) excites putamen neurons, which (2) inhibit GPi neurons, which (3) release the cells in VLo from inhibition, allowing them to become active. The activity in VLo boosts the activity of the SMA. Thus, this part of the circuit acts as a positive-feedback loop that may serve to focus, or funnel, the activation of widespread cortical areas onto the supplementary motor area of cortex', 'distance': 0.28734320402145386, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': np.float32(0.9608927)}, {'id': 'intro_to_cognitive_science_cognitive_psychology_and_its_implications_page-1-851.json_chunk_35', 'metadata': {'author': 'John R.

Many cognitive deficits have been observed in patients with damage to the cerebellum. Figure 1.9 Basal Ganglia. The major structures of the basal ganglia (blue-shaded areas) include the caudate nucleus, the subthalamic nucleus, the substantia nigra, the globus pallidus, and the putamen. The critical connections (inputs and outputs) of the basal ganglia are illustrated with arrows. Description A magnified view of the cerebral cortex is shown, parts of the outer layer corresponding to different labeled parts. A bean shaped structure is labeled caudate nucleus. A large almost round shaped structure is labeled putamen and a triangular shaped structure attached to the putamen is labeled globus pallidus, which contains the caudate nucleaus. A medium bean shaped structure is labeled substantia nigra, which contains the globus pallidus, and a small bean shaped structure above substantia nigra is labeled subthalamic nucleus. A rounded structure with three sections is labeled thalamus and includes the subthalamic nucleus within the outer two sections, and the globus pallidus in the central and larger outer portion.One part of cerebral cortex connects with caudate nucleus which connects with globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Another part of cerebral cortex connects with putamen. Another part also connects with putamen. The larger outer portion of the thalamous connects to motor cortex and frontal areas. The brain is organized into a number of distinct areas, which serve different types of functions, with the neocortex playing the major role in higher cognitive functions. Localization of Function The left and right hemispheres of the cerebral cortex appear to be somewhat specialized for different types of processing. In general, the left hemisphere seems to be associated with linguistic and analytic processing, whereas the right hemisphere is associated with perceptual and spatial processing. The left and right hemispheres are connected by a broad band of fibers called the corpus callosum', 'distance': 0.2702566981315613, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': np.float32(0.49373618)}]"
