I have made a hieratcihcal bayesian model with group level priors and player level parameter estimation. When evaluating the performance is it completely shit to use the best sample accuracy?,"What a fascinating problem! Given the context of Bayesian statistics and hierarchical modeling, I'd say that using sample accuracy as a performance metric might not be the most informative or insightful choice.

Typically, in such complex models, more nuanced metrics are used to evaluate performance. Here are a few options:

1. Cross-validation: Use techniques like leave-one-out cross-validation or k-fold cross-validation to estimate the model's generalization ability.
2. Log-loss or negative log-likelihood: Compute the average log-loss or negative log-likelihood across the test set to quantify the model's predictive performance.
3. Posterior predictive checks: Visualize the predictive distributions and compare them with observed data to assess the model's fit.

These metrics can provide more insights into your model's strengths and weaknesses, rather than relying solely on sample accuracy.

Mean log-likelihood (or cross-entropy) across all samples: This gives you an idea of how well your model is fitting the data.\n2.

"ok nice. Explain log-loss to me, i have a 10 category classification problem","Log-loss! Also known as cross-entropy loss, it's a popular performance metric in Bayesian modeling and deep learning.

In your 10-category classification problem, log-loss measures the model's ability to correctly predict the class labels. It calculates the negative log-likelihood of the true labels given the predicted probabilities.

Mathematically, log-loss (LL) is defined as:

LL = - ∑(y_true * log(y_pred) + (1-y_true) * log(1-y_pred))

where y_true is the one-hot encoded true label, and y_pred is the predicted probability distribution for each class.

To calculate log-loss, you'll need to:

1. Predict probabilities for each class using your Bayesian model.
2. Compute the negative log-likelihood using the formula above.

The lower the log-loss value, the better your model performs in terms of classification accuracy. In Python, you can use libraries like scikit-learn or Keras to compute log-loss.

what is a by-chance log loss of 10 categories?,"Given the context of log-loss in classification problems and your 10-category classification problem, I'd say that a by-chance log-loss value can serve as a baseline for evaluating your model's performance.

In a 10-category classification problem, a by-chance log-loss represents the expected log-loss value if you were to randomly guess the class labels. This is because, in the absence of any informative signal, your model would be reduced to simply guessing the categories at random.

A typical by-chance log-loss for a 10-category classification problem would depend on the prior distribution and the number of classes. However, as a rough estimate, you can use the following rule of thumb:

For a balanced dataset (i.e., roughly equal number of samples per class), the by-chance log-loss would be around 2-3.

To calculate this, you can consider the entropy of the uniform distribution over the 10 classes. This gives you an approximate value for the by-chance log-loss.

how eye work,"What a fascinating topic! Let's dive into how eyes work.

Eyes are incredibly complex organs that play a crucial role in our ability to perceive and interpret the world around us. Here's a simplified overview of how they function:

1. **Light enters the eye**: When light from an object enters your eye, it passes through the cornea (the transparent outer layer) and the pupil (the small opening).
2. **Lens focuses the light**: The light is then focused by the crystalline lens onto the retina. This is achieved by the lens changing shape to adjust for different distances.
3. **Photoreceptors convert light into electrical signals**: The light is absorbed by photoreceptors (rods and cones) in the retina, which convert it into electrical signals.
4. **Signals transmitted to the brain**: These electrical signals are transmitted to the optic nerve, a bundle of nerves that carries visual information from the eye to the brain.
5. **Brain interprets the signals**: The brain interprets these signals to create a visual representation of the world, including color, shape, movement, and depth.

In addition to this basic process, eyes also have other important functions:

* **Accommodation**: The lens adjusts focus for near or far vision.
* **Pupil control**: The pupil constricts or dilates to regulate the amount of light entering the eye.
* **Eye movements**: Eyes move to track targets and adjust focus.

In the context of cognitive science, understanding how eyes work is crucial in analyzing visual attention, perception, and cognition. Eye tracking technology can measure eye movements, providing valuable insights into human behavior, learning, and decision-making processes.

Although you could subsequently ask participants that question, their meory may not be completely accurate. With an eye tracking system, you can tell whether the participant at least fixated on the link long enough to read it. 7.1 HOW EYE TRACKING WORKS Although a few different technologies are used, many eye tracking systems, such as the one shown in Fig. 7.1 , use some combination of an infrared video camera and infrared light sources to track where the participant is looking. The infrared light sources create reflections on the surface of the participant's eye (called the coneal reflection), and the system compares the location of that reflection to the location of the participant's pupil. The location of the corneal reflection relative to the pupil changes as the partiipant moves his eyes. The first activity in any eye tracking study is to calibrate the system by asking the participants to look at a series of known points; then the system can subsequently interpolate where a participant is looking based on the location of the corneal reflection. Typically, the researcher can check the quality of the calibration, usually expressed as degrees that devate from the X and Y visual planes. Deviations less than one degree are geneally considered to be acceptable, and less than one-half of a degree is very good. Most eye tracking systems tell you something about the quality of the calibrtion and an opportunity to attempt another calibration to improve the accuracy. It is critical that the calibration is satisfactory; otherwise, all the eye movement data should not be recorded or analyzed.

As a UX researcher, eye tracking is a valuable method to better understand how someone visually interacts with any stimuli, answering fundamental questions such as: • What do they notice? • How long do they look at it? • What do they see first? • What don’t they notice (that they should)? Eye tracking has been around since the early 1900s. Huey (1908) devised a system whereby someone would wear a contact lens with a small hole for the pupil. The contact lens was then physically attached to a pointing device which would allow researchers to observe eye movements while reading text. Thankfully, we have come a long way since then. Eye tracking is now affordable (for most budgets), highly accurate, able to measure eye movements across a wide variety of stimuli and scenes, portable (through glasses), and the analysis and visualization tools are powerful and easy to use. Plus, there is no need to inject ink into anyone's eye! Eye tracking is typically performed in one of two ways in the context of user research. In one way, eye tracking is based on a set of research questions that necessitate the need to analyze eye movements"", 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Measuring the User Experience (third edition)', 'author': 'Bill ALbert, Tom Tullis', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Human_computer_interaction\\pdf_material\\Measuring the User Experience.pdf', 'date_published': '2022-09-11', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Human_computer_interaction_measuring_the_user_experience_page-177-193.json_chunk_1', 'course': 'Human_computer_interaction'}, 'bm25_score': 4.148815631866455, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 2.5954213}, {'id': 'Human_computer_interaction_eye_tracking_the_complete_pocket_guide.json_chunk_2', 'text': '.

Also, make sure not to miss ourwebinar covering all about the different types of eye tracking setups. – How exactly does eye tracking work? Eye tracking use is on the rise.While early devices were highly intrusive and involved particularly cumbersome procedures to set up, modern eye trackers have undergone quite a technological evolution in recent years. Long gone are the rigid experimental setups and seating arrangements you might think of. Modern eye trackers are hardly any larger than smart phones and provide an extremely natural experience for respondents. Remote, non-intrusive methods have made eye tracking both an easy-to-use andaccessible tool in human behavior researchthat allows objective measurements of eye movements in real-time. Most modern eye trackers utilize near-infrared technology along with a high-resolution camera (or other optical sensor) to track gaze direction. The underlying concept, commonly referred to asPupil Center Corneal Reflection (PCCR), is actually rather simple. It essentially involves the camera tracking the pupil center, and where light reflects from the cornea. An image of how this looks like is on the right. The math behind it is well, a bit more complex. We won‘t bore you with the nature of algorithms at this point. Image above: Pupil Center Corneal Reflection (PCCR). The light reflecting from the cornea and the center of the pupil are used to inform the eye tracker about the movement and direction of the eye. The accuracy of eye movement measurement heavily relies on a clear demarcation of the pupil and detection of corneal reflection. The visible spectrum is likely to generate uncontrolledreflections, while illuminating the eye with infrared light – which is not perceivable by the human eye – renders the demarcation of the pupil and the iris an easy task – while the light directly enters the pupil, it just reflects from the iris', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'online_article', 'title': 'Eye Tracking: The Complete Pocket Guide', 'author': 'Morten Pedersen', 'source': 'https://imotions.com/blog/learning/best-practice/eye-tracking/', 'date_published': '2022-08-02 08:00:00+00:00', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Human_computer_interaction_eye_tracking_the_complete_pocket_guide.json_chunk_2', 'course': 'Human_computer_interaction'}, 'bm25_score': 4.018542766571045, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 2.0545242}, {'id': 'Human_computer_interaction_eye_tracking_the_complete_pocket_guide.json_chunk_1', 'text': 'We carry a range of biosensors from the top hardware producers.

The Vestibulo-Ocular Refl ex (VOR). One very important function of the central vestibular system is to keep your eyes pointed in a particular drection, even while you are dancing like a fool. The vestibulo-ocular refl ex (VOR) performs this function. Recall that accurate vision requires the image to remain stable on the retinas despite movement of the head (see Chapter 9). Each eye can be moved by a set of six extraocular mucles. The VOR works by sensing rotations of the head and immediately commanding a compensatory movement of the eyes in the opposite diretion. The movement helps keep your line of sight tightly fi xed on a visual target. Because the VOR is a refl ex triggered by vestibular input rather than visual input, it works amazingly well even in the dark or when your eyes are closed. Imagine driving down a very bumpy road. From constant adjustments by the VOR, your view of the world ahead is quite stable because each bump, and its consequent movement of your head, is compensated by an eye movement. To appreciate how effective your VOR is, compare the stability of a passing object during the bumpy drive as you look at it fi rst with your eyes alone, and then with the viewfi nder of a simple camera. You’ll fi nd that your camera view jumps around hopelessly because your arms are not nearly quick or accurate enough to move the camera with each bump. Many cameras now have an electromechanical equivalent of a VOR that stabilizes an image even when the camera or the photogrpher holding it is bumping around. The effectiveness of the VOR depends on complicated connections from the semicircular canals to the vestibular nucleus to the cranial nerve nclei that excite the extraocular muscles. Figure 11.34, which shows only half of the horizontal component of this circuit, illustrates what happens when the head turns to the left and the VOR induces both eyes to turn right', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Bear_2016_Neuroscience_Exploring_the_Brain', 'author': '', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\cognitive_neuroscience\\pdf_material\\Bear_2016_Neuroscience_Exploring_the_Brain.pdf', 'date_published': '2015-01-14', 'keywords': '', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'cognitive_neuroscience_bear_2016_neuroscience_exploring_the_brain_page-369-413.json_chunk_67', 'course': 'cognitive_neuroscience'}, 'bm25_score': 3.78531813621521, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 0.79715526}, {'id': 'Human_computer_interaction_measuring_the_user_experience_page-177-193.json_chunk_2', 'text': "". In one way, eye tracking is based on a set of research questions that necessitate the need to analyze eye movements. This might involve comparing the visual attention patterns of two different web designs. In order to answer this question, the researcher must collect and analyze eye movement data. In this case, the “hit ratio” would tell them the percentage of participants who notice (or fixate) on an object in one web design compared to another web design. Another way in which eye tracking is often used in user research is simply to generate real-time qualitative insights. A stakeholder might be interested in observing the eye movements in real time or as part of a participant recording, without any intention of analyzing the data. Observing eye movements provides an additional layer of data to gain a more complete picture of the user experence. Sometimes, the only associated deliverable is a heat map, with any assocated metrics. No matter what approach you take with eye tracking, it is critical to determine the goals and the desired output before any work begins. The information provided by an eye tracking system can be remarkably useful as part of user research. Simply enabling observers to see where the participant is looking in real time is extremely valuable. Even if you do no further analyses of the eye tracking data, just this real-time display provides insight that would not be possible otherwise. For example, assume a participant is performing a task on a website and there's a link on the homepage that would take him directly to the page required to complete the task. The participant keeps exploring the website, going down dead ends, returning to the homepage, but never reaching the required page. In a situation like this, you would like to know whether the participant ever saw the appropriate link on the homepage or whether he saw the link but dismissed it as not what he wanted (e.g., because of its wording)"", 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Measuring the User Experience (third edition)', 'author': 'Bill ALbert, Tom Tullis', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Human_computer_interaction\\pdf_material\\Measuring the User Experience.pdf', 'date_published': '2022-09-11', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Human_computer_interaction_measuring_the_user_experience_page-177-193.json_chunk_2', 'course': 'Human_computer_interaction'}, 'bm25_score': 3.2358548641204834, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 0.6651652}, {'id': 'Human_computer_interaction_eye_tracking_the_complete_pocket_guide.json_chunk_5', 'text': '. In the following pages, we’ll go through some of the most common application areas for eye tracking, and see how it helps guide new discoveries and insight in each. Neuroscience and psychology utilize eye tracking to analyze the sequence of gaze patterns to gain deeper insights into cognitive processes underlying attention, learning, and memory. How do expectations shape the way we see the world? For example, if you see a picture of a living room, you will have an idea of how the furniture should be arranged. If the scene doesn’t match your expectations, you might be baffled and gaze around the scene as your “scene semantics” (your “rules” of how a living room should look) are violated. Another research area addresses how we encode and recall faces – where do we look to extract the emotional state of others? Eyes and mouth are the most important cues, but there’s definitely a lot more to it. Another research area addresses how we encode and recall faces – where do we look to extract the emotional state of others? Eyes and mouth are the most important cues, but there’s definitely a lot more to it. Eye tracking can also provide insights into processing of text, particularly how eye movements during reading are affected by the emotional content of the texts. Eye tracking can provide crucial information about how we attend to the world – what we see and how we see it. Why is it that some products make an impression on customers while others just don‘t get it right? Eye tracking has become a popular, increasingly vital tool in market research. Many leading brands actively utilize eye tracking to assess customer attention to key messages and advertising as well as to evaluate product performance, product and package design, and overall customer experience. When applied to in-store testing, eye tracking provides information about the ease and difficulty of in-store navigation, search behavior, and purchase choices.

To do this, simply measure the percentage deviation away from a baseline for each participant and average those deviations across the participants. Alternatively, you can measure the percentage of participants who experienced dilated pupils (of a certain amount) while attening to a particular graphic or performing a specific function. 7.8 SUMMARY In this chapter we covered eye tracking as a powerful tool in measuring visual attention and engagement. Eye tracking is becoming much easier to use, more accurate, more versatile and powerful, and even quite affordable. Here’s a \xadsummary of some of the key points to remember. 1. Eye tracking is the best way to measure visual attention of various aspects of a product, such as a website or mobile application. Eye tracing is used to compare the effectiveness of different designs, as well \xadcalculate metrics based on areas of interest. 2. Eye tracking typically works with the use of infrared technology. By comparing the position of the corneal reflection to the pupil, we can calculate the gaze direction at any time. 3. Calibration is a key part to any eye tracking study. It is important to obtain satisfactory calibration so you can accurately measure eye movements. 4. Eye tracking mobile applications require the use of glasses that permit tracking eye movements, and possibly a device stand to better control the testing environment. 5. Visualizations in eye tracking tell the story about where people were looking and when. The most common visualizations are scan paths showing the movement of fixations, along with their duration. Another popular visualization is a heatmap, which depicts the distribution of visual attention from, typically, a group of people. 6. Areas of Interest, or AOIs, are one of the most common ways to anlyze eye tracking data. AOIs are objects on the screen, such as a particular block of text, functionality, or image', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Measuring the User Experience (third edition)', 'author': 'Bill ALbert, Tom Tullis', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Human_computer_interaction\\pdf_material\\Measuring the User Experience.pdf', 'date_published': '2022-09-11', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Human_computer_interaction_measuring_the_user_experience_page-177-193.json_chunk_18', 'course': 'Human_computer_interaction'}, 'bm25_score': 3.3445138931274414, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 0.3265308}]"
what does each visual cortex do,"Based on the provided texts, here's a summary of what each ""visual cortex"" pathway does:

1. **Ventral Pathway (What Pathway)**: This pathway plays a central role in object recognition and provides information about an object's identity. It is also known as the ""what"" pathway. The ventral pathway is specialized in processing visual stimulus properties such as color, form, texture, and complex configurations like faces.

Damage to this pathway can lead to visual agnosia, where individuals have difficulty recognizing objects, even if they are simple stimuli like points of light or lines. However, they may still be able to recognize isolated features of objects or associate colors with objects.

2. **Dorsal Pathway (Where Pathway)**: This pathway provides information about the spatial location of objects and allows for localization in space (""where"" pathway). It is specialized in processing information about an object's position and movement.

Damage to this pathway can lead to difficulties in localizing objects in space, such as difficulty in judging distances or tracking moving objects.

Livingstone and Hubel (1988) proposed that the visual system processes these various dimensions (form, color, and movement) separately. Many different visual pathways and many different areas of the cortex are devoted to visual processing (32 visual areas in the count by Van Essen & DeYoe, 1995 ). Different pathways have cells that are differentially sensitive to color, movement, and orientation. Thus, the visual system analyzes a stimulus into many independent features in specific locations. Such a spatial representation of visual features is called a feature map ( Wolfe, 1994 ), with separate maps for color, orientation, and movement. Thus, if a vertical red bar is moving at a particular location, separate feature maps represent its color as red, its orientation as vertical, and its movement as occurring in that location. As one progresses down the ventral stream (the “what” visual pathway in Figure 2.1 ) one finds neurons that have more complex response functions ( Roe et al., 2012 ). Even in the primary visual cortex there is a distinction between simple cells like those in Figure 2.7 that respond to patterns in specific visual locations and complex cells that respond to similarly simple patterns but in many locations. By the time the ventral stream gets to the inferior temporal cortex, we find cells that respond to complex patterns like hands and faces ( Gross, 2008 ). For example, Figure 2.9 shows the responses of a neuron found in the inferior temporal lobe of a macaque monkey ( Desimone, Albright, Gross, & Bruce, 1984 ). This cell responds to stimuli to the degree that they look like hands and seems somewhat insensitive to the orientation of the hand.

There are many studies like these that show that cortical regions involved in high-level visual processing are activated during the processing of visual imagery. However, the evidence is less clear about activation in the primary visual cortex (areas 17 and 18 in Figure 1.7 ; see also Figure 2.5 ), where visual information first reaches the brain. The O’Craven and Kanwisher (2000) study did find activation in the primary visual cortex during imagery. Such results are important because they suggest that visual imagery includes relatively low-level perceptual processes. However, other studies have not always found activation in the primary visual cortex. For instance, the Roland and Friberg (1985) study illustrated in Figure 4.1 did not find activation in this region (see also Roland, Eriksson, Stone-Elander, & Widen, 1987 ). Kosslyn and Thompson (2003) reviewed 59 brain-imaging studies that looked for activation in early visual areas during imagery. About half of these studies find activation in early visual areas and half do not. Kosslyn and Thompson’s analysis suggests that the studies that find activation in these early visual areas tend to emphasize high-resolution details of the images and tend to focus on shape judgments. For example, Kosslyn et al. (1993) found activation in area 17 in a study where participants were asked to imagine block letters. In one of their experiments, participants were asked to imagine large versus small letters. In the small-letter condition, activity in the visual cortex occurred in a more posterior region, closer to where the center of the visual field is represented. This makes sense because a small image would be more concentrated at the center of the visual field. Imaging studies like these show that perceptual regions of the brain are active when participants engage in mental imagery, but they do not establish whether these regions are actually critical to imagery', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications', 'author': 'John R.

Description - People can focus their attention on nonfoveal parts of the visual field and can change their focus of attention to process what they are interested in. The Neural Basis of Visual Attention It appears that the neural mechanisms underlying visual attention are very similar to those underlying auditory attention. Just as auditory attention directed to one ear enhances the cortical signal from that ear, visual attention directed to a spatial location appears to enhance the cortical signal from that location. If a person attends to a particular spatial location, a distinct neural response (detected using ERP records) in the visual cortex occurs within 70 to 90 ms after the onset of a stimulus. On the other hand, when a person is attending to a particular object (attending to a chair rather than a table, say) rather than to a particular location in space, we do not see a response for more than 200 ms. Thus, it appears to take more effort to direct visual attention on the basis of content than on the basis of physical features, just as is the case with auditory attention. Mangun, Hillyard, and Luck (1993) had participants fixate on the center of a computer screen, then judge the lengths of bars presented in positions different from the fixation location (upper left, lower left, upper right, and lower right). Figure 3.10 shows the distribution of scalp activity detected by ERP when a participant was attending to each of these four different regions of the visual array (while fixating on the center of the screen). Consistent with the topographic organization of the visual cortex, there was greatest activity over the side of the scalp opposite the side of the visual field where the object appeared. Recall from Chapters 1 and 2 (see Figure 2.5 ) that the visual cortex (at the back of the brain) is topographically organized, with each visual field (left or right) represented in the opposite hemisphere', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications', 'author': 'John R.

Consider the following sequence of handwritten digits: Most people effortlessly recognize those digits as 504192. That ease is deceptive. In each hemisphere of our brain, humans have a primary visual cortex, also known as V 1 , containing 140 million neurons, with tens of billions of connections between them. And yet human vision involves not just V 1 , but an entire series of visual cortices – V 2 , V 3 , V 4 , and V 5 – doing progressively more complex image processing. We carry in our heads a supercomputer, tuned by evolution over hundreds of millions of years, and superbly adapted to understand the visual world. Recognizing handwritten digits isn’t easy. Rather, we humans are stupendously, astoundingly good at making sense of what our eyes show us. But nearly all that work is done unconsciously. And so we don’t usually appreciate how tough a problem our visual systems solve. The difficulty of visual pattern recognition becomes apparent if you attempt to write a computer program to recognize digits like those above. What seems easy when we do it ourselves suddenly becomes extremely difficult. Simple intuitions about how we recognize shapes – “a 9 has a loop at the top, and a vertical stroke in the bottom right” – turn out to be not so simple to express algorithmically. When you try to make such rules precise, you quickly get lost in a morass of exceptions and caveats and special cases. It seems hopeless. Neural networks approach the problem in a different way. The idea is to take a large number of handwritten digits, known as training examples, and then develop a system which can learn from those training examples. In other words, the neural network uses the examples to automatically infer rules for recognizing handwritten digits. Furthermore, by increasing the number of training examples, the network can learn more about handwriting, and so improve its accuracy', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'nielsen_neuralnetworksanddeeplearning', 'author': '', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\master_courses\\Natural_language_processing\\pdf_material\\nielsen_neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.pdf', 'date_published': '2018-09-11', 'keywords': '', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'Natural_language_processing_nielsen_neuralnetworksanddeeplearning_page-1-38.json_chunk_1', 'course': 'Natural_language_processing'}, 'bm25_score': 4.469334125518799, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 1.0618126}, {'id': 'intro_to_cognitive_science_cognitive_psychology_and_its_implications_page-1-851.json_chunk_64', 'text': '. Optic nerve fibers synapse onto cells in subcortical structures, such as the lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus. Both structures are connected to the visual cortex. Description The illustration depicts the visual cortex on the occipital lobe of right and left hemispheres. The nerves from the visual cortex connect to superior colliculus and lateral geniculate nucleus. The nerves from the lateral geniculate nucleus meet the optic chiasm and the ganglion cell axons cross over and go opposite to the corresponding hemispheres. The left halves of both eyes are connected to the left hemisphere and the right halves of both eyes are connected to the right hemisphere. The dashed lines projecting from the eyes toward left and right regions of the brain mark the range of sight. Two ovals are presented at the point where the dashed lines end and overlap in the middle. Once inside the brain, the fibers from the ganglion cells synapse onto cells in various subcortical structures. These subcortical structures (such as the lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus in Figure 2.4 ) are connected to the primary visual cortex (area 17 in Figure 1.7 ). The primary visual cortex is the first cortical area to receive visual input, but there are many other visual areas. Figure 2.5 illustrates the topographic representation of the visual field in the primary visual cortex (as discussed in Chapter 1 ). The fovea receives a disproportionate representation while the peripheral areas receive less representation ( Figure 1.9 illustrates a similar disproportionate neural representation in the somatosensory cortex). Figure 2.5 shows that the left visual field is represented in the right cortex and the right in the left cortex. It also illustrates another “reversal” of the mapping — the upper part of the visual field is represented in the lower part of the visual cortex and the lower part is represented in the upper region.

Fraser, 1908.) 333 CHAPTER 10 THE CENTRAL VISUAL SYSTEM thalamus and the primary visual cortex, also called area 17 , V1 , or the striate cortex . We will see that the information funneled through this gniculocortical pathway is processed in parallel by neurons specialized for the analysis of different stimulus attributes. The striate cortex then feeds this information to more than two dozen extrastriate cortical areas in the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes, and many of these appear to be specialized for different types of analysis. Much of what we know about the central visual system was fi rst worked out in the domestic cat and then extended to the rhesus monkey, Macaca mulatta . The macaque monkey, as it is also called, relies heavily on vision for survival in its habitat, as do we humans. In fact, tests of the performance of this primate’s visual system show that in virtually all respects, it rivals that of humans. Thus, although most of this chapter concerns the organization of the macaque visual system most neuroscentists agree that it approximates very closely the situation in our own brain. Visual neuroscience cannot yet explain every aspect of visual peception (Figure 10.1). However, signifi cant progress has been made in answering a basic question: How do neurons represent the different facets of the visual world? By examining those stimuli that make diferent neurons in the visual cortex respond, and how these response properties arise, we begin to see how the brain portrays the visual world around us. THE RETINOFUGAL PROJECTION The neural pathway that leaves the eye, beginning with the optic nerve, is often referred to as the retinofugal projection . The suffi x -fugal is from the Latin word meaning “to fl ee” and is commonly used in neuranatomy to describe a pathway that is directed away from a structure', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Bear_2016_Neuroscience_Exploring_the_Brain', 'author': '', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\cognitive_neuroscience\\pdf_material\\Bear_2016_Neuroscience_Exploring_the_Brain.pdf', 'date_published': '2015-01-14', 'keywords': '', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'cognitive_neuroscience_bear_2016_neuroscience_exploring_the_brain_page-331-367.json_chunk_3', 'course': 'cognitive_neuroscience'}, 'bm25_score': 4.982697010040283, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 0.6610825}, {'id': 'perception_and_action_hommel_2016_human_action_control___from_intentions_to_movements_page-75-105.json_chunk_6', 'text': '. However, in recent years, this assumption has been doubted increasingly, especially in the light of neurophysiological and neuropsychological evidence that suggests the parallel processing of information from the retina through two separate cortical pathways: a so-called ventral pathway that projects from the primary visual cortex (BA17 or V1) into the inferotemporal cortex and a so-called dorsal pathway that projects from the primary visual cortex into the posterior parietal cortex (Fig. 4.2 ). In groundbreaking experiments with monkeys, 4.1 Dissociations of Perception and Action 80 Ungerleider and Mishkin ( 1982 ) have shown that the ventral pathway plays a central role in the recognition of objects and provides information about the identity of objects (hence it is also known as the “what” pathway). The dorsal pathway, in contrast, provides information about the spatial location of objects and allows for the localization of objects in space (“where” pathway). 4.1.2.1 Consequences of Selective Damage to Visual Pathways Neural systems in the ventral processing pathway are specialized in, among other things, the registration and identifi cation of visual stimulus properties like color, form, and texture, but also more complex stimulus confi gurations, such as faces. Therefore, damage to the ventral processing pathway can lead to massive losses in recognition performance and is often associated with visual agnosia . Patients with visual agnosia can often recognize simple visual stimuli, like points of light or lines, but fail to recognize more complicated confi gurations. They also fail to identify the outlines of objects, nor can they associate colors and objects with each other (cf. Box 4.1 ). So, visual agnosia does not infl uence the identifi cation of isolated features of objects but the integration of individual features into a unifi ed and coheent perceptual impression (“percept”).

Neurons are by no means the majority of cells in the nervous system. There are many other cell types, such as glial cells, whose main function is thought to be supportive of the neurons. The term “cerebral cortex” is widely used to refer just to the neocortex, and I have largely adopted that usage in this book, as well as using just “cortex” as a short way of referring to the cerebral cortex or neocortex. In places where the distinction is important, I have used the more specific “neocortex.” 1 2 3 Chapter 2 Perception Our bodies are bristling with sensory receptors — neurons that detect sights, sounds, smells, and physical contact. Billions of neurons process sensory information and deliver what they find to the higher centers in the brain. This chapter will focus on visual perception and, to a lesser extent, on audition as it is involved in the perception of speech — the two most important perceptual systems for the human species. The chapter will address the following questions: How does the brain extract information from the visual signal? How is visual information organized into objects? How are the sounds of speech (phonemes) recognized? How are visual and speech patterns recognized? How does context affect pattern recognition? Visual Perception in the Brain Humans have a big neural investment in processing visual information. This is illustrated in Figure 2.1 , which shows some of the cortical structures devoted to processing information from vision and hearing. This investment in vision is part of our “inheritance” as primates, which have evolved to devote as much as 50% of their brains to visual processing ( Barton, 1998 ). The enormous investment underlies the human ability to see the world. Figure 2.1 Some of the Cortical Structures Involved in Vision and Audition. The visual cortex, the “where” visual pathway, and the “what” visual pathway are important in processing information from vision; the auditory cortex is important in processing information from hearing', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications', 'author': 'John R.
