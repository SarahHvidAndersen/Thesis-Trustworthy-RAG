please explain shared attention,"Nice question!

Based on the provided context, shared attention refers to the mutual understanding and direction of attention between interacting agents involved in a communicative situation. This phenomenon is characterized by the coordination of gaze-following, pointing, and verbal language use (e.g., Carpenter et al., 1998; Tomasello, 1999; Talmy, 2000) that enables them to share information and meaning.

In particular, shared attention involves profiling and structuring joint-attentional scenes through linguistic contributions, which are often underdetermined without contextual specification (Raczaszek-Leonardi & Kelso, 2008). For instance, in the example provided, the utterance ""Are you picking them up today?"" only makes sense within a specific situational context that specifies the intended meaning of the personal pronouns ""you"" and ""them"", as well as the verb ""to pick up"".","[""Nice question!\n\nBased on the provided context, shared attention refers to the mutual understanding and direction of attention between interacting agents involved in a communicative situation.

This process is considered a fundamental aspect of human sociality. In other words, shared attention involves coordinating one's focus with someone else's, allowing for mutual understanding and communication.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on this topic or explore related concepts in cognitive science?"", ""A question about shared attention!\n\nIn the context of cognition and communication, shared attention refers to the joint focus of two or more individuals on a particular object, event, or concept. This phenomenon is characterized by mutual gaze-following and pointing, which enables individuals to engage in cooperative activities and share meaning.\n\nShared attention is thought to be an essential aspect of human sociality, as it allows for the coordination of actions, the exchange of information, and the establishment of common ground. In infancy, shared attention emerges through pre-linguistic interactions between caregivers and infants, where gaze-following and pointing serve as primary tools for directing and sharing attention.\n\nAs language develops, verbal language becomes another means for directing and sharing attention, enabling individuals to reorganize and profile their joint attentional scenes. The utterance \""Are you picking them up today?\"" illustrates how shared attention relies on situational context and the ability to specify intended meanings through linguistic cues (personal pronouns, verbs, etc.).\n\nIn summary, shared attention is a fundamental aspect of human social interaction that facilitates cooperative behavior, information exchange, and meaning construction."", ""A great question about cognition and communication!\n\nBased on the provided context, I can summarize that shared attention is characterized by joint-attentional activities between individuals. This includes gaze-following and pointing, which are essential for understanding and coordinating with each other's intentions.

This means that the meaning of a communication situation relies heavily on the shared situational context between interacting agents.\n\nIn essence, shared attention allows individuals to \""get on the same page\"" and understand each other's perspectives, which is vital for effective communication!"", ""Based on the provided context, shared attention refers to the joint-attentional activities between two interacting agents, such as gaze-following and pointing, which enable them to share and direct their attention towards a common focus.

While the practice of gaze-following and pointing has been found to subserve joint attention in pre-linguistic infant-adult interactions (Carpenter et al ., 1998), in later stages of development verbal language lends itself as another tool for directing and sharing attention (Tomasello, 1999; Talmy, 2000). The function of language as profiling and structuring joint attentional scenes, rather than representing them, finds support in the observation that the linguistic contribution to the overall meaning of communicative situations is often largely underdetermined (Raczaszek-Leonardi and Kelso, 2008). Consider the utterance: ‘Are you picking them up today?’ Though the sentence is composed of high frequency words in a conventional interrogative construction, and at first glance seems perfectly meaningful, in fact the utterance makes little sense when detached from the situational context in which it is spoken (Wallentin et al ., 2006). Is it about kids being collected from daycare? Or little pearls that have fallen on the floor during a creative workshop? Or is it about trafficking of illegal drugs? We thus need contextual specification of (at least) the personal pronouns ‘you’ and ‘them’, not to mention the verb ‘to pick up’, in order to grasp the intended meaning of the utterance. To the interacting agents involved in the discourse, the specifications of intended meanings are certainly accessible and present in their shared situational context. What is at stake in the sentence is thus merely a (re)organization and profiling of the already existing state of affairs (e.g. ‘is it me or you ?’, ‘is it today ?’, etc)', 'distance': 0.31267720460891724, 'source': 'semantic', 'rerank_score': 0.9266132}]"

what is an r function for ordinal regression,"A question about statistics in R!

According to the provided context from your Cognitive Science syllabus, there isn't a specific answer about an R function for ordinal regression. The context seems more focused on deep learning and natural language processing.

However, I can provide you with some general information. In R, you can use the `ordinal` package to perform ordinal regression. One of the key functions in this package is `ordinal()`, which fits an ordinal regression model to your data.

Here's a simple example:
```R
library(ordinal)

# Load your data
data <- ...

# Fit an ordinal regression model
model <- ordinal(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data)

# Print the summary of the model
summary(model)

However, we now set loss = 'categorical_crossentropy ' , which extends the binary cross-entropy objective function to outcomes with more than two categories. More formally, the categorical cross-entropy is the log-likelihood of an outcome that follows a multinomial distribution with number of cells equal to the number of outcome categories, cell probabilities predicted by the fitted model, and trial size one. It is the same objective function used for fitting ordinal regression models (Kutner et al., 2004). We fitted and tested the model: history = cnn %>% fit ( train_data$X, as.matrix (train_data$y), epochs = 50, batch_size = 7 ) cnn %>% evaluate (test_data$X, as.matrix (test_data$y)) The first input to fit () is a 683 ◊ 48 ◊ 48 ◊ 1 tensor of training set images and the second input is an outcome vector. We fitted the model for 50 epochs and randomly sampled 7 images for each fitting iteration. Finally, we evaluated our deep CNN on a test set of 30 percent of observations. We include a full R script for our analysis as online supplemental material. Our fitted model obtained a predictive accuracy of 0 . 84 on a test set of 30 percent of observations, suggesting that our images of faces contain objective information that can be used to predict their emotional content. We could possibly increase our model’s predictive accuracy even further either by collecting more data (which could be expensive) or by fitting our model to one of many publicly available large facial expression data sets (e.g., facial expression databases can be found at https://web.archive.org/web/20180325205102/http://emotion-research.net/wiki/Databases or https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~cvrl/database/other_facial_expression.htm) then refining the fitted parameters on our smaller data set using a transfer learning approach.

what is the conclusion of tomasello et al 1999?,"Nice question!

Based on the provided context from your Cognitive Science syllabus, I can answer that for you. Tomasello et al.'s (1999) study found that:

The conclusion is thus that apes and young human chidren both understand in the same basic way (in simple situations) that individuals pursue a goal in a persistent manner until they have reached it—and they understand the goal not as the result produced in the external envronment, but rather as the actor’s internal representation Primate Intentional Communication 47 of the state of the world she wishes to bring about. They also understand that the actor chooses an action to pursue a goal “rationally” in the sense that they consider the actor’s reasons for doing what he is doing. Second, great apes (most of the research is again with chimpanzees) also understand that others have percetions. Evidence is as follows (see Tomasello and Call 2006 for a review): • When a human peers behind a barrier, apes move over to get a better viewing angle to look behind it as well (Tomasello, Hare, and Agnetta 1999; Bräuer et al. 2006; see Moll and Tomasello 2004 for a similar study with human infants). • When a human’s gaze is directed toward a barrier and there is also an object further in that same direction, apes look only to the barrier and not to the object—unless the barrier has a window in it, in which case they look to the object (Okamoto-Barth, Call, and Tomasello 2007; see Caron et al. 2002 for similar fi ndings with human infants). • When apes beg a human for food, they take into account whether the human can see their gesture (Kaminski, Call, and Tomasello 2004; Liebal, Pika, Call, and Tomasello 2004). • When chimpanzees compete with one another for food they take into account whether their competitor can see the contested food (Hare et al. 2000; Hare, Call, Tomasello 2001), and even on occasion attempt to conceal their 48 Chapter 2 approach from a competitor (Hare, Call, Tomasello 2006; Melis, Call, and Tomasello 2006)', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Origins of Human Communication', 'author': 'User', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\cognition_and_communication\\pdf_material\\origins_of_human_communication__michael_tomasello.pdf', 'date_published': '2008-08-14', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'cognition_and_communication_origins_of_human_communication_page-13-55.json_chunk_28', 'course': 'cognition_and_communication'}, 'bm25_score': 9.18919563293457, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 4.1023407}, {'id': 'cognition_and_communication_origins_of_human_communication_page-13-55.json_chunk_29', 'text': '. 2000; Hare, Call, Tomasello 2001), and even on occasion attempt to conceal their 48 Chapter 2 approach from a competitor (Hare, Call, Tomasello 2006; Melis, Call, and Tomasello 2006). The conclusion is thus that apes and young human chidren both understand in the same basic way (in simple situations) that individuals perceive things in the world and react to them—and they understand that the content of the other’s perception is something different from their own. The last-cited competition experiments are especially important because they demonstrate that chimpanzees do not just understand goals and perception separately, but rather understand how they are interrelated in the basic logic of intentional action: agents want certain envronmental states to obtain (have goals); agents see the world and so can assess the situation with respect to the desired goal state; and agents do things when they peceive that the environment is not in the desired goal state. This kind of understanding of intentional action supports a basic form of practical reasoning that enables individals to understand and predict what others are doing and will do, even in novel circumstances. Thus, in the Hare et al. competition experiments, participants understand that if their competitor can see his goal (the food) he will pursue it, whereas if he cannot see it he will not pursue it; and conversely, if the competitor sees something that is not its goal (e.g., a rock), he will not pursue that. And they can understand basic things about opportunities and obstacles to goals for others in novel situations—for Primate Intentional Communication 49 example, when the other has a free path to food or his path is blocked—and how this affects their behavioral choices', 'metadata': {'document_type': 'book', 'title': 'Origins of Human Communication', 'author': 'User', 'source': 'raw_syllabi\\bachelor_courses\\cognition_and_communication\\pdf_material\\origins_of_human_communication__michael_tomasello.pdf', 'date_published': '2008-08-14', 'keywords': 'Unavailable', 'flag': '', 'chunk_id': 'cognition_and_communication_origins_of_human_communication_page-13-55.json_chunk_29', 'course': 'cognition_and_communication'}, 'bm25_score': 6.388096809387207, 'source': 'bm25', 'rerank_score': 3.014637}]"
